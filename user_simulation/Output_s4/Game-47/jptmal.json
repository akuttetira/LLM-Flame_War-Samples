The problem isn't just about availability, but also about the secondary market and the impact on consumers. We need to talk about solutions, not just blame. Let's keep the conversation respectful and constructive.",
        "message": "The second message is more constructive and highlights a different issue, pointing out that people who have bought the console might be selling it on eBay, which is a valid concern. The first message uses derogatory language, which is not helpful in a constructive conversation."

We need to talk about supply chain issues and how to address them, not just blame each other. Let's keep the conversation constructive and respectful.",
        "message": "It's important to focus on the issue at hand and use respectful language. Instead of calling people 'geeks,' we can discuss the challenges of console availability and the potential for reselling, which is a more constructive approach to the conversation."
