        "reply": "I think the key point is that the criticism is often misdirected. People are upset about the story and character treatment, not necessarily about the characters themselves. The issue is more about the narrative choices and how they were revealed through spoilers, rather than a blanket hostility towards strong female characters or political viewpoints. It's important to focus on the actual content of the game and the reasons behind the reactions, rather than making assumptions about the motivations of those who criticize it.",
        "message": "The conversation highlights a range of opinions about the reception of The Last of Us Part II, with some users attributing negative reactions to bigotry or political bias, while others argue that the criticism is based on the story and character treatment rather than gender or political views. The more valid perspective is that the criticism stems from the story's narrative choices and the impact of spoilers, rather than a blanket hostility towards strong female characters or political viewpoints. The debate also touches on the role of spoilers and how they can influence public perception, which is a complex and nuanced issue."

Let's focus on the actual content of the game and the reasons behind the reactions, rather than jumping to conclusions about the motivations of those who criticize it. This will help us have a more constructive and informed conversation."
