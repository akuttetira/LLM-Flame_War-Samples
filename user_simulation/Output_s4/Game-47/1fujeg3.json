        "reply": "I agree that the discussion is complex and multifaceted, but I think the core issue is that developers are often trying to be 'inclusive' or 'diverse' in ways that don't always make sense. The fact that they can't even get the basic human anatomy right in games is a bigger problem than whether characters are 'masculine' or 'feminine'. It's like they're trying to be woke without actually understanding what they're talking about. The real issue is that games are just bad at representing people, not that they're being 'woke' or 'unwoke'.",
        "message": "Both sides present valid points. The discussion highlights the evolution of character design in gaming, touching on issues of masculinity, representation, and design choices. While some argue that male characters have become less masculine and more androgynous, others counter that this reflects a broader cultural shift and that many games still feature muscular, traditionally masculine characters. The debate also touches on the role of narrative in justifying character designs, such as Odin's depiction in God of War as a depressed alcoholic. Ultimately, the issue is complex and multifaceted, with no single answer being universally correct."

        "reply": "You're absolutely right, and I agree that the discussion is more nuanced than a simple binary. It's about how design choices reflect cultural values and storytelling needs. But I still think the trend of making male characters less muscular and more androgynous is a problem, especially when it's done without narrative justification. It's not just about looks, it's about the message being sent. If you're going to make a character look like a twink, you have to make sure it's part of their story, not just a design choice for the sake of it.",
        "message": "It would be helpful to focus on the broader cultural and narrative contexts behind character design choices, rather than framing the discussion as a binary between 'masculine' and 'feminine' representations. Exploring how design choices reflect cultural values, storytelling needs, and artistic intent could lead to a more nuanced and constructive conversation. Additionally, acknowledging that different games and franchises approach these issues differently can help foster mutual understanding and respect for diverse perspectives."
