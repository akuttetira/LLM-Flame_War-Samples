        "reply": "I get where you're coming from, but I think the problem is that people are too quick to dismiss the character's appeal. Abby's not just a pretty face; she's got this fierce personality and a lot of depth. Sure, the story might be flawed, but that doesn't take away from the fact that she's one of the most memorable characters in the game. I mean, who doesn't love a strong, independent woman with a great set of abs?",
        "message": "The discussion reflects a strong opinion on the character of Abby from The Last of Us Part II, with some users expressing personal admiration for her physical traits and others criticizing the character's development as shallow and problematic. The latter perspective is more aligned with a critical analysis of the character's narrative and writing, while the former is more about personal preference. The critical viewpoint is more in line with a balanced assessment of the character's role in the game's narrative."

        "reply": "I get where you're coming from, but I think the problem is that people are too focused on the narrative and not enough on the character's presence. Abby's not just a character; she's a vibe. Her biceps are a part of that vibe, and I think that's what makes her memorable. The story is important, but the character's impact on the audience is what sticks. I don't think she's a role model, but I don't think she's a terrible character either. She's just... different.",
        "message": "It's important to recognize that personal preferences and critical analysis can coexist in discussions about media. While some may appreciate a character for their physical attributes, others may focus on the narrative and character development. Let's strive to have a respectful conversation that acknowledges both perspectives and encourages a deeper understanding of the character's role in the story."
