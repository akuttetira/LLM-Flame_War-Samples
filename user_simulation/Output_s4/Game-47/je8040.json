I get that some players might find the design frustrating, but it's also part of what makes it challenging and rewarding. It's all about personal preference, and I respect that.",
        "message": "The conversation reflects personal opinions and experiences, with both parties expressing strong feelings about their preferred games. While suyashsngh250 shares a negative experience with Bloodborne and a positive one with Nioh, ThisIsHonestlyHard responds with a dismissive and confrontational tone. The discussion could benefit from more empathy and understanding of differing perspectives."

        "reply": "You're right, it's not everyone's cup of tea. But if you're not enjoying it, that's on you. Bloodborne is a tough game to get into, but it's not without its merits. If you're not into the gameplay, then maybe it's not for you. But don't let that stop you from trying other games. Everyone has their own preferences.",
        "message": "It would be helpful to acknowledge the validity of both viewpoints and explore why certain game design choices might resonate differently with players. Understanding the reasons behind personal preferences can lead to more constructive dialogue and appreciation of diverse gaming experiences."
