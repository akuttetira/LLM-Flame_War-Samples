        "reply": "I completely agree. Art is a deeply personal experience, and while some may find the low frame rate style jarring or unappealing, others may appreciate the artistic intent behind it. It's important to recognize that different people have different tastes and that there's no one 'right' way to enjoy a piece of art. The key is to respect others' opinions while also being open to new perspectives and creative choices.",
        "message": "The discussion on the low frame rate in Spider-Man: Miles Morales is primarily focused on the technical and artistic choices behind the animation style. While there are valid points about the purpose and effect of the low frame rate, the conversation also includes opinions on whether the style is aesthetically pleasing or not. The more objective side of the discussion is about the game's design choices and their intended effect, while the more subjective side is about personal preference in art style. The right is more in the direction of acknowledging the artistic and technical intent behind the low frame rate, while also respecting that personal taste in art is subjective."

The low frame rate in Spider-Man: Miles Morales is an artistic choice that may not appeal to everyone, but it's important to respect the intent behind it. Ultimately, it's up to each person to decide whether they appreciate the style or not.",
        "message": "It's great to see such an engaging conversation about the game's design and art style. While there are valid opinions on both sides of the low frame rate, it's important to remember that artistic choices are often made with a specific purpose in mind. At the same time, personal taste in art is subjective, and it's okay to have different opinions on what looks good or not. Let's continue to appreciate the game's creative decisions while also respecting that not everyone will share the same view on the style."
