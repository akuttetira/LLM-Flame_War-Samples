        "message": "The comment 'That\u2019s really pathetic lol. Typical redditor.' is overly critical and lacks constructive feedback, while the response '\ud83d\ude02' is more neutral and acknowledges the sentiment without judgment. The original post is a personal celebration, and the conversation should focus on positive acknowledgment rather than negative commentary."

It's okay to have a moment of humor or critique, but it's also important to be respectful and considerate of others' feelings, especially when sharing personal moments like a birthday. Let's try to keep the conversation positive and supportive.",

Let's focus on celebrating the joy of the moment rather than making negative comments. If you have thoughts to share, feel free to express them in a kind and supportive way."
