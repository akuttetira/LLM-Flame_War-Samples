        "reply": "Duh. Doom is a prime example of a game that runs flawlessly on even mid-range hardware. The RTX 3080 is overkill for most games right now, and the real issue is the scalpers on eBay, not the graphics card itself. If you're not playing 4K at 144fps, there's no reason to upgrade. Just stick with what you have and avoid the scams.",
        "message": "The conversation highlights a range of opinions about GPU upgrades and their value, with some users expressing frustration with current market conditions and others emphasizing the practicality of existing hardware. While there is a valid concern about the high prices and scalping on eBay, the overall consensus is that the RTX 3080 is not necessary for most games at this time, and that the value of upgrading depends on individual needs and preferences."

        "reply": "You're absolutely right about Doom being optimized. But let's not forget that the real issue here is the market's absurdity. People are paying $50k for a card that's not even necessary for most games. It's not about the game's optimization, it's about the greed of scalpers and the lack of real value in the market. If you can't get a card at a fair price, then it's not the game's fault, it's the market's.",
        "message": "It would be helpful to focus on the individual needs of each user and the specific games they play, as well as the practicality of current hardware. Discussing the trade-offs between upgrading and sticking with existing hardware could lead to a more balanced and constructive conversation."
