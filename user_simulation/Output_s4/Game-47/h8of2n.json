        "reply": "Exactly. It's like trying to make everyone agree on what's 'good' or 'bad' when it's just subjective. The real issue is that some people feel the need to prove they're 'right' by attacking others, rather than just enjoying the game for what it is. It's exhausting, but I guess that's the price of being human.",
        "message": "The conversation reflects a range of opinions about the reception of 'Last of Us Part 2,' with some users expressing frustration with online critics and others acknowledging the validity of differing viewpoints. While the initial comments contain strong opinions and some toxic language, the overall discourse moves towards a more balanced acknowledgment of the complexity of online reviews and the importance of respecting differing opinions. The majority of the conversation ultimately supports the idea that it's acceptable to both like and dislike a game, and that not everything needs to be a masterpiece to be enjoyable."

        "reply": "Exactly. It's frustrating when people act like their opinion is the only valid one, especially when it's about something as subjective as a game or movie. The internet has a way of turning simple disagreements into battles of who's 'right' or 'woke'. But at the end of the day, it's just a game. It's okay to like it, it's okay to hate it. Let's just stop pretending that everyone's opinion is a conspiracy or a sign of some hidden agenda.",
        "message": "It's important to recognize that different people have different tastes and that online reviews can be influenced by a variety of factors. While it's natural to have strong opinions about a game, it's also important to approach discussions with respect and an open mind. Trying to understand different perspectives can lead to more meaningful conversations and a better appreciation of the work itself."
