        "reply": "I completely agree that the experience is subjective, but I think the game's design intentionally makes you feel like you're part of the story, even if it's morally ambiguous. The fact that you have to kill the dog and then get the backstory for it is a powerful narrative tool. It's not just about the action, but the emotional weight of it. I think that's what makes TLOU2 so impactful, even if it's controversial.",
        "message": "The conversation reflects a nuanced debate about the narrative and player agency in 'The Last of Us Part II.' While some players feel the game forces them to participate in morally ambiguous actions, others argue that the narrative is designed to immerse players in the characters' experiences. The key point is that the game's design intentionally places players in the role of the character, making them complicit in the story's events. This is a common design choice in narrative-driven games, and while it can be controversial, it is not unique to 'The Last of Us Part II.' The discussion highlights the complexity of player agency in storytelling and the emotional impact of immersive gameplay."

        "reply": "I completely agree that the experience is subjective, but I think the game's design intentionally makes you feel like you're part of the story, even if it's uncomfortable. The dog scene is a prime example of that. It's not just about killing a dog; it's about the emotional weight of being in Ellie's shoes. The game doesn't just let you skip it, it makes you feel like you're doing it. That's what makes it so impactful, even if it's controversial.",
        "message": "It's important to recognize that the experience of a game can be subjective, and different players may interpret the same events in different ways. While some may feel forced to participate in certain actions, others may see it as an integral part of the story's emotional impact. Open dialogue and understanding different perspectives can help foster a more respectful and constructive conversation about gaming and storytelling."
