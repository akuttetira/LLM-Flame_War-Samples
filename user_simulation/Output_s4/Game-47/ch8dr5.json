        "reply": "EA is definitely a major player in the downfall of studios, but it's not the only factor. The gaming industry is a complex ecosystem with many variables at play. While I agree that EA has a history of problematic acquisitions, it's also true that the industry as a whole has evolved in ways that can be both positive and negative. The CDPR situation is a prime example of how consumer expectations and corporate decisions can clash. I think the key is to understand the bigger picture and not just focus on one company or one issue.",
        "message": "The conversation reflects a mix of opinions on CDPR's business decisions, EA's influence on game studios, and debates around fanboyism and SJW culture. While some argue that EA is responsible for the decline of studios like BioWare, others believe that the industry's challenges are more complex and not solely attributable to EA. The debate around CDPR's pre-order bonus also highlights differing views on consumer expectations and game development practices. Ultimately, the discussion is opinionated and lacks a clear consensus, with valid points on both sides regarding the role of corporate influence and industry trends."

        "reply": "I think the key point is that EA has a history of buying studios and then not supporting them properly. It's not just about CDPR or BioWare, but a pattern that's been repeating in the gaming industry. I'm not saying EA is the only problem, but they definitely play a role in the downfall of these companies. It's a sad reality that many studios are just shells of what they once were.",
        "message": "It would be helpful to focus on the broader industry trends and the complex factors that influence game development companies, rather than getting bogged down in specific accusations or opinions. A more constructive dialogue could explore how corporate ownership, consumer expectations, and industry pressures interact to shape the gaming landscape. This would allow for a more balanced and informative discussion."
