        "reply": "I completely agree. It's frustrating when people dismiss valid concerns about EGS just because they're not 'organic' or because they're 'salty Steam fans.' The conversation is full of valid experiences and arguments, but it's also full of people who seem to be defending EGS not just for its features, but for some deeper, unspoken reason. It's like they're not just defending a product, but a movement. And that's what makes it so hard to have a real discussion about what's actually working and what's not.",
        "message": "The conversation highlights concerns about potential shill activity on Reddit and other platforms, with users pointing out patterns of behavior that suggest coordinated promotion of Epic Games Store (EGS) and its features. While some users defend EGS with passionate arguments, others argue that these defenses are not based on genuine user experience but rather on coordinated efforts. The discussion also touches on broader issues of online shill culture, astroturfing, and the role of moderation in preventing such practices. The majority of the conversation leans towards the view that the level of defense for EGS is suspicious and potentially orchestrated, though some users argue that EGS has legitimate user support. Overall, the conversation is more in line with the perspective that the level of EGS defense is suspicious and not entirely organic."

        "reply": "I agree that it's easy to jump to conclusions about shill activity, but the level of defense for EGS is definitely suspicious. It's like a cult, and I'm starting to think that the people defending EGS are not just passionate users but part of some coordinated effort. It's frustrating because it's hard to tell the real users from the paid promoters.",
        "message": "It's clear that there's a strong belief among some users that the level of support for EGS is not entirely organic, and that there may be coordinated efforts behind it. At the same time, there are valid points made about the value of EGS features and the experiences of users who do support them. To move forward, it would be helpful to focus on the actual experiences and arguments of users, rather than jumping to conclusions about shill activity. Let's try to engage in a more constructive discussion about the features of EGS and the experiences of users who use it, rather than focusing on potential coordination or shill activity."
