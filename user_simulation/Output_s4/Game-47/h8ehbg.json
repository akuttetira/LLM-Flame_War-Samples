The game itself is amazing, and the hate towards it is just a reflection of the toxic environment in some subreddits. Let's focus on the game and the experiences of those who enjoyed it, rather than the negativity that surrounds it.",
        "message": "The conversation highlights the presence of extreme negativity and hostility within the subreddit for The Last of Us Part II, with many users expressing frustration and disappointment with the level of toxic behavior. While it is valid to critique the sub's environment, the focus on hate and misinformation overshadows constructive discussion. The majority of users seem to agree that the sub has become a space for irrational and harmful discourse, which is not representative of the broader gaming community."

The fact that people are so quick to dismiss the game based on leaks and not even playing it is frustrating. The game itself is a masterpiece, and the hate on that sub is just a reflection of the idiots who got drawn into the drama.",
        "message": "It's important to acknowledge the valid concerns about the toxicity in the subreddit, but let's focus on the broader context of gaming culture and how we can support positive, respectful conversations. Let's avoid generalizing the entire community based on the actions of a few and instead focus on the game itself and the experiences of those who enjoyed it."
