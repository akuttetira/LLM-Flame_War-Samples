        "reply": "I completely agree that the conversation has veered into a more contentious debate about PewDiePie's character than it should. While it's important to have discussions about his past actions, the original topic was about the design. Let's refocus on the design and its inspiration. If you have any thoughts or questions about it, I'd be happy to hear them. And if you're interested in the broader debate about PewDiePie, we can approach it with more care and nuance.",
        "message": "The conversation contains a mix of opinions, with some users expressing admiration for the design, others questioning its inspiration, and a significant portion engaging in a debate about PewDiePie's character and the implications of his past statements. While the design discussion is the central topic, the debate around PewDiePie's actions and the media's portrayal of him becomes a secondary, more contentious issue. The majority of the conversation is opinionated and polarizing, with valid points on both sides regarding the design and the broader debate about PewDiePie. However, the debate around his character is more opinionated and less grounded in factual consensus, making it a point of contention that could be more objectively addressed."

        "reply": "I totally get where you're coming from, but let's not forget that the design is just a design. The debate about PewDiePie is a separate issue that's been going on for way longer than this. I think it's important to keep the conversation focused on what's being discussed here, which is the design. If anyone wants to dive deeper into the PewDiePie controversy, that's fine, but let's make sure we're respectful and not letting personal biases cloud our judgment. The design is what's in front of us, and that's what we should be talking about.",
        "message": "It would be helpful to focus more on the design itself and the creative inspiration behind it, rather than diverting into a broader debate about PewDiePie's character. While it's important to acknowledge the complexity of the situation, keeping the conversation centered on the design and its inspiration would allow for a more constructive and respectful exchange. If you'd like to discuss the design, we can explore that further. If you're interested in the broader debate about PewDiePie, we can approach that with more care and nuance."
