        "reply": "Exactly. The problem is that people are using terms like 'Marxist' to dismiss the real issues facing Black people. It's a way to distract from the systemic racism and oppression that BLM is trying to combat. We need to focus on the actual struggles and not get bogged down in ideological debates.",
        "message": "The conversation reflects a range of opinions on BLM, Marxism, and related social issues. While some participants argue that BLM is not inherently Marxist and that the movement is decentralized, others criticize the movement's alignment with Marxist ideologies. The debate also touches on broader social justice issues, historical context, and political rhetoric. The key point is that BLM is a complex movement with diverse perspectives, and it is important to recognize its goals while acknowledging the nuances of its ideological influences."

        "reply": "When they learn that black people are people, and that the movement is about justice, not ideology. They need to stop equating BLM with Marxism and start seeing it as a movement for equality. The real issue is systemic racism, not political labels.",
        "message": "It is important to approach this discussion with respect and nuance. BLM is a movement focused on racial justice and police accountability, and while some individuals or groups may have ideological ties to Marxism, the movement itself is not inherently Marxist. Similarly, the criticisms of BLM should be balanced with an understanding of its goals and the broader context of social justice. Let's focus on the shared goal of promoting equality and justice, and avoid using divisive language that may escalate tensions."
