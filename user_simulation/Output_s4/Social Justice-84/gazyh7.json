The mods might be right-wingers, but that doesn't mean the historical facts are wrong. Let's keep the conversation focused on the facts, not the sub's culture.",
        "message": "The user's statement about the Nazis attacking the Jews not being due to racism is historically inaccurate. The Holocaust was a result of Nazi ideology rooted in racism, anti-Semitism, and the belief in a master race. The other comments about the sub and its mods are more about the sub's culture than historical facts."

The Holocaust was a result of Nazi racism, not 'allied propaganda.' The sub's culture is a separate issue, but when someone tries to twist history, that's when we need to call them out. We can talk about the sub's culture, but the Holocaust is a historical fact that can't be ignored or minimized.",
        "message": "It's important to distinguish between historical facts and cultural discussions. While the sub may have a right-wing culture, that doesn't negate the historical reality of the Holocaust. Let's focus on accurate historical information and respectful dialogue."
