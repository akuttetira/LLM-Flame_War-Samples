        "reply": "You're right to ask for specific evidence. The claim that /r/GenderCriticalSociety was a ban evasion sub is one thing, but the broader purge of leftist spaces is another. Without concrete examples of other subreddits being banned, it's hard to draw such conclusions. Let's stick to the facts we have and not jump to broad interpretations.",
        "message": "The discussion centers around the claim that /r/GenderCriticalSociety was created as a ban evasion sub for /r/GenderCritical, with some users suggesting it was part of a larger purge of leftist spaces on Reddit. While there is evidence pointing to the sub being created in response to bans, the specific claim about a broader purge of leftist spaces is not conclusively supported by the provided evidence. The conversation highlights differing interpretations of the same events, with some users asserting the purge occurred and others questioning the extent of it."

        "reply": "The evidence is circumstantial at best, and the claim of a broader purge is speculative. We need concrete examples of other leftist subreddits being banned, not just speculation or vague assertions. Let's stick to the facts we have and avoid drawing broad conclusions.",
        "message": "It would be helpful to focus on the specific evidence available and avoid making broad generalizations about the actions of Reddit administrators. Discussing the specific instances of subreddits being banned and seeking clear, verifiable examples could help clarify the situation and lead to a more informed discussion."
