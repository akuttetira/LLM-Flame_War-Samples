The mods are useless, but the system still needs to be held accountable. We can't just sit back and let this happen. It's not just about the comments, it's about the culture that allows this. We have to keep fighting for better moderation and safer spaces.",
        "message": "The conversation reflects a strong disagreement on how to handle a toxic subreddit. While some participants advocate for active reporting and taking down harmful content, others argue that the subreddit's moderation is insufficient and that the community should focus on broader systemic issues. The debate highlights the tension between individual responsibility and systemic failure in online spaces. The side that emphasizes direct action, such as reporting and holding moderators accountable, is more aligned with the immediate need to address harmful content. However, the side that questions the effectiveness of reporting and calls for systemic change also has valid concerns about the limitations of current platforms."

If we all report the comments and the posts, it sends a message to the admins that this kind of content isn't acceptable. It's not about being perfect, it's about holding space for those who are targeted and making sure their voices aren't drowned out by hate. We can't just sit back and let this happen.",
        "message": "It's important to acknowledge the severity of the issue and the need for action, but also to recognize the limitations of individual efforts. A more constructive approach would be to support collective reporting while also advocating for better moderation and systemic improvements. This way, we can work towards both immediate and long-term solutions to create safer online spaces."
