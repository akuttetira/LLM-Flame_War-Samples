        "reply": "You're really going out of your way to assume that anyone who doesn't fit your narrow definition of 'nonbinary' is a fraud. That's not just ignorant, it's actively harmful. Identity isn't a performance, and trying to judge someone based on how they present themselves is the very kind of gatekeeping this subreddit is trying to eliminate. Let's stop pretending that everyone's 'supposed' to fit a certain mold.",
        "message": "The conversation highlights a complex and sensitive topic around identity and community dynamics. While the user 'krazysh0t' expresses concerns about misinformation and bad actors within the r/soyboys community, the response from 'OwnCauliflower' challenges the assumption that non-binary individuals are not genuine based on how they present themselves. The key issue is the potential for judgment and gatekeeping based on appearance or behavior, which can be harmful and exclusionary. The more valid perspective is that identity is personal and should not be judged solely on outward presentation, as this can lead to discrimination and misunderstanding. The subreddit's rule against flame wars and instigation also reflects a desire for a respectful and inclusive environment."

        "reply": "You're really pushing the 'spot the fake' narrative again. But let's be real, if you're not willing to listen or understand, you're just another person trying to impose your standards on others. Identity is personal, and trying to define who is 'real' is just another form of gatekeeping. Let's stop playing games and just respect each other's choices.",
        "message": "It's important to approach discussions about identity with empathy and respect for individual experiences. Assuming someone is not genuine based on how they present themselves can be harmful and exclusionary. Let's focus on understanding and supporting each other's identities without judgment, and work towards a more inclusive and respectful community."
