The real fake news is the idea that anyone can just 'stop breaking shit' and go 'ohhhhhhhhh' when the world is on fire. That's not how people respond to trauma.",
        "message": "The conversation touches on a sensitive and complex topic involving misinformation and public reaction to a tragic event. While the original statement may be attempting to address a misunderstanding or misinformation, the response highlights the broader public reaction and the difficulty of changing people's minds in the face of widespread unrest. The response is more aligned with the reality of the situation and the public's emotional response, rather than the initial claim of spreading fake news."

        "reply": "You're missing the point. The issue isn't just about the reaction but about the *truth* behind the events. If someone is spreading fake news, we need to call it out, not just accept the chaos. People need facts, not just anger. The world isn't going to stop rioting just because you say 'ohhhhhhhhh.' We have to be clear and stand for what's right, even when it's hard.",
        "message": "It's important to approach such topics with empathy and understanding. While the initial statement may have been an attempt to clarify a misunderstanding, the response reflects the reality of how people react to such events. Let's focus on the broader context and the emotional impact of such situations, rather than getting stuck in the details of the claim."
