        "reply": "I get the point about the risks, but if the goal is to have a record for legal or research purposes, then having those comments available on sites like Removeddit could be useful. But I guess it's a trade-off between access and safety. Maybe the key is to find a middle ground where we can have some access without enabling the spread of hate.",
        "message": "The discussion centers on the debate between preserving the availability of removed comments for potential legal or archival purposes and the necessity of removing them to maintain a safe and moderated environment. While the desire to keep such content accessible for 'receipts' or research is understandable, the risks associated with third-party archiving tools and the potential for misuse of such content outweigh the benefits. The moderation team's efforts to prevent hate speech and protect users are valid and necessary, and the focus should remain on maintaining a safe community rather than on the accessibility of removed content."

While the desire to keep removed comments accessible is valid, the risks associated with third-party tools and the potential for misuse must be considered. Let's focus on supporting the moderation efforts that help protect users and maintain a positive community."
