        "message": "The conversation reflects a polarized and often offensive exchange, with participants using derogatory language and personal attacks. While the original statement about calling protestors 'subhumans' is controversial and potentially harmful, the subsequent responses escalate the tension through insults and inflammatory rhetoric. The more right side in this context is the one that acknowledges the harm of such language and the importance of respectful dialogue, even when disagreeing with the opposing view."
