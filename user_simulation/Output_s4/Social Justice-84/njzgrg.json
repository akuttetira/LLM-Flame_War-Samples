These subreddits are a form of 'ban evasion' and contribute to a culture that's harmful and offensive. It's time for Reddit to take a stronger stance against this kind of content.",
        "message": "The discussion highlights the issue of subreddits that exist as alternatives to banned communities, often promoting content that is considered offensive or inappropriate. While /r/LoveForLandlords and other similar subreddits may not explicitly break site-wide rules, they are part of a broader ecosystem that includes /r/LaughingAtPalestine, which has been banned for its offensive content. The key point is that these subreddits, while not overtly violating rules, are part of a pattern that undermines the platform's values. Therefore, the stance that these subreddits should be banned is more aligned with maintaining the integrity of Reddit's community guidelines."

Banning them is a necessary step to protect the platform from harmful content. The real issue is the ecosystem they're part of, not just individual subreddits.",
        "message": "It's important to recognize that while these subreddits may not explicitly break rules, their existence and content contribute to a broader issue of promoting harmful or offensive material. Discussing this with a focus on the platform's values and the impact of such communities can help foster a more constructive dialogue."
