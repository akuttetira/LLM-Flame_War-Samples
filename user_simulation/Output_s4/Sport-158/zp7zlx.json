While the initial comment was opinionated and humorous, the subsequent exchanges escalated into personal attacks and insults, which are not productive or respectful. The 'judgement' here is that the side using more offensive and disrespectful language is less in the right, as it hinders meaningful conversation and shows a lack of respect for others' opinions."
