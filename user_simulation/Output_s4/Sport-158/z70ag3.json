        "reply": "You're right, it's a bit of a double standard. If the rich and entitled trash the place, they should be held accountable, not the ones who clean up. But let's not forget that not everyone is a selfish asshole. There's a difference between being a good citizen and being a victim of entitlement. It's a complex issue, but I still think cleaning up is a positive thing, even if it's not always a reflection of the place's condition.",
        "message": "The conversation highlights a debate about responsibility and behavior in public spaces. While some argue that cleaning up after an event is a sign of good citizenship, others suggest that the act of cleaning does not necessarily imply the space was trashed. The discussion also touches on broader societal issues, such as entitlement and responsibility. The key point is that while cleaning up is a positive action, it should not be used as a justification for negative behavior. The side that emphasizes the importance of responsibility and the negative consequences of trashing public spaces is more in the right."

        "reply": "You're right, but the problem is that the majority of people don't see it that way. It's like saying 'I'll clean up after myself' but then expecting others to do the same. It's a cycle of entitlement and expectation. We need to break that cycle.",
        "message": "It's important to recognize that cleaning up after an event is a sign of respect and responsibility, but it shouldn't be used to excuse or justify negative behavior. Let's focus on the positive action of maintaining public spaces and the importance of holding everyone accountable for their actions, rather than turning the conversation into a debate about responsibility and entitlement."
