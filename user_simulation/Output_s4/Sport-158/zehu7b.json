        "message": "Zigzagnemesis presents a more balanced and evidence-based argument, acknowledging the absence of key players on both sides and predicting a likely outcome. Birdy_Stone and ShitPostQuokkaRome focus on France's weaknesses but overlook the potential strength of France with other key players on the field. The conversation could benefit from a more nuanced discussion of team dynamics and player availability."

        "reply": "You\u2019re right to point out the importance of team dynamics and overall strength. However, I still believe France has the edge with their depth and experience, even without those three key players. England\u2019s absence of Reece James is a significant disadvantage. I stand by my prediction of a 3-1 win for France, and I think the final is almost certain.",
        "message": "It would be helpful to consider the overall team strengths and how the absence of key players might affect the game. Let's explore both sides' arguments and try to find a more comprehensive view of the match."
