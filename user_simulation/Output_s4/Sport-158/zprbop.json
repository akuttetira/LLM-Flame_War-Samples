        "reply": "Yeah, but if your sport pays more, then it's objectively better. If you're gonna argue that soccer is better, you have to explain why it's better than the sports that actually pay more.",
        "message": "The debate centers on the relative popularity and financial success of soccer compared to American sports. While American sports like the NFL, MLB, and NBA do have higher average earnings for athletes, soccer has a global following and continues to grow in popularity and commercial value. The argument that soccer 'fades back into obscurity' in the U.S. is debatable, as soccer has a significant presence there. The key is recognizing that different regions and cultures value sports differently, and the financial success of a sport is not the only measure of its importance or appeal."

        "reply": "Yeah, but when it comes to actual money, American sports still hold the crown. Soccer might have a global fanbase, but when it comes to earning potential, it's still the American leagues that dominate. It's a numbers game, and the stats speak for themselves.",
        "message": "It's important to acknowledge that sports popularity and financial success can vary by region and culture. While American sports may have higher average earnings, soccer has a global following and continues to grow in popularity. Let's focus on the shared appreciation for the sport and its cultural impact rather than just financial metrics."
