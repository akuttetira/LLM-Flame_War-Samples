Just because you know someone doesn't mean you can judge their behavior. You're still being a dumbass. Go read a book or something.",
        "message": "The conversation has devolved into personal attacks and insults, with both sides engaging in disrespectful and inflammatory language. While the initial discussion about the referee's nationality and reputation may have had some merit, the subsequent exchange has become unproductive and harmful. The deleted comment provides some context about the referee's behavior, but the overall tone of the conversation has moved away from constructive dialogue."

You're the one who's been trying to shut everyone else up. Let's just talk about the referee and not about who's smarter or not.",
        "message": "It would be better to focus on the original topic of the referee's behavior and reputation without resorting to personal insults or attacks. Let's try to keep the conversation respectful and focused on the facts rather than personal opinions or provocations."
