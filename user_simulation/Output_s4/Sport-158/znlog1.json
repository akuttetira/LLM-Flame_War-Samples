        "reply": "You're still missing the point. The fact that you're trying to reframe it as a 'boot landing' shows how much you're trying to ignore the reality. The incident was a deliberate act, and the Mexican players know it. They're not being sensitive, they're being pragmatic. You're just trying to make it a 'fact' when it's clearly a matter of interpretation and context.",
        "message": "Danownage's statements are factually incorrect and misrepresent the incident. The act described was not a deliberate kick but rather a boot landing on the jersey, and Mexican players have publicly stated that it does not matter. The incident is not a matter of 'facts' but of context and interpretation."

I'm not trying to make a big deal out of it, but I think it's worth noting that the incident is more about the context than the facts.",
        "message": "It's important to approach such topics with nuance and respect for the context and perspectives of all parties involved. Let's focus on the broader implications of the incident rather than getting caught up in the details. Open dialogue and understanding can help bridge any gaps in interpretation."
