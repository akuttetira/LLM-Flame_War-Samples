        "reply": "I think the key is context. Pele was a legend, but this player is in a different era with different expectations. His confidence is a reflection of his achievements, not just ego. The criticism often comes from people who don't understand the scale of his success or the compensation he receives. It's a matter of perspective, and I think he's justified in feeling that way.",
        "message": "The conversation reflects a range of opinions about a player's self-perception and the expectations placed on him due to his high salary. While some critics argue that his confidence is excessive or ego-driven, others acknowledge his talent and the justification for his self-assurance given his level of success and compensation. The debate is nuanced, with valid points on both sides regarding the balance between humility and self-worth in high-profile sports figures."

        "reply": "I agree, it's a matter of perspective. Some people see his confidence as arrogance, but others see it as a well-earned right given his talent and the money he's making. It's a tricky balance, but I think he's justified in feeling that way. The key is how he uses that confidence - if he's using it to uplift the team and his fans, then it's fine. If he's just showing off, then it's a problem. But I think he's in the latter category, which is why some people find him annoying.",
        "message": "It's important to recognize that athletes at this level often face immense pressure and scrutiny. While some may feel their confidence is overblown, others see it as a natural response to their achievements. A more balanced discussion could explore the expectations placed on athletes, the role of media and public perception, and how success and self-worth are viewed in high-stakes environments."
