        "reply": "You're trying to make a point about identity and heritage, but you're missing the bigger picture. Mbapp\u00e9 is a French national, and that's what matters in sports. You can't just say someone is 'African' and expect them to be judged by that. It's about where you play and who you represent. Also, your comment about 'white privilege' is a bit out of place here. Let's focus on the game and the talent, not the politics of identity.",
        "message": "The conversation contains opinions that are emotionally charged and based on stereotypes. While it is important to acknowledge the complexity of identity and heritage, the discussion can be seen as more aligned with the perspective that individuals should be judged by their actions and contributions rather than by racial or ethnic background. The argument that Mbapp\u00e9 and other players should be considered French because they represent France is more in line with the principle of national identity and sports representation."

Mbapp\u00e9 represents France, and that's what matters in sports. Let's not get bogged down in stereotypes or political correctness. Focus on the game and the talent on display.",
        "message": "It's important to focus on the achievements and contributions of individuals rather than making generalizations about their heritage.
