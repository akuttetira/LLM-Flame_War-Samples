It's a great play, but it's not a magic trick. Just a well-executed move in a game that's full of them. Let's not make everything about the adjectives.",
        "message": "Both sides have valid points. RocketPengu1n is correct in questioning the overuse of adjectives like 'incredible' and highlighting the simplicity of the goal, while Noblesse101 and others emphasize the difficulty of the play, especially considering Messi's age and the context of the match. The goal is impressive, but it's also important to recognize the context and effort behind it."

        "reply": "You're right, it's football, not a coding challenge. But I still think the goal was more about the setup than the execution. The run was there, the pass was there, but it's still not a masterpiece. Just a great goal, not an incredible one. Let's not overhyperventilate over every single moment.",
        "message": "Let's appreciate the effort and context behind the goal while also being mindful of how we use adjectives. It's a great moment in football, and it's worth celebrating the skill and difficulty involved, even if it seems simple at first glance."
