The original post was about a family member, not a romantic partner, so the discussion around public affection should be adjusted accordingly.

        "message": "The conversation touches on cultural norms and public behavior, with some participants misinterpreting the context of the original post. The key point is that the original post was about a family member (mother) and not a romantic partner, which clarifies the appropriateness of the gesture. The more accurate interpretation is that public affection between family members is generally accepted in many cultures, while public romantic displays may be restricted in some regions. The debate around what is 'legal' or 'acceptable' in Qatar is nuanced and depends on context."
