The real issue is the coach's behavior, not the Croatian reporters. But hey, if you're going to troll, at least do it with some style.",
        "message": "The conversation contains heated and opinionated remarks, with some users expressing strong personal opinions about a coach's behavior and the actions of Croatian players. While the discussion is focused on a specific event, it includes personal attacks and accusations that are not based on verified facts. The user who accused the Croatian reporter of eavesdropping and the subsequent counter-accusations reflect a polarized and emotionally charged debate, which can be seen as biased and unconstructive."

        "message": "It would be more constructive to focus on the specific event and the context of the press conference, rather than making personal attacks or spreading unverified claims. Discussing the event with a balanced perspective and factual information would help foster a more productive conversation."
