The issue is that people are still reacting to it, which shows how much it's stuck in the minds of fans. I think the real problem is that the action was so bizarre, it's hard to forget.",
        "message": "The discussion revolves around a controversial football moment involving Neuer and Higuain. While some argue that the play was a foul, others believe it was a clean action. The debate highlights differing interpretations of the rules and the context of the game. The key point is that the action was controversial, but the exact nature of the foul, if any, is subject to interpretation. The debate is opinionated, and both sides have valid points based on different perspectives."

The important thing is to respect the game and the players, and not let the controversy overshadow the sport itself.",
