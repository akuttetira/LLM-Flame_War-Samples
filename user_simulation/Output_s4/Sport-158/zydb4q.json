Celebrating his life is the right approach, and I'm not the one being insensitive. If you're feeling that way, maybe it's because you're not as familiar with his legacy as you think.",
        "message": "FactAndLogic's perspective is more in line with the gravity of the situation. While they make light of Pel\u00e9's death, their argument about celebrating his life rather than mourning is more in line with the spirit of honoring a legend. However, their dismissive attitude towards the emotional impact of Pel\u00e9's death and their use of humor in a solemn context are also questionable."

He was a legend, and we should honor him by remembering his achievements and the impact he had on the world. Let's not waste time on trivialities or personal attacks. Focus on the positive and celebrate his legacy.",

While it's okay to have a light-hearted perspective, it's also important to show respect for the person and their impact on the world. Let's focus on celebrating his life and legacy rather than making light of his death."
