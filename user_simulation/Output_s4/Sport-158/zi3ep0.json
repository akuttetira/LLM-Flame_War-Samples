It's great when people like TrashSmells bring up the timeline issues, and it's also good to have tips like /s for jokes. Let's make sure we're all on the same page with the actual events, not just speculation or humor.",
        "message": "YoMySlime's prediction is speculative and not based on current information, while TrashSmells correctly points out the timeline inconsistency. Suspicious-seal provides a helpful tip on joke formatting, but the main issue is the accuracy of the prediction. TrashSmells is more in the right with the timeline clarification."
