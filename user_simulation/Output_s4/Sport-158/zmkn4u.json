        "message": "The original comment by blueboy022020 was a joke, and the response by Duckway767 and redwarewolf correctly pointed out that it was not Messi's actual grandma. The comment was not meant to be taken seriously, and the humor was in the exaggeration. The comment about Brazil was a joke as well, and the deletion of the comment by the user indicates that it was understood to be a joke. The overall context shows that the conversation was light-hearted and not meant to be taken as a serious accusation."

Let's keep the tone light and focus on the joke rather than taking it as a serious accusation.
