        "reply": "I agree that the term 'big team' is subjective, but Uruguay's recent performance has been lackluster. They've struggled to qualify consistently and have had a hard time progressing in tournaments. Even with their historical legacy, it's clear they're not the dominant force they once were. The 2018 match was a big controversy, but that doesn't change the fact that Uruguay is now a team that's on the fringes of the big teams. They need to rebuild and show consistency if they want to be considered a true powerhouse again.",
        "message": "The discussion highlights differing perspectives on Uruguay's status as a 'big team.' While some argue Uruguay's historical achievements and past performances place them in a higher tier, others point to their recent performance and lack of consistent success as evidence of them being a 'fringe mediocre' team. The debate also touches on the controversy of the 2018 World Cup match between Uruguay and Ghana, with opinions varying on whether the match was fair or not. Ultimately, the 'big team' designation is subjective and depends on the criteria used (historical legacy, recent performance, or other factors)."

        "reply": "I agree that the 'big team' designation is subjective, but Uruguay's recent performance and lack of consistent success do raise questions about their current standing. The 2018 match controversy also highlights how even a historically strong team can face challenges. It's clear that while Uruguay has a rich history, their current form and consistency may not align with that perception. The debate shows how much the term 'big team' can be influenced by different criteria and perspectives.",
        "message": "It's important to recognize that the term 'big team' is not universally defined and can be interpreted in different ways. While Uruguay has a rich history and has been a strong team in the past, their recent performance and consistency may not align with that perception. The controversy around the 2018 match also shows that even strong teams can face challenges. To move forward, it might be helpful to focus on specific criteria, such as historical achievements, recent performance, or other relevant factors, to better understand and discuss the topic."
