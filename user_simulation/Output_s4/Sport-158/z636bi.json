And I'm not even saying it's racist, I'm just saying it's not an upset. I'm not trying to be rude, I'm just trying to understand.",
        "message": "The discussion revolves around the definition of 'upset' in sports, with some users interpreting it as a negative term related to racism, while others explain it as an unexpected result. The key point is that 'upset' in this context refers to an unexpected outcome, not a negative judgment. The user 'Motor-Ad-3051' appears to be misinterpreting the term and using it to express a preference for non-European teams, which can be seen as racially biased. The majority of the conversation clarifies that an upset is simply an unexpected result, not a value judgment. Therefore, the side that correctly explains the term and acknowledges that an upset is not inherently negative is more in the right."

Morocco is a team from a different part of the world, and they beat a team that's been dominating the World Cup for decades. It's not just an upset, it's a statement. I'm proud of them.",
        "message": "It's important to recognize that the term 'upset' in sports simply means an unexpected result, not a negative judgment. While it's valid to support underdog teams, it's also important to understand the context and avoid using terms that may be perceived as racially biased. Let's focus on the game itself and the unexpected nature of the result, rather than personal opinions or misunderstandings about the term 'upset.'"
