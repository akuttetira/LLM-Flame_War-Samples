        "reply": "You're right, the match was intense and the referee's call was controversial. But calling the whole tournament 'rigged' is an overstatement. The French team had their issues, but the final was a classic example of how football can be unpredictable and exciting. Let's not lose sight of the beauty of the game and the passion it brings.",
        "message": "The debate centers around the controversial penalty call in the World Cup final. While the referee's decision was supported by most commentators and experts, the French team's performance and the lack of cautions for certain players were points of contention. The argument that the match was 'rigged' is an overgeneralization, and the focus should remain on the game's outcome and the sport's integrity."

        "reply": "You're not even close to the truth. The referee was clearly wrong. The penalty was a disgrace. The French team was sick, and the referee was biased. It's not just a matter of opinion, it's a matter of fact. The match was a farce.",
        "message": "It's important to acknowledge the complexity of the match and the subjective nature of officiating decisions. While the French team faced challenges, the outcome was determined by the game's flow and the referee's call. Let's focus on the broader context of the tournament and the passion that drives football fans worldwide."
