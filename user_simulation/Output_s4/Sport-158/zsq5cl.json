        "reply": "Exactly, the GOAT is subjective. But if you're going to argue about it, at least do it with some facts and respect. Pele's three World Cups are undeniable, but Messi's era is different. It's like saying the best car is the one from 1950 because it has more wheels. Context matters.",
        "message": "The discussion revolves around the debate of who is the greatest of all time (GOAT) in football, with arguments focusing on Pele and Messi. While both players have achieved remarkable success, the conversation often veers into subjective and opinionated territory. Pele's three World Cup wins and his influence in the 1950s-1970s are valid points, but the modern era's context and Messi's achievements in the 21st century also deserve recognition. The debate is inherently subjective, and the conversation occasionally becomes dismissive or dismissive of valid counterpoints."

        "message": "It's important to recognize that the 'GOAT' debate is subjective and depends on personal preferences, era, and criteria. While Pele's three World Cup wins are significant, Messi's achievements in the modern era, including multiple Ballon d'Or awards and a World Cup victory, also warrant consideration. Let's focus on the merits of each player's contributions and avoid dismissive or overly opinionated statements to keep the conversation respectful and constructive."
