        "message": "The discussion around Pele's legacy versus other players like Messi is subjective and opinion-based. While MrHollandsOpium asserts Pele's supremacy, ILuvCatGirlsx challenges this view. The conversation reflects differing opinions on sports history and personal preferences, which is natural but can become divisive."

        "message": "It's important to respect differing opinions and acknowledge that evaluating sports legends is inherently subjective. Let's focus on celebrating Pele's contributions and the rich history of football rather than engaging in a debate that may not be productive for everyone."
