        "reply": "I'm not trying to be mean, but you're clearly not getting the point. The more teams you have, the more dead rubbers there are. The new format is a disaster for the competition's appeal and the quality of matches. You can't just say 'I agree with you' and then act like you understand the issue. It's simple math: more teams = more games that don't matter.",
        "message": "The discussion centers around the debate over the new UEFA Champions League format, with some arguing that it dilutes the competition's appeal by increasing the number of teams and resulting in more 'dead rubbers' (meaningless matches), while others believe the format still offers enough competitive value and financial incentives to keep the tournament engaging. Both sides present valid points, but the argument from the perspective of the fans and the impact on the quality of matches is more nuanced. The concern about reduced competitiveness and motivation among teams is a significant point, but the counter-argument about financial incentives and the potential for more exciting matchups also holds merit. Therefore, the side that emphasizes the potential for more competitive and exciting matches, while acknowledging the concerns about dead rubbers, is more balanced in its reasoning."

        "reply": "You're right, I was a bit harsh. But I still stand by the fact that more teams in the single league format lead to more dead rubbers, which dilute the competition's appeal. The financial incentives are important, but they don't outweigh the fact that the tournament's core appeal - the excitement and competitiveness - is being undermined. The new format is a step in the wrong direction.",
        "message": "It would be helpful to focus on the broader implications of the format change, such as how it affects the overall competitiveness of the tournament, the fan experience, and the financial incentives for teams. Both perspectives have value, and finding a middle ground that acknowledges the concerns about dead rubbers while also considering the potential for more matches and opportunities for teams to perform well could lead to a more constructive conversation."
