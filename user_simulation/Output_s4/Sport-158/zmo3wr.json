The 'Hand of God' was a moment of human error in an era where such things were more likely, but today, with better equipment and rules, those moments are less common. Still, the emotional impact of such goals remains, showing that while the mechanics of the game have evolved, the human element of sports is still deeply felt.",
        "message": "Both perspectives have merit. The idea that underdog teams sometimes win is a common theme in sports, and the 'Hand of God' goal in 2022 is a famous example. However, the argument about the impossibility of such a goal in modern, high-definition matches is also valid, as technology has made such incidents less likely. The debate reflects the complexity of sports outcomes and the role of both human error and technological advancement."
