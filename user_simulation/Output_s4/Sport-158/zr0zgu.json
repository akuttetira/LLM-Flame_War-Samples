It's not necessarily a sign of cheating, but more of a strategic move by companies to capitalize on the event. I guess it's just a matter of perspective\u2014some people see it as manipulation, others as smart marketing.",
        "message": "The conversation reflects a range of opinions, with some users expressing frustration over the speed of the advertisement and others suggesting that the ad might have been pre-planned based on expected outcomes. While the frustration is valid, the suggestion that companies might have pre-planned the ad based on results is a more balanced and plausible explanation, common in sports marketing."

        "reply": "You're right, the ad could have been pre-planned based on expected outcomes. But let's not forget that the World Cup is a massive event, and companies often have months to plan such campaigns. The speed at which the ad was released might just be a coincidence, or maybe they were just trying to capitalize on the momentum of Messi's win. It's not necessarily a sign of rigging, just a smart business move.",
        "message": "It's understandable to feel frustrated when things happen too quickly, but it's also important to consider the broader context of how companies often plan marketing strategies around major events. Let's try to approach this with a bit more understanding and open-mindedness."
