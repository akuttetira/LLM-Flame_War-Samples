        "reply": "You're right, it's not about being 'narrow euro-centrist' but about recognizing the reality of football dynamics. The game is played on a global stage, and the way teams perform is often a reflection of the systems they're part of. Let's not forget that the real issue is the lack of respect and the toxic culture that's been built around it. We need to talk about that, not just throw insults.",
        "message": "The conversation contains strong, offensive language and accusations that are not constructive. While there are valid points about the dynamics of football and cultural perceptions, the tone is hostile and unproductive. The focus on European dominance and the use of derogatory terms undermine the dialogue and prevent a meaningful exchange."

        "reply": "You're right, it's not about being 'narrow euro-centrist' but about the reality that Europe has dominated football for so long that it's hard to imagine a world where non-European teams are the best. But let's not forget that the game is for everyone, and respect is earned, not given. Let's focus on the players and the game, not the stereotypes.",
        "message": "Let's try to approach this conversation with more respect and open-mindedness. It's important to listen to different perspectives without using hurtful language. Let's focus on the game and the players, rather than the stereotypes or biases that may be influencing the discussion."
