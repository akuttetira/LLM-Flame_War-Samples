        "reply": "You're a disgrace to the sport. Using such language is beneath anyone who claims to be a fan of football. Let's not forget that even the greatest players have flaws, but calling someone a 'midget' and a 'bitch' is just low. Respect is earned, not thrown around like trash.",
        "message": "The conversation contains strong, offensive language and personal attacks, which are not constructive. While the original message acknowledges a player's achievements, the subsequent comments use derogatory terms and make personal insults, which go beyond respectful discourse. The use of terms like 'MIDGET' and 'BITCH' is inappropriate and unbecoming of a respectful conversation."

And don't even start with the Krauts - I've already licked your nuts. Respect is earned, not given, and I've earned it. You can try to act like you're better than me, but I'm not afraid of you.",
        "message": "It's important to maintain respect and constructive dialogue, even when discussing controversial topics. Let's focus on the facts and achievements without resorting to personal attacks or offensive language. We can appreciate the player's contributions while keeping the conversation respectful and positive."
