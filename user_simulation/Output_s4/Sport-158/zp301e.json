        "reply": "You're both wrong. The rule about staying on the field after leaving is a myth. The real rule is that if a player leaves the field, the game resumes with a kickoff from the spot where the player left. The 'staying on the field' rule doesn't exist. I'm not going to take your facts and call them 'cunt' just because you're trying to be factual. But I'm also not going to back down from my anger just because you're trying to be right.",
        "message": "The user 'WORMH01E' expresses strong frustration, which is valid given the context. However, the user '[deleted]' provides a factual explanation about soccer rules, which is more accurate and relevant to the situation. The user 'fall1n1gr' correctly points out that the rule mentioned does not exist, which helps clarify the misunderstanding. Therefore, the side that provides factual and rule-based information is more in the right."

        "message": "It's important to stay calm and focus on the actual rules of the game when discussing such situations. Let's try to clarify the rules and facts to better understand what's happening, rather than focusing on emotional reactions."
