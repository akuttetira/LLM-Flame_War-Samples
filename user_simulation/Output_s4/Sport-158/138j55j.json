        "reply": "You're missing the point. The pain of losing to a stronger team in a high-stakes match like the World Cup final is real and emotional. It's not just about winning the cup, it's about the moment you're beaten by a team that's clearly better. And yes, the 2018 game with Mbappe was a huge part of that. I'm not saying it's the worst, but it's definitely a big part of the pain.",
        "message": "The conversation revolves around the emotional impact of specific football matches on Argentina and Mexico. While both sides present valid points about the significance of these games, the argument about the relative pain of losing in the World Cup final versus a regular match is more nuanced. The discussion highlights the emotional weight of losing to a stronger team, especially in high-stakes moments like the World Cup, which is more impactful than a regular match. However, the debate about whether the 2018 or 2022 matches were more traumatic is subjective and depends on personal experience and perspective."

        "reply": "You're missing the point. The pain of losing to a team that's actually better than you, especially in a high-stakes match like the World Cup final, is different from losing in a regular game. It's not just about winning the World Cup; it's about the emotional toll of being beaten by a stronger team in the most important match of the tournament. That's why the 2018 game still haunts people, not because we lost the World Cup, but because we were so close and then lost to a team that was clearly better. It's a different kind of pain, and I'm not willing to let that go just because you think it's not that big of a deal.",
        "message": "It's understandable to feel passionate about these moments, but it's also important to acknowledge that the emotional impact of a match can vary based on individual experiences and the context of the game. Let's focus on the shared excitement and pride of football, and how these moments contribute to the broader story of the sport. Open-mindedness and respect for different perspectives can help us appreciate the game more fully."
