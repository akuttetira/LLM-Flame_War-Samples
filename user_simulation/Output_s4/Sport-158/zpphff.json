But I also care about being respectful and not letting my opinions turn into personal attacks. I'm not a child, and I don't scream like one. If you have something constructive to say about the game, say it. If not, maybe just shut up and let me have my own opinion.",
        "message": "The conversation involves a mix of opinionated commentary about a soccer player's performance and a personal attack on the user's behavior and character. While the initial comment about Di Maria's performance is a valid opinion, the subsequent comments become increasingly personal and disrespectful, using derogatory language and making unfounded assumptions about the user's character. The user's response also includes a personal attack on the other commenter, which is not constructive. The conversation has moved from a discussion of sports to a personal conflict, which is not productive."

But I also care about being respectful and not letting my opinion turn into a personal attack. I'll stick to the facts and not let my frustration get the best of me. Let's keep the conversation about the game, not about who's a real man or not.",
        "message": "It would be more constructive to focus on the sports discussion and avoid personal attacks or derogatory language. If you have a comment or opinion about the soccer player's performance, feel free to share it, but let's keep the conversation respectful and focused on the topic at hand. If you have any other comments or questions, I'd be happy to help."
