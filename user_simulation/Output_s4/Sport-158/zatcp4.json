        "reply": "I think the deleted comment is missing the point. The question is about Portugal's results, not Manchester United's. Ronaldo's absence could have impacted Portugal's performance, but the deleted comment is focusing on other players, which is a distraction. Ten Hag's decision was likely based on team strategy, not just individual performance. The real issue is whether Ronaldo's absence was the right call for Portugal's team dynamics.",
        "message": "The conversation revolves around the debate over whether Ten Hag made the correct decision to bench Ronaldo during the group stage. While the user questions the impact of Ronaldo's absence on Portugal's results, the deleted comment suggests a perspective that focuses on the performance of other Manchester United players. The key issue is whether the decision to bench Ronaldo was justified based on team strategy or individual performance. The user's question is valid, but the deleted comment shifts the focus to a different aspect of the situation, which may not directly address the original concern. The user's perspective is more aligned with the original question, but the deleted comment introduces a different viewpoint that requires consideration."

        "reply": "I think the deleted comment misses the point. The question is about whether Ten Hag was wrong to bench Ronaldo, not about other players' performance. Portugal's results without Ronaldo are a separate issue. The key is whether Ten Hag's decision was strategic, not about other players' form. Ronaldo's impact is undeniable, so benching him was a risky move.",
        "message": "It's important to acknowledge that both perspectives have merit. The user's question is valid in exploring the impact of Ronaldo's absence on Portugal's performance, while the deleted comment raises a valid point about the performance of other players. To move forward constructively, it might be helpful to discuss the context of the match, the tactical decisions made by Ten Hag, and the broader implications of Ronaldo's role in the team. This would allow for a more balanced and informed discussion."
