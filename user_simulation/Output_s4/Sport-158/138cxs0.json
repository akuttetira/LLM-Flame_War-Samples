        "reply": "You're right, his achievements are undeniable, but that doesn't excuse his trashy behavior. Even if he's a great player, calling a 20-year-old 'dickface' is just low. And don't get me started on the UCL thing. It's not about being irrelevant, it's about being a classless piece of work. Barca fans are just as guilty of being biased, but at least they don't throw around stats like that.",
        "message": "The conversation reflects a polarized debate about Sergio Ag\u00fcero's conduct and legacy. While some users criticize Ag\u00fcero for his behavior, others highlight his achievements and contributions to Manchester City. The debate is opinionated and often emotionally charged, with some users making personal attacks and others defending Ag\u00fcero's actions with factual data. The key issue is whether Ag\u00fcero's actions are indicative of a broader personality flaw or a result of specific circumstances. The argument that Ag\u00fcero is 'irrelevant' after 2012 is not supported by the evidence of his long-term contributions to the club and his record in the Premier League. However, the criticism of his behavior, such as calling a younger player 'dickface,' is valid and reflects a concern about his conduct on and off the pitch. The debate is complex and multifaceted, with both sides presenting valid points based on different perspectives."

        "reply": "I think the issue is that people are trying to make a case for Ag\u00fcero's behavior as a reflection of his character, but it's really just a momentary reaction. He's been a key player for City for over a decade, and his stats speak for themselves. The fact that he called a 20-year-old 'dickface' is a problem, but that's just one incident. People are quick to judge him without considering the context. Also, the whole 'he's irrelevant after 2012' thing is just not true. He's been a consistent performer and has helped City win multiple titles. It's a shame that some people can't see the bigger picture.",
        "message": "It would be helpful to focus on the broader context of Ag\u00fcero's career and contributions to Manchester City, rather than personal attacks or subjective opinions. While it's valid to critique his behavior, it's also important to acknowledge his achievements and the impact he has had on the club. A more balanced discussion would consider both his on-field contributions and his conduct, and avoid generalizations or inflammatory language. This would help foster a more constructive and respectful dialogue about his legacy."
