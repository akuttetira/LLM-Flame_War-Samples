        "reply": "The problem is that people are trying to shift the focus back to the victim's mental health, which is a classic case of victim-blaming. The fact that she had to self-harm to get time off is a clear indication of the toxic environment she was in. The company's response was not only inappropriate but also harmful. The real issue is the company's failure to provide a safe and respectful work environment, not the victim's mental health. We need to hold the company accountable, not the victim.",
        "message": "The conversation reflects a complex and sensitive issue surrounding workplace abuse and mental health. While the incident involving Maddison is serious and the actions of LTT management are clearly inappropriate, the discussion often veers into victim-blaming and dismissive attitudes. The key is to acknowledge the severity of the workplace abuse and the impact it has on mental health, while also recognizing the need for a balanced and evidence-based approach. The responsibility of the employer in ensuring a safe and respectful work environment is clear, and the response should focus on supporting the victim and holding the employer accountable."

        "reply": "You're absolutely right - the conversation is full of victim-blaming and dismissive attitudes. The key is to hold employers accountable for creating a safe work environment, not to question the mental health of the victim. The focus should be on the actions of the employer and the need for proper support and investigation, rather than on the victim's behavior or mental state. Let's work towards a more supportive and informed discussion.",
        "message": "It is important to approach this topic with empathy and understanding. While it is crucial to hold employers accountable for creating a safe work environment, it is equally important to avoid making assumptions about the victim's mental health or character. The focus should be on the actions of the employer and the need for proper support and investigation, rather than on the victim's behavior or mental state. Let's work towards a more supportive and informed discussion."
