        "reply": "You're right, the comparison is a bit slippery. Facebook's API was definitely more lenient in the past, but the key difference is that Reddit's API changes have been more abrupt and controversial. The issue isn't just about pricing, but also about how Reddit has handled the transition and communication with developers. It's a delicate balance between generating revenue and maintaining a community that relies on third-party apps. The real question is whether Reddit can find a sustainable model that works for both the platform and its developers without alienating the community.",
        "message": "The conversation highlights differing perspectives on API access and platform business models. While some argue that platforms like Facebook and Twitter have historically allowed free API access, others point out that this has changed in recent years, particularly with Reddit's API policies. The debate centers around the fairness of paid API models, the impact on third-party developers, and the long-term sustainability of such business models. While the claim that platforms like Facebook allowed free API access is partially true, the comparison to Reddit's approach is more nuanced. Reddit's API changes have been controversial, and the discussion reflects a broader tension between platform control and developer autonomy."

        "reply": "You're right, the comparison is a bit slippery. But the key point is that Reddit's API changes are a specific case of a broader issue: platforms that once allowed free API access are now shifting to paid models, which can be problematic for third-party developers. The issue isn't just about whether a platform allowed free access in the past, but how they're handling it now and the impact on the community. Reddit's approach has been controversial, and it's a reminder that the balance between platform control and developer autonomy is delicate. It's not just about the API itself, but the business model and how it affects the ecosystem.",
        "message": "It would be helpful to focus on the specific changes Reddit has made to its API policies and the impact on third-party developers, rather than generalizing across all platforms. Also, it would be beneficial to consider the long-term implications of these changes for both the platform and its community. Engaging in a more structured discussion about the trade-offs of different business models could help clarify the issues at hand and lead to a more informed conversation."
