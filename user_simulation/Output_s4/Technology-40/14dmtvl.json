        "reply": "The EU is trying to force a design compromise that doesn't serve the average consumer. They want to make phones more repairable, but at the cost of water resistance and slim profiles. This is a classic case of government overreach into product design, and it's not solving the real problem of battery degradation. The real solution is to let consumers choose, not dictate what they can and cannot do with their devices.",
        "message": "The debate centers around the balance between consumer choice, environmental sustainability, and product design. While some argue that the free market should allow companies to prioritize design features like water resistance and slim profiles, others emphasize the importance of repairability and recycling. The EU regulation aims to promote sustainability by making devices more repairable, which aligns with broader environmental goals. However, the regulation also raises concerns about potential trade-offs in design and consumer choice. The key issue is whether the benefits of increased repairability and sustainability outweigh the potential drawbacks in design and cost. Ultimately, the regulation reflects a growing global focus on sustainability and consumer rights, but its implementation will depend on how it is balanced with practical design considerations."

        "reply": "The EU is trying to force a design compromise that will ultimately make phones bulkier and less durable. The real issue is that companies like Apple are not being held accountable for their design choices. Instead of mandating battery replacements, the EU should focus on enforcing strict environmental standards and holding companies responsible for the lifespan of their products. This regulation is a step in the right direction, but it's not going to solve the real problems of consumer choice and product longevity.",
        "message": "It's important to recognize that both perspectives have valid points. The free market allows for diverse product designs, but there's also a growing emphasis on sustainability and consumer rights. The EU regulation is an effort to promote sustainability by making devices more repairable, which can help reduce electronic waste. However, it's also important to consider the practical implications of such regulations on product design and consumer choice. By focusing on the shared goal of sustainability and consumer rights, we can work towards a solution that balances these considerations."
