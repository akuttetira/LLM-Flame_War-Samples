        "message": "The user expresses frustration about a comment disappearing, which may indicate a technical issue or a policy enforcement action. While the user's concern is valid, the language used ('disgusting behaviour', 'shambles of a company') can be seen as overly critical and not constructive. The situation may require a more neutral and factual approach to address the issue without escalating tension."

Let's try to address it calmly instead of calling the company a 'shambles' and using extreme language. We can all be more constructive here.",
        "message": "It might be helpful to approach the situation with a more neutral tone, focusing on the technical or policy aspects rather than emotional language. This can help in getting a more objective response and resolving the issue more effectively."
