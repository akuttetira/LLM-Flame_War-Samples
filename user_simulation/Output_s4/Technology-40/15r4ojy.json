        "reply": "I completely agree. The damage done to Billet Labs by LTT's negligence is significant, and while the compensation is a start, it's not enough. The real issue is the lack of proper handling and testing of the prototype, which could have been avoided with better procedures. The community's support is a blessing, but it's crucial that LTT takes full responsibility and works to rebuild trust with Billet Labs.",
        "message": "The situation involving Billet Labs and Linus Tech Tips (LTT) is complex, with valid points from both sides. While LTT's actions were clearly negligent and unprofessional, leading to the loss of a prototype and a poorly reviewed product, Billet Labs' response has been commendable in terms of maintaining dignity and leveraging the situation for positive exposure. The key issue is the negligence and lack of proper handling by LTT, which caused significant harm to Billet Labs. However, the community's support for Billet Labs has also been a positive outcome, highlighting the importance of ethical behavior in media and review practices."
