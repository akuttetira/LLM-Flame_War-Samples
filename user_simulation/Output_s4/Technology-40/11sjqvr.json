While it's easy to form opinions based on limited information, it's crucial to consider the context and potential biases. Linus has shown care for Brandon, and it's possible that he has similar feelings for others. The key is to distinguish between personal accounts and verified facts, and to be respectful of everyone involved in the conversation.",

Linus has shown care for Brandon, and it's possible that he has similar feelings for others. The key is to look at the context and not jump to conclusions based on limited information. We should also be cautious about spreading unverified stories, as they can be misleading. It's always better to give people the benefit of the doubt and consider multiple perspectives before making judgments.",
