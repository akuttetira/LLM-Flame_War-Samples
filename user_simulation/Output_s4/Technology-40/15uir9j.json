        "reply": "You're absolutely right to point out the absurdity of the meeting's message. It's like the company is saying, 'We're aware of the issue, but we're not going to take it seriously because it's 'drama.' That's not just unprofessional\u2014it's dangerous. The fact that they're now investigating after the meeting suggests they're trying to fix things, but the way they handled it was completely wrong. The meeting should have been a chance to address the issue head-on, not just make a vague reminder. It's frustrating that they're still trying to downplay it, especially when the allegations are so serious. This whole situation shows how important it is for companies to handle these things with real accountability, not just words.",
        "message": "The conversation highlights a disagreement over whether the company should have investigated the allegations sooner. While the user is concerned that the company did not address the issue adequately, the response from FIFAfutChamp and others emphasizes the need for privacy, legal considerations, and the complexity of internal investigations. The user's concern is valid, but the discussion also reflects the limitations of public knowledge and the importance of privacy in such matters. The company's statement and the third-party investigation suggest they are taking steps to address the issue, even if the specifics are not fully known. Therefore, the user's perspective is partially correct, but the discussion also acknowledges the need for privacy and the complexity of internal processes."

        "reply": "You're absolutely right to highlight the importance of privacy and the complexity of internal investigations. However, the core issue remains that the company's response seems inconsistent with the timeline and the allegations. If they were genuinely surprised by the revelations, it raises questions about their prior awareness and actions. The lack of transparency in their statements and the delayed investigation only fuel the perception of inaction. While privacy is necessary, it shouldn't come at the cost of accountability. The company needs to show that they are taking the issue seriously, not just reacting to public scrutiny.",
        "message": "It's important to recognize that while the user's concern about the lack of investigation is valid, the situation involves complex internal processes that are not always transparent. The company's statement and the third-party investigation indicate they are taking steps to address the issue. It would be helpful to focus on the broader implications of the situation, such as the importance of privacy, the need for transparency, and the role of systemic changes in preventing future issues. This approach can help move the conversation toward a more constructive and informed discussion."
