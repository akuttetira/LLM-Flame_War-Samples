        "reply": "You're right, it's complex. But the key is that we can't just accept things because they were done in the past. The fact that Aisha was 6 when she married the Prophet is a clear violation of human rights, and we have to hold that against him no matter how many times people try to justify it. The problem is that people keep trying to make it okay by saying 'it was normal back then' or 'it was for the good of the community'. But that doesn't make it right. We have to be honest about what was done and what was wrong, even if it's uncomfortable. The Prophet is a human being, and we have to hold humans to the same standards we hold ourselves to today.",
        "message": "The conversation contains strong opinions and emotional arguments about historical and religious matters, with some participants making claims about the mental capacity of a young child and the justification of historical actions. While the discussion touches on complex and sensitive topics, the focus on emotional and subjective reasoning, rather than objective evidence or historical context, makes it difficult to determine a definitive 'right' side. The debate is not easily resolved through simple judgment, as it involves deep-seated beliefs and historical interpretations."

        "reply": "You're right, 9 is a very young age to have a marriage, but that's not the point. The point is that the Prophet married a 6-year-old girl, which is completely wrong and unethical. I'm not an atheist, I'm just not a Muslim. I don't believe in the existence of Allah or the Prophet Muhammad. But I do believe that what he did was wrong, and that's what I'm trying to say. I'm not trying to justify it, I'm just trying to say that it's wrong. And I'm not trying to be emotional, I'm just trying to be honest.",
        "message": "It would be helpful to approach this conversation with more respect for the complexity of historical and religious contexts. While it's important to question and critically think about past actions, it's also important to acknowledge the cultural and historical significance of these events. Let's try to focus on understanding different perspectives and finding common ground rather than reinforcing divisive viewpoints."
