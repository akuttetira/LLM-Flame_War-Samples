You can't have love and justice coexist if you're saying that God's judgment is inhumane. If He's loving, He wouldn't send anyone to hell. If He's just, He would. The problem is you're using a human standard to judge God, which is impossible. He's not bound by our morals. He's the Author of morality. So, either He's not loving, or He's not just. But I don't think He's either. I think He's both. And that's why I believe in Jesus.",
        "message": "The conversation reflects a deeply held belief in the moral and theological framework of Christianity, particularly the doctrine of salvation through Jesus Christ and the judgment of souls based on faith. The participant 'chokingonaleftleg' argues that God's judgment is just and that good deeds do not mitigate the consequences of sin. The other participant, 'l00pee', challenges this view, asserting that God's actions are inhumane and that love, not judgment, should be the foundation of morality. While both sides present valid perspectives based on their beliefs, the core issue is the interpretation of divine justice and the moral standards by which God is judged. The 'chokingonaleftleg' perspective is rooted in religious doctrine, while the 'l00pee' perspective is grounded in a humanistic and empathetic moral framework."

        "reply": "You're right, love isn't just about being nice, it's about justice too. If God loved people, He wouldn't send them to hell for not believing in Jesus. But according to the Bible, that's what He does. So either the Bible is wrong, or God is not love. I'm not sure which is more sadistic.",
        "message": "It's important to recognize that both perspectives are based on different worldviews\u2014religious and philosophical. While the religious perspective emphasizes divine justice and the necessity of faith in Jesus for salvation, the humanistic perspective focuses on empathy, moral responsibility, and the inherent value of all human life. To move forward constructively, we can acknowledge the validity of both viewpoints and explore how they might coexist or complement each other in a way that respects the dignity of all people."
