        "reply": "I agree that the argument is more about the patterns in religions rather than the divine. But I still think the core issue is that the argument is not about proving religions false, but about showing they follow man-made patterns. The other responses often get sidetracked by assuming the divine has to behave in certain ways, which is not the point. The real point is that religions, no matter how divine they claim to be, still have human elements that make them look man-made.",
        "message": "The argument presented by BraveOmeter is more in line with the core claim that all religions follow man-made patterns, as it directly addresses the original point and provides a structured, logical response to the counterarguments. The other responses, while thoughtful, often conflate the original argument with additional assumptions about the nature of religion and the divine, which can obscure the main point. The discussion is largely opinionated, but the core argument is best defended by acknowledging the patterns in religions without making unfounded assumptions about the divine."

        "reply": "I agree that the argument is more about the patterns in religions rather than making assumptions about the divine. But the problem is that the original argument is still a bit vague. It's not clear what exactly is being argued, and the responses often assume the argument is about proving religions false, which it isn't. The key is to focus on the patterns without getting sidetracked into debates about the divine's capabilities or the nature of religious revelation.",
        "message": "It would be helpful to focus more on the original argument that all religions follow man-made patterns, and to avoid making assumptions about the divine or the nature of religious revelation. By keeping the discussion grounded in the patterns observed in religions, the conversation can remain more focused and productive."
