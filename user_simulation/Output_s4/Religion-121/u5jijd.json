        "reply": "You're missing the point entirely. The scripture says that God doesn't know those who don't seek Him. It's not that He doesn't care, but that they're not in a position to be known by Him. It's not about fairness, but about the nature of divine interaction. You're trying to apply human logic to a divine realm, which is the very issue at hand.",
        "message": "The conversation reflects a clash between theistic and atheistic worldviews, with theistic arguments emphasizing divine omniscience and the idea that non-believers are not known by God, while atheistic perspectives critique the lack of evidence and the perceived unfairness of divine judgment. Theistic arguments often rely on scriptural references and theological interpretations, while atheistic arguments challenge the logic and morality of such positions. Theistic arguments may be seen as more aligned with religious doctrine, while atheistic arguments are grounded in rational critique and skepticism. However, both sides can be seen as opinionated and not fully objective, leading to a polarized discussion."

        "reply": "You're missing the point. The text says God doesn't know them, not that He doesn't care. It's about the nature of divine knowledge and the fact that not everyone is in a relationship with Him. You're trying to force logic on a concept that's not meant to be understood in human terms. If you can't grasp that, then you're not ready for the truth.",
        "message": "It would be helpful to approach this conversation with more open-mindedness and a willingness to understand different perspectives. Both sides present valid points, and engaging in dialogue with curiosity rather than confrontation can lead to more productive and respectful discussions."
