        "reply": "You're missing the point. The issue isn't just about definitions, it's about the very nature of what is being discussed. Evolution isn't just about populations or genes; it's about the emergence of complex, self-aware entities from simple beginnings. The problem is that you're reducing it to particles and ignoring the emergent properties that define life. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of what evolution truly is.",
        "message": "The conversation highlights a common tension between scientific understanding and philosophical or definitional debates about evolution. While the user 'noganogano' is questioning the definition and scope of evolution, the responses from others, including 'danger666noodle' and 'ZappSmithBrannigan', emphasize the scientific consensus and the established definitions within biology. The scientific community widely accepts evolution as the process of change in heritable traits of populations over generations, and this is supported by extensive evidence. The debate over definitions is often a tactic used by those who are not fully informed or who are trying to challenge the scientific consensus. However, the scientific definition of evolution is well-established and widely accepted, and the discussion should focus on that rather than on definitional disputes."

        "reply": "You're missing the point. The issue isn't just about definitions, it's about the very nature of what is evolving and how we can even talk about it without falling into philosophical traps. Evolution is not just about populations or genes, it's about the emergence of complex systems from simple ones, which is a mystery that science hasn't fully explained. I'm not here to debate the definition, I'm here to question the foundations of the theory itself.",
        "message": "It would be helpful to focus on the scientific definition of evolution and the evidence supporting it, rather than getting bogged down in definitional debates. This will allow for a more productive discussion about the mechanisms and implications of evolution, rather than on whether or not one understands the term. If you have specific questions or concerns about evolution, feel free to ask, and we can address them based on the scientific consensus."
