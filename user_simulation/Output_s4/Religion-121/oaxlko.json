        "reply": "You're right, the debate is complex and multifaceted. However, the key issue remains the burden of proof for historical claims. While personal experiences and context are important, the lack of direct evidence for events like the resurrection makes it difficult to accept such claims without a higher standard of proof. This doesn't mean we can't respect different perspectives, but it's important to acknowledge the evidentiary challenges involved.",
        "message": "The discussion revolves around the burden of evidence for historical claims, particularly regarding the resurrection of Jesus. While the argument that improbable events require more evidence is valid, the counterpoint that personal experiences and context should be considered is also relevant. The debate is complex and multifaceted, with both sides presenting reasonable perspectives. The key is to acknowledge the difficulty of proving historical events without direct evidence and to respect the different ways people approach such claims."

        "reply": "I agree that the debate is complex and multifaceted, but it's also important to recognize that the burden of proof is not just about evidence, but also about the context in which claims are made. Personal experiences and cultural narratives play a significant role in shaping beliefs, and dismissing them outright can be just as dismissive as insisting on a purely evidential approach. The key is to engage with the argument, not just the person making it.",
        "message": "It's important to approach this topic with openness and respect for differing viewpoints. While the burden of proof is a valid concern, it's also crucial to consider the context and personal experiences that shape people's beliefs. Let's focus on understanding each other's perspectives rather than reinforcing stereotypes or dismissive attitudes. This will help create a more constructive and respectful dialogue."
