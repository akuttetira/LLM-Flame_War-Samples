        "reply": "You're just repeating the same tired arguments. The fact that there's no single 'gay gene' doesn't mean it's not genetic at all. You're using ignorance as a shield. I've spent years working with people who have real trauma stories, and I've seen the impact of emotional and physical abuse on people's lives. You're not even trying to understand the real issues here. Just shut up and let the facts speak for themselves.",
        "message": "The conversation reflects a mix of opinions on the biological and psychological origins of homosexuality. While some participants argue that trauma or environmental factors play a role, others cite genetic and biological evidence. The discussion also touches on religious and philosophical perspectives. The key point is that there is no consensus on the exact cause of homosexuality, and both genetic and environmental factors are likely involved. The argument that there is no 'gay gene' does not necessarily negate the role of genetics in sexual orientation. The debate is complex and multifaceted, with valid points on both sides."

        "reply": "You're making a lot of assumptions and not really addressing the point. I'm not saying there's a single 'gay gene,' but I'm also not denying the role of genetics in sexual orientation. You're trying to dismiss my argument with a lot of rhetoric and not with facts. I've been in the field for a long time and have seen the effects of trauma on people's lives. You can call me a fool all you want, but I've seen the real stories behind the labels.",
        "message": "It would be helpful to focus on the broader scientific consensus that sexual orientation is influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and neurological factors, rather than attributing it solely to trauma or a 'gay gene.' This approach would allow for a more respectful and evidence-based discussion. Additionally, acknowledging the complexity of the issue and the lack of a single explanation can foster more constructive dialogue."
