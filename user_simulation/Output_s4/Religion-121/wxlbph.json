While modern science provides insights into lactose intolerance and milk processing, the verse's wording allows for a broader interpretation that does not exclude those who cannot consume milk. The key point is that the Quran does not mandate milk consumption for everyone, and the verse's wording allows for a broader interpretation that does not exclude those who cannot consume it. The debate is not about the validity of the Quran but about how to interpret its message in the context of modern science and individual health conditions.",
        "message": "The conversation highlights a complex debate between religious interpretation and scientific understanding. While the Quran does encourage the consumption of milk, the discussion centers around the practical implications of lactose intolerance and modern milk processing. The key point is that the Quran does not mandate milk consumption for everyone, and the verse's wording allows for a broader interpretation that does not exclude those who cannot consume it. The scientific argument about lactose intolerance and modern milk processing is valid, but the religious perspective must be respected as a matter of faith. The debate is not about the validity of the Quran but about how to interpret its message in the context of modern science and individual health conditions."

        "message": "It's important to recognize that the Quran is a religious text and should be interpreted within the context of faith and tradition. At the same time, scientific understanding and individual health needs should be respected. The discussion should aim to find a balance between faith and science, and to avoid making absolute claims about the Quran's intent without considering the broader context of religious interpretation. Open and respectful dialogue is key to understanding both perspectives."
