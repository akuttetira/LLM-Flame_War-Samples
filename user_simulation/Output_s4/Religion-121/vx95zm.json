I'm using the one that's more practical and widely accepted, which is things beyond scientific understanding. The other definition you're proposing is more abstract and less useful for practical discourse. Let's focus on that definition and avoid getting bogged down in abstract or definitional disputes.",
        "message": "The conversation revolves around the definition of 'supernatural' and whether it should be considered as things beyond scientific understanding or as things that cannot be shown to exist. While both sides present valid points, the argument is more aligned with the perspective that 'supernatural' refers to things beyond scientific understanding, as this definition is more practical and widely accepted. The other side's argument, which defines 'supernatural' as something that cannot be shown to exist, is more abstract and less useful for practical discourse."

        "reply": "I agree that the practical definition of supernatural as things beyond scientific understanding is more useful. However, I still maintain that the definition you're proposing, which is things that cannot be shown to exist, is logically flawed. It's impossible to know whether something is beyond our current understanding or beyond any understanding. The key is that supernatural things are things we don't yet understand, not things we can't ever understand. And as for the connotations of supernatural, I think they are more about things that are not bound by natural laws, not about things that can't be shown to exist.",
        "message": "Both sides have valid points, but it's important to focus on the practical definition of 'supernatural' as things beyond scientific understanding. This allows for meaningful discussion about phenomena that are currently not explained by science. Let's try to keep the conversation focused on this definition and avoid getting bogged down in abstract or definitional disputes."
