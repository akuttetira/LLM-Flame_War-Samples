        "reply": "You're still missing the point. The OP was talking about how religious people use historical evidence for non-miraculous biblical claims, not about miracles. You keep bringing up the sun standing still as if that's the main issue, but that's a strawman. The real issue is that religious people often ignore historical evidence that contradicts their beliefs, and that's the problem we need to address.",
        "message": "The conversation highlights a disagreement over the role of historians in evaluating biblical claims. ShakaUVM argues that historians focus on methodological naturalism and do not engage with miracles, while the other participant counters that the OP's point was about the inconsistency in how religious people use historical evidence. The discussion becomes muddled by strawman arguments and a lack of clear focus on the original point. The 'silentokami' participant correctly identifies the strawman and the need to address the original argument about historical evidence for non-miraculous biblical claims."

        "reply": "You're right to call out the strawman, but the core issue remains: the inconsistency in how some religious people use historical evidence for non-miraculous biblical claims. The OP was pointing out that while some parts of the Bible have historical confirmation, others don't, and that's a problem. You're not engaging with that point, you're just arguing about miracles. Let's get back to the original argument about historical reliability.",
        "message": "To move forward constructively, both sides should focus on the original argument about how religious people use historical evidence for non-miraculous biblical claims. ShakaUVM can clarify the distinction between historical evidence and miracles, while the other participant can address the inconsistency in how religious people apply historical evidence. Avoid strawman arguments and stay focused on the core issue of historical reliability of non-miraculous biblical claims."
