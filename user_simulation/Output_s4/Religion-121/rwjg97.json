        "reply": "The discussion highlights a nuanced debate between definitions of 'faith' and its role in determining truth. While one side argues that 'faith' is based on evidence and can be a useful tool when grounded in reliable information, the other side emphasizes that 'faith' often involves belief without evidence, which can be unreliable. The key distinction lies in the definition of 'faith' and how it is applied in different contexts. The argument that faith is useful when based on evidence is more aligned with the primary definition of 'faith' as confidence or trust, which can be informed by evidence. However, the claim that faith is inherently without evidence is also valid in certain contexts. Ultimately, the more reasonable position is that faith can be a useful tool when based on evidence, but it should not be the sole basis for determining truth without critical evaluation of evidence.",

        "message": "It would be helpful to focus on the definition of 'faith' and how it is applied in different contexts. Both sides have valid points, but it's important to distinguish between faith based on evidence and faith without evidence. By clarifying the role of evidence in determining truth, the conversation can move towards a more productive and informed discussion."
