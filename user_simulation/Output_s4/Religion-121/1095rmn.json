        "reply": "You're right, I didn't provide concrete examples, I just gave a general example. But the point is that many atheists have beliefs that are just as weakly supported as religious beliefs. The problem is that they don't hold themselves to the same standards. I'm not saying they're wrong, just that they're inconsistent.",
        "message": "The conversation highlights a common debate between atheists and theists regarding the consistency of evidence application. While Mangalz argues that atheists often apply different standards to religion than to other beliefs, the response from others suggests that this argument can be seen as dismissive and lacks concrete examples. The discussion also touches on the complexity of belief systems and the difficulty of applying strict evidentiary standards to all areas of life. The argument is opinionated and lacks a clear, evidence-based foundation, making it difficult to determine a definitive 'right' side."

        "reply": "You're right, I did say 'Trust me bro' but I was trying to be concise. The point is that atheists often don't hold high standards for their own beliefs, just like they don't for religion. It's a consistent inconsistency. The problem is that people like me are trying to point this out, but it's met with dismissiveness and a lack of real examples. It's like saying 'there would be no crime if people just didn't commit crime!' But that's the cringe part of the argument. We need to focus on actual examples and evidence, not just abstract ideas.",
        "message": "It would be helpful to focus on specific examples and evidence to support each viewpoint. Discussing the challenges of applying strict evidentiary standards to all areas of life, and exploring how beliefs are formed in different contexts, could lead to a more constructive and informed conversation. Let's try to find common ground by examining the role of evidence and belief in various domains of human thought."
