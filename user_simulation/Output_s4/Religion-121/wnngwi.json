        "reply": "You're just repeating the same tired excuse. Child marriage is a crime, regardless of the time period. If you can't accept that, then you're just as bad as the people who supported it. The fact that you're trying to justify it by saying 'it was acceptable back then' is just another way of saying you're okay with child abuse. I'm not going to waste my time defending the actions of a man who married a 9-year-old, especially when you can't even acknowledge that it's wrong.",
        "message": "The conversation reflects a deeply contentious and emotionally charged debate about the historical and religious figure of Prophet Muhammad (\ufdfa), with participants offering opposing views on the ethical implications of his actions, particularly regarding the marriage to Aisha. The discussion is marked by strong opinions, personal attacks, and a lack of objective analysis, which makes it difficult to determine a clear 'right' side. However, the argument that focuses on the historical and cultural context of the time, while acknowledging the ethical concerns of child marriage and the potential for misuse of religious texts, is more balanced and respectful in its approach. The other side, which tends to dismiss cultural context and focuses on modern ethical standards, is more extreme and lacks nuance."

If you're going to talk about history, talk about the actual historical context, not just the cultural norms. Also, the fact that you're trying to justify the actions of a prophet by saying 'it was acceptable back then' is just another way of saying 'I don't care about the ethics of what happened.'",
        "message": "It would be more constructive to approach this discussion with an open mind, acknowledging the historical context of the time while also considering the ethical implications of the actions described. Rather than focusing on personal attacks or extreme interpretations, we can seek to understand the historical, cultural, and religious background of these events and engage in a more respectful and evidence-based dialogue. This would allow for a more meaningful and productive conversation."
