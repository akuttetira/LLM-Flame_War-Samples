        "reply": "You're missing the point. I'm not saying I'm a narcissist to get attention or to be the victim. I'm saying that I am a narcissist, and I've experienced abuse from one. I don't deny that I've been abusive, but I also don't see how I'm doing it. I'm not a toddler, I'm in my 20s, and I've had to learn how to not be abusive. I don't project, I don't shift blame, I don't make excuses. I just... I don't see how I'm doing it. I'm not trying to be the victim, I'm trying to be better. And I'm not trying to be offensive. I'm just trying to be honest about my experiences.",
        "message": "The conversation highlights a complex and sensitive topic involving narcissistic behavior and its impact on individuals. The first participant expresses strong opinions about narcissists denying their abusive behavior while being 'fake nice' in public. The second participant, identifying as a narcissist, provides a personal account of their experiences with abuse and how they navigate social interactions. The third participant challenges the second's self-identification as a narcissist, suggesting they don't exhibit typical narcissistic traits. While the first participant's perspective is valid in describing the behavior of some narcissists, the second participant's personal experience and self-identification as a narcissist require careful consideration. The third participant's challenge is also valid in questioning the accuracy of the self-identification. Therefore, the second participant's perspective is more in the right as they provide a personal account of their experiences, while the first participant's generalization about narcissists may not apply to all cases."

I don't deny I'm abusive, I just don't see how I am. I don't blame others for my behavior, I just don't understand it. I don't see how I affect others, I just do. I don't deny when I'm called out, I just don't see how I'm the problem. I don't project or make excuses, I just don't know how to change. I don't see how I'm the victim, I just don't see how I'm the problem. I don't see how I affect others, I just do. I don't deny when I'm called out, I just don't see how I'm the problem.

        "message": "It's important to approach discussions about mental health and personality disorders with empathy and openness. While the first participant's observations about narcissistic behavior are valid, it's also important to recognize that individuals can have complex experiences that may not fit into simple labels. The second participant's personal account provides valuable insight into their experiences, and the third participant's challenge is a valid question that should be addressed with care. To move forward, it would be helpful to focus on understanding the experiences of those affected by narcissistic behavior and to approach such discussions with a balanced and compassionate perspective."
