Your master's degree, your hobbies, and your goals are all signs that you're on the right path. Don't let the n-family's expectations define your worth. You're not just surviving\u2014you're thriving, and that's something to be proud of. Keep pushing forward, and you'll find your own version of success that feels authentic and fulfilling.",
        "message": "The conversation reflects a complex emotional struggle with themes of parental criticism, self-worth, and the desire for revenge through personal success. While the desire to prove a point and reject parental influence is valid, the emphasis on throwing one's life away or fighting back through public defiance can be seen as extreme. The more constructive approach is to focus on personal growth, self-acceptance, and finding a balance between standing up for oneself and not letting past relationships define one's future. The suggestion to succeed on one's own terms and then cut ties is more balanced and realistic."

You're not just fighting for yourself, you're fighting for the future you deserve. Keep putting yourself out there, keep building that life, and remember that your success is a form of revenge in itself. You don't need to prove anything to anyone else - just to yourself. You're already amazing, and that's enough.",
        "message": "It's important to remember that your worth isn't defined by others' opinions, but also that success can take many forms. Focus on your own goals and happiness, and don't let the past dictate your future. You have the right to live a life that feels authentic to you, and that's something to be proud of."
