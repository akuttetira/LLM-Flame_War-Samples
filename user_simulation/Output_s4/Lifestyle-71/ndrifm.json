Let's refocus on the original question: what strategies can someone use if they're in a situation where they might be visited? I'm looking for practical advice, not just philosophical debates about truth and deception.",
        "message": "The conversation is focused on clarifying the difference between lying about a location and not telling someone where one is going, with participants discussing the implications of each in a specific context. Meh_96 is seeking clarity and strategy in a situation where they may be at risk, while ReidFleming is dismissive and seems to be shifting the focus away from the original question. The discussion is opinionated but centered around a specific issue, and the disagreement is more about interpretation than outright contradiction."

        "reply": "I agree that the conversation has drifted, but it's important to acknowledge that both scenarios have different implications. The original question was about strategy, and I think it's worth revisiting that. ReidFleming, I understand your point, but let's not lose sight of the original issue. We all have different perspectives, but staying focused on the question at hand will help us provide better advice.",
        "message": "It might be helpful to refocus the conversation on the original question about strategies for dealing with potential visitors, and to acknowledge the different perspectives without dismissing them outright. This can help keep the discussion constructive and on track."
