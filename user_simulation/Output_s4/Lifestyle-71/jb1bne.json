It's about respecting the person's experience and not making them feel like they have to explain themselves every time. I don't think it's fair to expect someone to remember something that's not even that important to them. If they don't get it, they don't get it. But I also don't want to be a snowflake either. It's a tough balance.",
        "message": "The conversation highlights the importance of respecting personal boundaries and the sensitivity of using specific terms in contexts that may trigger someone. The original post emphasizes the need for clarity and consistency in language, particularly when discussing traumatic or sensitive topics. While it's understandable that people may not always get the nuance, the responsibility lies on the individual to communicate their needs clearly. The discussion also touches on the broader topic of identity and how language can impact someone's experience. The key point is that while language can be interchangeable in everyday use, it can carry different meanings for different people, and respecting those meanings is crucial."

It's not that I'm high maintenance, it's just that I have boundaries and I have to enforce them. I don't want to be a snowflake, but I also don't want to be hurt. It's a complicated thing. I'm not saying it's easy, but it's something I have to do. I'm not asking for everyone to get it, just that they try. And if they don't, then they're not my friends. I don't want to be a martyr, but I also don't want to be hurt. It's a tough spot.",
        "message": "It's important to acknowledge the validity of the original post's concern and the need for clear communication in sensitive contexts. At the same time, it's also important to recognize that people may not always be aware of the nuances in language, and that doesn't necessarily mean they are being disrespectful. The goal should be to foster understanding and respect for personal boundaries while also being open to learning and growing from the experience. If someone is feeling triggered or misunderstood, it's okay to set boundaries and not feel obligated to explain every time. The key is to find a balance between being clear and being patient with others' understanding."
