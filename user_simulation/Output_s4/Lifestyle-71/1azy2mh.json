        "reply": "I completely agree. The father's excuse is not only baseless but also a complete disservice to the child. The child deserves a parent who is willing to put in the work, not one who's looking for an excuse to walk away. The legal system should ensure that the child's best interests are protected, and the father's lack of commitment should not go unpunished. The mother and daughter deserve support, and the father should be held accountable for his actions.",
        "message": "The conversation contains a mix of opinions, with some users expressing empathy for the mother and daughter, others criticizing the father's lack of commitment, and some suggesting legal actions. The majority of the comments are critical of the father's reasoning and behavior, with many users emphasizing the importance of the father's responsibility to his child regardless of personal feelings or circumstances. The father's claim of not bonding with the child due to not being present at the birth is widely dismissed as a justification for his abandonment, and the focus is on the child's right to support and care. The users generally agree that the father's actions are inappropriate and that the mother and child should not be burdened by his excuses."
