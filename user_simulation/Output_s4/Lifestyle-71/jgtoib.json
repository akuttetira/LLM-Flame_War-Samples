        "reply": "It's so frustrating how many adults think they know better but end up making things worse. I completely relate to the trauma of not being taught properly. It's not just about tampons, it's about the lack of basic education and empathy from adults. We need to push for more open dialogue and better parenting. The world is full of people who don't know how to handle these things, but it's our responsibility to educate and support, not shame.",
        "message": "The conversation highlights the importance of teaching children about bodily functions and privacy in a respectful and supportive manner. The experiences shared demonstrate that many adults, including parents, may not realize the impact of their actions on children's emotional and physical well-being. While some may argue that children should be taught through trial and error, the experiences shared clearly show that this approach can lead to embarrassment, trauma, and a lack of understanding. Therefore, the side that emphasizes the need for education, support, and open communication from adults is more in the right."

        "reply": "I completely agree. It's so frustrating that adults, especially parents, don't realize how much they're impacting their children's lives. It's not just about teaching things; it's about doing it with empathy, respect, and understanding. We need to stop making kids feel like they're 'broken' or 'wrong' for not knowing something. It's time for adults to take responsibility and be better role models.",
        "message": "It's important to acknowledge the pain and trauma experienced by the individual and to recognize the need for better education and support from adults. Let's focus on creating a more empathetic and supportive environment where children feel safe and informed about their bodies. We can work towards a future where adults are more aware of the importance of teaching children in a respectful and understanding way."
