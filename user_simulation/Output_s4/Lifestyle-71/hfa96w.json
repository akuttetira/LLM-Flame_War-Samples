        "reply": "I think the key issue is that Ziwe is trying to be a 'performance artist' but it's all performative. She's not really authentic and it's clear she's just trying to get attention. It's exhausting to watch her try to be different things all the time. She's not really a performance artist, she's just a performer trying to make a name for herself.",
        "message": "The conversation reflects a mix of opinions about Ziwe's public persona and behavior, with some users criticizing her for being inconsistent, patronizing, and unconvincing as a performance artist, while others appreciate her boldness and unique approach. The majority of the feedback leans towards a critical perspective, highlighting the perceived issues with her public image and behavior."

        "reply": "I think the key issue is that Ziwe is trying to be a lot of things at once, and it's not working. She's like a walking contradiction, and that's really frustrating. It's like she's trying to be a feminist, a performance artist, a sex worker, and a genius all at the same time, but none of it really adds up. It's not that she's not trying, it's just that she's not consistent, and that's the problem.",
        "message": "It might be helpful to focus on specific examples or aspects of Ziwe's behavior that are being discussed, to ensure the conversation remains constructive and grounded in the actual content of her interviews and public appearances. This can help in understanding her motivations and the broader context of her work without personal attacks or assumptions."
