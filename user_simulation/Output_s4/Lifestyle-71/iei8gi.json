It's not about being perfect, but about being consistent and kind. I appreciate the support and understanding here, it means a lot.",
        "message": "The conversation highlights a range of experiences with parents who use authoritarian or manipulative tactics when interacting with children, often involving demands, orders, or a lack of respect for children's autonomy. While some participants describe their parents' behavior as harmful or inappropriate, others emphasize the importance of setting boundaries, using respectful language, and fostering a positive relationship with children. The key takeaway is that children should not be treated as subordinates or forced to comply with demands without consideration for their feelings or autonomy. The more respectful and empathetic approach, such as using 'please' and 'thank you' and allowing children to make choices, is more in line with healthy parent-child dynamics."

        "reply": "Absolutely, I agree. It's so important to set boundaries and treat children with respect. My mom's way of doing things was really toxic, and I'm so glad I've learned to be different with my daughter. It's not about being a slave, it's about being a good, respectful parent. I try to make sure she feels loved and appreciated, not like she has to do anything for me. It's a tough balance, but I'm doing my best.",
        "message": "It's important to recognize that every family has different dynamics, and what may seem harsh or controlling to one person may be a different expression of authority or expectation to another. However, the core principle of respecting children's autonomy, using respectful language, and fostering a positive relationship should be the guiding standard. If you're struggling with how to interact with your children or your parents, it's okay to seek support or guidance from trusted friends, family, or professionals. You're not alone in this, and there are ways to create a healthier, more respectful environment for everyone involved."
