        "reply": "I still think the original employee was way out of line. You don't get to judge someone's family in front of them, especially if they're an adult child. Even if you have a strong opinion, you have to consider the impact on others. It's not about being right, it's about respecting people's boundaries.",
        "message": "The situation is complex, with valid points on both sides. While it is inappropriate to shame or criticize someone's family in front of them, the original employee's action of reminding a colleague about the parents' potential lack of deservingness could be seen as a form of advocacy for the adult child. However, the context and tone of the conversation are critical, and the employee who was warned may have overstepped by not considering the potential impact on the adult child. The key is to balance respect for individual autonomy with the need to avoid harmful or inappropriate behavior."

        "reply": "I agree that open dialogue is better, but the original action of reminding a colleague about their parents' potential lack of deservingness is still problematic. It's one thing to have an opinion, but it's another to express it in a way that shames or criticizes someone else's family in front of them. The employee who was warned may have overstepped, but the initial statement was still inappropriate.",
        "message": "It's important to approach such situations with sensitivity and awareness of the potential impact on all parties involved. While it's valid to have strong opinions, it's equally important to consider how those opinions are expressed and their effect on others. Open and respectful dialogue, rather than confrontation, is often the most constructive way to address such concerns."
