        "reply": "I completely agree with the sentiment of focusing on personal growth and healing. It's so important to not let the past define our future. I've been working on recognizing and letting go of the negative voice in my head, and it's been a tough but rewarding process. I'm still learning and processing, but I'm making progress. The key is to find a path that feels authentic to who we are, and that's something I'm still working on. I'm grateful for the support and understanding from everyone here.",
        "message": "The conversation reflects a shared understanding of the challenges faced by individuals raised in narcissistic or toxic environments, and the complex emotions surrounding the decision to have children. While some participants express a strong desire to avoid repeating their parents' patterns, others emphasize the importance of personal growth, self-worth, and the potential for positive change. The discussion highlights the validity of different perspectives on parenting, with some advocating for child-free living as a path to healing, while others see parenting as a meaningful way to provide love and stability. The key insight is that the decision to have children is deeply personal and influenced by individual experiences, emotional healing, and life circumstances."

I\u2019ve been working on recognizing and distancing myself from my mom\u2019s toxic influence, and it\u2019s been a tough but necessary process. I\u2019m not ready to have kids just yet, but I\u2019m still learning to value myself and my own choices. I think the key is to be true to yourself and not let past experiences dictate your future. I\u2019m still figuring out what I want and how to make sure I don\u2019t repeat the same patterns. But I\u2019m not giving up on the possibility of being a good parent, just not in a rush to do so.",
        "message": "It's important to acknowledge the complexity of each person's journey and the valid reasons behind different choices. While some may feel that having children is not the right path for them, others may find purpose and fulfillment in parenting. The focus should remain on personal growth, self-worth, and the well-being of oneself and others. By staying open to different perspectives and focusing on healing, we can support each other in finding the path that feels most authentic and fulfilling."
