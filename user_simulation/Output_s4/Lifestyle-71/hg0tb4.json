That shows growth. But when it comes to things like racism, harassment, or violence, there's a clear line that shouldn't be crossed. The internet has a responsibility to hold people accountable for harmful behavior, but it also needs to be careful not to turn every awkward moment into a public shaming. It's a balance, but I think the end goal should always be to promote justice and protect people from harm.",
        "message": "The conversation highlights a complex debate around cancel culture, with valid points on both sides. On one hand, there is a concern that cancel culture can lead to unfair punishment for individuals who may not have malicious intent, and that the internet can turn harmless interactions into public shaming. On the other hand, there is a strong argument that holding individuals accountable for harmful behavior, especially when it is captured on camera, is necessary to promote justice and prevent harm. The debate is nuanced, and while cancel culture can be misused, it is also a tool for holding people accountable in a society where public scrutiny is a reality. The more right side is not clear-cut, but the argument that people should be held accountable for their actions, especially when they are harmful, is more substantiated in the context of public behavior and the role of social media in shaping public opinion."

        "reply": "I think the key is to differentiate between harmless mistakes and harmful actions. If someone is being racist or sexist, it's not just a 'bad day' but a pattern of behavior that needs to be addressed. However, if someone is just being a bit of a jerk in a moment of stress, it's not fair to go after them and ruin their lives. The internet has a way of taking the small things and making them big, which is why I think we need to be careful about how we engage with online discourse. We should hold people accountable for their actions, but not at the expense of their lives.",
        "message": "It would be helpful to focus on the broader context of accountability and the role of social media in shaping public discourse. Both sides have valid concerns, but it's important to recognize that public behavior, especially when it involves harm or discrimination, should be addressed with care and intention. Let's strive to have a more constructive conversation about how to balance accountability with fairness in the digital age."
