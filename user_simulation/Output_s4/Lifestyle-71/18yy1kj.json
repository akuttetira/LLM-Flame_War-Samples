While I believe that giving flowers can be seen as a thoughtful gesture, I also think it's important to approach the topic with education and empathy. The goal should be to make the child feel supported and informed, not overwhelmed or traumatized. It's a delicate balance, and I think both viewpoints have some merit.",
        "message": "Both perspectives have merit. The act of giving flowers can be seen as a thoughtful gesture to support a child during a significant life event, while others argue that it may overemphasize the importance of menstruation and create unnecessary stress. The key is to balance empathy with education, ensuring the child feels supported without being overwhelmed by the weight of the moment."

        "reply": "I agree that both perspectives have merit, but I still believe that giving flowers for a period is giving it more weight than it should have. It's a natural event, not a milestone, and the child doesn't need to be made to feel like a 'woman' or anything. Flowers can be a nice gesture, but they should be given with the understanding that it's just a part of life, not a big deal. The key is to support the child without adding unnecessary stress or meaning to the event.",
        "message": "It's important to acknowledge the emotional significance of the moment while also focusing on the child's well-being. Flowers can be a kind and supportive gesture, but it's equally important to provide accurate information and reassurance that menstruation is a natural part of life. The goal should be to make the child feel comfortable and informed, not overwhelmed or traumatized."
