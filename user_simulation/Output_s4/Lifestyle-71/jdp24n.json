While it's natural to reflect on one's past, the language used in responses must not validate or normalize harmful behavior. If you have questions or need support, consider reaching out to a trusted professional or support group rather than engaging in public forums where the tone can be difficult to manage.",
        "message": "The user 'Flock_with_me' is correct in their assertion that normalizing abusive behavior is inappropriate in a support forum. The original question may be valid, but the response that followed crossed the line into invalidating and normalizing abuse, which is harmful and against the forum's rules."

The original question may come from a place of pain, but the way it was addressed crossed into invalidating the experience. Support forums need to be spaces where people feel heard, not judged. If someone is struggling, they should be directed to resources that offer real help, not just a rulebook. The tone here is crucial, and it's important to maintain it.",
