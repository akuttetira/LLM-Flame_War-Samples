If you're in danger, don't hesitate to reach out to anyone you trust, including law enforcement, social services, or women's shelters. You are not alone, and there are people who care about you and want to help. Stay strong.",
        "message": "The conversation highlights a serious and urgent situation involving potential female genital mutilation (FGM), a practice that is illegal in many places, including Washington State. While the discussion touches on the legality and cultural context of FGM, the focus should remain on the immediate safety and well-being of the individual involved. The legal framework in the U.S. does not currently criminalize FGM in all states, but it is illegal in Washington State. The emotional and physical risks of FGM are severe, and the individual in the conversation is in a dangerous situation. The response from the community, including legal and support resources, is appropriate and necessary."
