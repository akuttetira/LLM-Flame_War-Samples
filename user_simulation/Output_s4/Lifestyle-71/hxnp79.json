The strength it takes to overcome such toxic environments is immense, and it's wonderful to see people finding their voice and reclaiming their autonomy. Keep sharing your story, it's a powerful way to heal and help others along the way.",
        "message": "The conversation reflects a shared experience of growing up with narcissistic parents who used emotional manipulation, control, and threats to maintain power over their children. The participants describe how their parents' behavior led to emotional trauma, self-doubt, and a lack of trust in others. While the parents' actions are clearly harmful and abusive, the discussion also highlights the resilience and strength of the individuals who have managed to overcome these challenges and begin to heal. The majority of the conversation is focused on validating the experiences of those affected and offering support, rather than blaming or attacking the parents. The participants are in the process of reclaiming their autonomy and seeking healing, which is a positive and necessary step."
