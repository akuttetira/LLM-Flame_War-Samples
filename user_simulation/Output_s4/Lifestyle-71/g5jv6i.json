        "reply": "Exactly. It\u2019s a form of emotional manipulation that\u2019s so insidious because it\u2019s not just about the words, but the underlying control and fear they create. It\u2019s important to recognize these patterns and set boundaries, but it\u2019s also crucial to do so in a way that\u2019s safe and respectful. I\u2019m so glad we\u2019re all here to share and support each other through this.",
        "message": "The conversation highlights a shared experience of anxiety and manipulation triggered by phrases like 'I need to talk to you' or 'we need to talk.' The sentiment is largely empathetic, with participants expressing understanding and validating each other's experiences. The discussion also touches on the psychological impact of such phrases, especially in the context of narcissistic abuse or control. While there is a clear consensus that these phrases are often used to induce anxiety and control, the conversation remains focused on support and understanding rather than confrontation."

        "reply": "Exactly. It\u2019s a phrase that\u2019s been weaponized to create anxiety and control. The fact that it\u2019s so common and yet so deeply triggering is really frustrating. It\u2019s like they\u2019re using language as a tool of manipulation. I think the key is to not internalize the fear and to communicate clearly what the phrase does to you. It\u2019s important to set boundaries and not let these phrases dictate your emotional state.",
        "message": "It's great that everyone is sharing their experiences and supporting each other. To continue this positive direction, let's focus on validating each other's feelings and exploring ways to set boundaries or communicate needs more clearly. If someone is feeling overwhelmed by these phrases, it's important to find a safe way to express that to the person using them, while also being mindful of the context and relationship. Let's keep the conversation supportive and constructive."
