        "reply": "Exactly. The problem with assuming things not explicitly stated is that it's like assuming someone has four legs because you didn't mention them. It's a logical fallacy. The New Testament doesn't mention Jesus's children, so we can't assume he had any. That's not evidence, that's just speculation. And if you're going to call someone immature and stupid for not having kids, you should at least have the humility to admit you don't know for sure.",
        "message": "The conversation highlights a debate about historical accuracy and the interpretation of religious texts. While the original statement about Jesus being childfree is a theological perspective, the counterargument about the New Testament not mentioning his offspring points to the limitations of historical evidence. The analogy about legs is a valid critique of assuming information not explicitly stated."

Just because the New Testament doesn't mention Jesus' children doesn't mean he didn't have any. But that's not the point. The point is that we can't just assume things based on what's not there. It's like assuming someone has four legs just because we don't talk about them. That's not a valid argument.",
