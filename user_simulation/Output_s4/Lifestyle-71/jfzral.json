        "message": "The conversation highlights a common issue of toxic family dynamics where a parent's behavior is harmful and emotionally damaging. The individuals sharing their experiences are all describing a pattern of emotional manipulation, gaslighting, and emotional abuse, which is not acceptable. While the mother's behavior is clearly problematic, the responses from the children and others in the conversation reflect a struggle to set boundaries and seek support. The key issue is that the mother's actions are harmful, and the children are often made to feel guilty or responsible for her behavior. The discussion is opinionated, but the core issue is valid and deserves attention."
