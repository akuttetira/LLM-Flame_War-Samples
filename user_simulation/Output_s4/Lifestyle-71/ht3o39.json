        "reply": "I completely agree that it's outdated and unnecessary to assume a daughter's need for underwear is embarrassing. It's a sign of a lack of understanding about childhood development and personal autonomy. As a parent, it's more about supporting and respecting her choices rather than judging. It's about being a guide, not a gatekeeper. We should be focused on her comfort and confidence, not on what's 'appropriate' or 'embarrassing.'",
        "message": "The perspective shared by madsdyd is valid and highlights a common misunderstanding or stereotype about parental expectations regarding children's clothing choices. It is natural for parents to be concerned about their children's comfort and appropriateness, but it is also important to recognize that a child's personal choices, including clothing, should be respected as part of their growing independence. The idea that a daughter's need for underwear is embarrassing to a father is not only outdated but also unnecessary and potentially harmful."

It's about respect and understanding that as she grows, she needs to feel comfortable in her own skin. I'm glad to see someone validating that perspective.",
        "message": "It's important to acknowledge that while parents may have concerns about their children's clothing, it's equally important to respect a child's autonomy and personal choices. Open and honest communication about clothing preferences can help bridge any gaps in understanding and ensure that both the child and parent feel comfortable and respected."
