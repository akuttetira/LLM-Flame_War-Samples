Some hobbies may seem trivial to others, but they can be deeply meaningful to the people who engage in them. Let's focus on understanding and respecting diverse interests without dismissing them outright.",
        "message": "The conversation highlights valid concerns about judgment and negativity towards niche hobbies, particularly within the planner community. While it's important to respect individual choices and not dismiss hobbies as 'pathetic' or 'juvenile,' it's also crucial to recognize that not all hobbies are created equal in terms of societal value or impact. The critique of 'PlannerBabe' culture is valid, but the broader point about not judging others' free time is also important. The more balanced view is that while some hobbies may be seen as trivial by others, they can still hold personal value and should be respected."

        "reply": "I completely agree. It's so frustrating when people judge hobbies just because they're not mainstream or seem 'crazy' to them. Everyone has different values and tastes, and what's trivial to one person might be a huge passion for another. The key is to respect others' choices without trying to impose our own standards. It's about finding common ground and understanding that not everything needs to be 'important' to be valid.",
        "message": "It's important to approach discussions about hobbies with empathy and an open mind. While some hobbies may be viewed as less mainstream or even trivial by others, they can still hold significant personal value for those who engage in them. Let's focus on understanding and respecting diverse interests without dismissing them outright, and instead, engage in thoughtful dialogue that acknowledges both the value of personal choice and the need for societal acceptance."
