        "message": "The conversation primarily revolves around personal experiences with narcissistic family members and the validation received from a doctor. While there are elements of humor and light-heartedness, there are also serious discussions about trauma, manipulation, and the impact of narcissistic behavior. The majority of the comments are supportive and empathetic, with a few instances of generalization or controversial statements. The more valid and constructive perspectives are those that acknowledge the complexity of narcissistic behavior and the importance of self-validation and privacy protection."
