        "reply": "You're right, Blackberrydoughnuts. It's not about labeling people as fathers or not, but about recognizing that some people may not have the capacity or desire to be good fathers. We need to be honest about that and not let ourselves be defined by the roles we're forced into. It's about giving ourselves the credit we deserve, not just for being parents, but for being the best versions of ourselves.",
        "message": "The conversation reflects a range of opinions about fatherhood and the importance of acknowledging different roles in parenting. While some participants emphasize the value of recognizing all forms of parental care, others highlight the need to critically assess the quality of a father's role. The discussion is nuanced, and both sides have valid points about the complexity of fatherhood."

        "reply": "You're absolutely right. Fatherhood isn't a one-size-fits-all concept, and it's important to recognize that not all fathers are the same. What matters is the care, support, and love a child receives, regardless of who provides it. We should focus on what's best for the child, not just the labels we attach to people.",
        "message": "It's important to acknowledge the complexity of fatherhood and the different ways people experience and define it. While some may see being a father as a fundamental role, others may argue that it's not always about the person who is a father. Let's focus on the broader theme of parenting and how we can support all children, regardless of their circumstances."
