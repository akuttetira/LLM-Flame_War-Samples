        "reply": "You're absolutely right to emphasize the importance of accuracy and empathy in trauma discussions. However, it's also crucial to recognize that trauma is not just about the frequency of events but the impact they have on an individual. A single event can be deeply traumatic, and dismissing that perspective can invalidate real experiences. The group's decision to ban the user was a strong response to misinformation, but it's equally important to foster open dialogue that respects different perspectives while upholding the truth. Let's continue to support each other with both compassion and factual understanding.",
        "message": "The comment removed by the group is incorrect in suggesting that a single event cannot be traumatic. Research supports that even a single traumatic event can lead to lifelong trauma. The group's response to remove the comment and ban the user is justified as it upholds the integrity of the support group and prevents the spread of misinformation."
