        "reply": "I think the key here is that being late is a personal thing, but when it's tied to past trauma or invalidation, it's not just about being late\u2014it's about the weight of being constantly told you're wrong or not worthy of being on time. The frustration comes from the internalized belief that you're the problem, not the situation. It's not about 'being a narcissist' or 'not caring'\u2014it's about the damage done by being told your feelings or experiences don't matter.",
        "message": "The conversation highlights a complex interplay between personal responsibility, social expectations, and the impact of past invalidation. While it's valid to feel that being late can be frustrating and that people often don't care about excessive explanations, the discussion also touches on deeper issues of trauma and systemic invalidation. The perspective that being late can be a result of systemic abuse or trauma is important and deserves consideration. However, the conversation sometimes veers into blaming the victim or oversimplifying complex emotional experiences. A balanced approach that acknowledges both the validity of personal feelings and the importance of empathy in understanding trauma is more constructive."

        "reply": "I think the key here is that we all have different experiences and ways of dealing with being late. Some of us have been invalidated so much that even the simple act of being late feels like a personal attack. Others may not even care. But the important thing is to not let the frustration of being late define our worth. We all have our own reasons, and it's not always about intention. Just because someone is late doesn't mean they're a bad person. It's just a moment in time, and we can choose how we respond to it.",
        "message": "It's important to recognize that being late can be a result of various factors, including personal circumstances and past experiences. While it's understandable to feel frustrated when people don't care about explanations, it's also important to approach these situations with empathy, especially when considering the potential impact of past invalidation. Let's focus on understanding and supporting each other rather than placing blame or oversimplifying complex emotional experiences."
