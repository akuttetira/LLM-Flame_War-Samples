It's so important to remember that you're not alone, and that there are people who care about you and want to help you heal. Setting boundaries and seeking support is a powerful step, and I'm so glad you're taking it. You deserve to be treated with respect and kindness, not abuse. Keep fighting for yourself, and don't forget that you're not broken - you're strong, and you're worthy of a better life.",
