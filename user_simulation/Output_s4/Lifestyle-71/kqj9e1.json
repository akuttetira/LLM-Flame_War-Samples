But let me say this: we all have our own struggles, and it's important to be mindful of how we speak. Let's try to be more thoughtful and less judgmental. I'm sorry if I hurt anyone.",
        "message": "The discussion reflects a complex dynamic where some users are advocating for a context of abuse on the subreddit, while others are challenging the appropriateness of such a stance. The key issue is the potential harm caused by reinforcing negative narratives, especially for individuals who may already feel guilty or marginalized. While the perspective of experiencing abuse is valid and important, it should be handled with care to avoid unintentionally validating or exacerbating harmful feelings. The subreddit's context and community norms should guide how such topics are approached."

I'm not trying to invalidate anyone's experience, but I also don't want to contribute to a cycle of guilt or self-blame. Let's try to be more mindful of how we speak, especially here. Emojis are cringe, but so is reinforcing negative narratives. Let's focus on healing, not harm.",

Let's strive to create a space that is both empathetic and respectful, ensuring that our conversations do not inadvertently harm those who are already struggling. Let's focus on supporting each other in a way that promotes healing and understanding, rather than reinforcing negative feelings."
