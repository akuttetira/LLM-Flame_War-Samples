        "reply": "I completely agree. It's so important to recognize that everyone's journey is different, and what may seem easy for one person can be incredibly challenging for another. Your experience with the therapist was a powerful step toward healing and self-discovery. Keep trusting your instincts and remember that you're not alone in this. You're capable, and you're not a failure for wanting to break free from the narratives that have been placed on you.",
        "message": "Both perspectives are valid and reflect different experiences. Makure's message emphasizes the emotional and psychological challenges of leaving controlling parents, while the deleted user's comment highlights a more straightforward experience. The conversation illustrates the complexity of the issue, with no single right answer."

I'm glad you found your path, and I hope you're on the way to a more fulfilling life. You're not alone in this, and your story is valid.",
        "message": "It's important to acknowledge that everyone's experience is unique. While some may find it easier to move out, others face significant emotional and psychological barriers. Listening to and validating each other's experiences can help foster understanding and support in the journey toward independence."
