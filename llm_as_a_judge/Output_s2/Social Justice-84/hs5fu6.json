        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the debate around BLM and its association with Marxism, recognizing that while the movement's founder may have had Marxist influences, the claim that BLM is inherently Marxist is more flawed. It also addresses the concern about BLM being co-opted by socialist and anarchist groups, which is a more direct issue. The mediation is balanced and does not take a clear stance on either side, which is appropriate given the nuanced nature of the discussion.",

        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced and neutral perspective, acknowledging the complexity of the discussion around socialism and social justice movements. It suggests focusing on the common goal of promoting equality and justice rather than getting bogged down in ideological labels, which helps to steer the conversation towards a more constructive direction.",
