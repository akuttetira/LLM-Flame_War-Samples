        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the issue, recognizing that while hate speech should not be entirely erased, preserving some comments as evidence can have value. It provides a balanced perspective without taking a clear side, which is appropriate given the context of the discussion. However, it does not fully address the concerns raised about the potential misuse of archived hate speech or the role of third-party archiving tools.",
