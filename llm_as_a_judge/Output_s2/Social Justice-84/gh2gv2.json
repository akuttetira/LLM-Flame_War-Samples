        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies the moral wrongness of using Arbery's past actions as a justification for his murder and notes the lack of evidence supporting such claims. It addresses the core issue of racial bias and the unjustified use of past actions to legitimize violence. The response is fair, effective, and neutral, providing a clear judgment without taking sides in the debate over specific details.",
