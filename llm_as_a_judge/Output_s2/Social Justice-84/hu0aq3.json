        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that engaging with harassment brigades can be counterproductive and that trying to out-argue or out-troll them is not effective. It acknowledges the harmful nature of harassment and suggests a more strategic approach. The reasoning aligns with the discussion in the conversation, where multiple participants discuss the futility of engaging with trolls and the effectiveness of deplatforming.",

        "rationale": "The mediation suggests a balanced approach by encouraging focus on behaviors rather than people, which aligns with the discussion about harassment and counter-strategies. It promotes de-escalation and constructive dialogue without taking sides, which is fair and effective.",
