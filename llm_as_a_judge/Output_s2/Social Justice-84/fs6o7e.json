        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the issue by recognizing that some subreddits may claim to be feminist but engage in transphobic behavior, while also noting the broader context of subreddits being banned for being hard right. This balanced approach reflects a nuanced understanding of the debate, though it does not fully resolve the underlying disagreement about the nature of GenderCritical and itsafetish subreddits.",

        "rationale": "The mediation provides a neutral and constructive approach by encouraging a focus on specific examples and behaviors rather than making broad accusations. It aims to guide the conversation towards identifying and addressing transphobic content in a more structured and objective manner. This approach is fair, effective, and maintains neutrality.",
