    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively steers the conversation back to the central issue of hate speech, acknowledging the concern about 'jogger' being used as a racial slur. It promotes a respectful dialogue by focusing on the problem rather than personal attacks, and it encourages agreement on the issue while allowing for disagreement on solutions.
