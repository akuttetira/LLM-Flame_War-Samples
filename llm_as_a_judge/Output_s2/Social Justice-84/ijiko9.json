        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the issue, recognizing that hate speech and violence against marginalized groups are part of a broader pattern of normalization. It also addresses the harm caused by such rhetoric, which is important. However, the mediation does not fully resolve the debate between the equivalence of hate speech and violence, nor does it provide a clear judgment on which side is more correct. It remains somewhat neutral but could be more definitive in its stance.",
