    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance the discussion by acknowledging the argument that criticizing media coverage of Trump's defeat as 'enemies of the people' could be seen as a legitimate critique rather than hate speech. However, it doesn't fully address the underlying issues of antisemitism and the context of the subreddit's rules regarding hate speech and participation. The score is moderate as it provides some nuance but lacks a clear resolution of the conflict.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively steers the conversation back to the central issue of whether reporting on Trump's loss constitutes hate speech, while encouraging a focus on context and implications rather than personal attacks. It maintains neutrality and encourages constructive dialogue.",
