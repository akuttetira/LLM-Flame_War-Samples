        "rationale": "The mediation correctly acknowledges the nuanced interpretation of the phrase 'all men are created equal' and addresses the context in which it was used. It provides a balanced perspective by pointing out that the phrase can be misinterpreted and is not a direct statement of equality. The mediation does not take a clear side in the debate but rather offers a more defensible argument for the nuanced interpretation, which is fair and effective.",
