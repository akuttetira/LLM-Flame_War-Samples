    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance the argument about the Democratic Party's shift towards the center and the dismissive attitude towards left-wing concerns, while also acknowledging the criticism of right-wing fanatics. However, it doesn't fully address the underlying tensions in the original conversation, such as the accusation against Illhan Omar and the broader political context. The score reflects a moderate evaluation of the mediation's fairness and effectiveness.",

        "rationale": "The mediation provides a neutral and constructive approach by encouraging focus on the substance of the issues rather than personal attacks or labels. It acknowledges the frustration in the conversation and suggests a more productive direction without taking sides or making judgments.",
