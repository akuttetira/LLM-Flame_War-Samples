        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced assessment by acknowledging the complexity of the situation and different perspectives. It recognizes the defensibility of the societal change argument while also addressing the potential oversimplification of Elliot Page's motivations. The response is fair, neutral, and does not take a definitive side on the issue.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a supportive and neutral approach, encouraging focus on emotions and experiences rather than assumptions.
