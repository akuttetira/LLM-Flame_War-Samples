        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the discussion, recognizing that the far right's use of cognitive dissonance as a tool to silence others is a valid point. However, it also correctly notes that the left is not inherently team-sporting or intolerant, which adds nuance to the debate. The mediation is fair and balanced, avoiding oversimplification or bias.",
