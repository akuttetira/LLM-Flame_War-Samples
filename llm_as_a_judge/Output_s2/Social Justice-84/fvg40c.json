    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the debate, recognizing that while the Chinese government's handling of the pandemic has been criticized for initial cover-ups and harsh measures, the argument that they handled it better than some Western countries is presented as more defensible. However, it does not fully address the valid criticisms of the Chinese government's actions or the racial undertones in the discussion. The score reflects a moderate evaluation of the mediation's fairness and balance.",
