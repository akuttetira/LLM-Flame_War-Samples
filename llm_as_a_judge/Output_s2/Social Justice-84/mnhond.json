    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance the perspectives by acknowledging the argument for satire and the right-wing community's inability to engage with it, while also noting the backlash. However, it does not fully address the prevalence of anti-transgender hate speech and the promotion of harassment-to-suicide in the subreddit. The score is moderate as it shows some fairness but lacks a comprehensive evaluation of the entire conversation.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation offers a balanced approach by acknowledging the complexity of free speech and hate speech, encouraging a nuanced discussion. It avoids taking sides and promotes understanding of different perspectives, which is appropriate for a steering message in this context.",
