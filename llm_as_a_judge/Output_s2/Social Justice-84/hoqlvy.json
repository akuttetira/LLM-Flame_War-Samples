        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the situation, recognizing that the mods may be facing challenges in managing the subreddit and that the admins may not be providing adequate support. However, it does not directly address the core issue of the racist content being kept up. The score is moderate as the mediation provides some insight into the broader context but does not clearly determine which side is correct in the specific instance of the racist video.",
