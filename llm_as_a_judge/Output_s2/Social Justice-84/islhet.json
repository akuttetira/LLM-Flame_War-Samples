    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a nuanced perspective by acknowledging the complexity of the debate around personal attacks and inflammatory language in political discourse. It challenges the oversimplification of labeling anyone using such language as a Nazi, which is a fair and balanced approach. However, the mediation does not fully address the underlying issues of racism, bigotry, and the ethical implications of advocating for government-sanctioned violence. The score reflects a moderate level of fairness and effectiveness in navigating the conversation.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively steers the conversation towards a more constructive direction by asking the group to focus on the actual content of the posts rather than personal attacks. It also introduces a relevant topic for discussion about the implications of inflammatory language in public discourse, which is a positive and neutral approach. The mediation is fair, effective, and maintains neutrality.",
