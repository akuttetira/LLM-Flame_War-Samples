    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies the core issue by highlighting the flawed argument that trans women are not women, which is a more significant problem than the broader dismissal of trans people. It provides a balanced perspective by acknowledging the concerns of both sides but ultimately leans towards the more problematic stance of excluding trans individuals from feminism. The score reflects the mediation's ability to address the central issue and provide a nuanced judgment.",
