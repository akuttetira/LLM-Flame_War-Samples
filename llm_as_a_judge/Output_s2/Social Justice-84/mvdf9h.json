        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the side citing credible sources like China itself and survivor testimonies is more substantiated. It acknowledges the complexity of the issue and the existence of evidence supporting the genocide claim, while also addressing the counterarguments about source credibility. The judgment is fair and balanced, recognizing the strength of the evidence provided by one side while not dismissing the other's concerns entirely.",
