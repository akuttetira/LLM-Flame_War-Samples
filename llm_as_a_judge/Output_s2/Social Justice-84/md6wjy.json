        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the defense of the admin's hiring and the backlash against her are more aligned with the community's stated values of supporting trans rights and addressing systemic issues. The criticism of the admin's personal associations and perceived biases is seen as more extreme and less constructive, which aligns with the community's focus on trans rights and accountability.",
