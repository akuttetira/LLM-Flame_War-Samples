        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument about selective enforcement is stronger than the free speech claim. The conversation provides substantial evidence that Reddit has taken a lenient approach towards The_Donald subreddit compared to other similar subreddits, including the presence of violent and extremist content, lack of moderation, and actions taken by moderators. The mediation acknowledges this selective enforcement without taking a sides, which is fair and balanced.",
