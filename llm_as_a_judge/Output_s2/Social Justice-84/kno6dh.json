        "rationale": "The mediation offers a balanced perspective by acknowledging the complexity of the argument, recognizing that the meme might be more about mocking the police than Floyd himself. It does not outright dismiss the concern about making fun of Floyd\u2019s death but instead presents a nuanced view. However, it could have been more neutral in its language and avoided taking a side in the debate.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively steers the conversation towards separating the discussion of making fun of the police from making fun of George Floyd's death, which is a key point in the original conversation. It encourages a more focused and respectful discussion about the specific meme in question.",
