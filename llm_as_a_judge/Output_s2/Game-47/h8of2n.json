        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the discussion, recognizing that some critics may have personal biases or motivations beyond a genuine critique of the game. It also addresses the 'SJW agenda' argument by suggesting it may be a more defensible position than blanket dismissal of all criticism. However, the mediation does not fully address the broader issues of online toxicity, the role of spoilers, or the diversity of opinions on the game. It provides a balanced perspective but could have been more comprehensive.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the tension in the conversation and encourages a more respectful and focused discussion. It recognizes that some participants are overly worked up while others are genuinely invested, and it suggests a way to separate personal attacks from the actual discussion about the game. The message is neutral, fair, and aims to steer the conversation towards a more constructive direction.",
