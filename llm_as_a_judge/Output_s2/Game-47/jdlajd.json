    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance the arguments by acknowledging the nuance of freedom of speech in private companies' policies. It recognizes that companies can set their own rules and that the claim about Sony's policy being oppressive is too simplistic. However, it doesn't clearly resolve the debate between free speech and privacy concerns, and the score reflects a moderate evaluation of the mediation's effectiveness.",
