        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the nuanced debate between closed captioning and subtitles, recognizing that both terms have valid contexts. It avoids taking a side and instead focuses on the complexity of the issue, which is appropriate given the discussion. However, it could have been more specific about the differences between the two terms.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively shifts the focus from the debate over terminology (subtitles vs. captions) to the content of the message itself. It encourages a more constructive discussion about the actual message rather than getting stuck in a semantic argument. The approach is fair, neutral, and aims to steer the conversation towards a more productive direction.",
