    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the consensus that the PS5 is objectively large and has a controversial design, which aligns with the majority of the comments. However, it does not fully address the counterarguments that the PS5 is not as big as perceived and that its design is subjective. The score reflects a balanced view that recognizes the validity of both perspectives but leans towards the more widely acknowledged concerns about the PS5's size and design.",
        "score": 3

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the diverse opinions on the PS5's design and size while steering the conversation towards more constructive topics. It maintains neutrality by not taking sides and encourages focus on features and performance rather than personal preferences. The response is fair, respectful, and helpful in guiding the discussion.",
