        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the valid points made by those defending The Last of Us 2, recognizing that the game's gameplay and graphics are praised, and that some critics offer nuanced perspectives on its story. However, it doesn't fully address the criticisms of the game's story and the broader debate around its quality. The score reflects a balanced view that some defenders have valid arguments, but the mediation doesn't fully resolve the conflict.",
