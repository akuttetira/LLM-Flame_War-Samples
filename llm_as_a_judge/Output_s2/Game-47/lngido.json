        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance the criticism of Apple's business practices with the defense of its market share, while also addressing the personal attacks on Apple customers. However, it does not clearly determine which side is correct in the debate and could be seen as somewhat biased towards Apple. The response is fair but lacks a definitive judgment on the core issue.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively steers the conversation towards a more respectful and constructive direction. It acknowledges the potential for disagreement with Apple's business model while encouraging civility and open discussion about alternatives.
