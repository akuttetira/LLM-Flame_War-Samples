        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the user's valid critique of Bloodborne's design while also addressing the dismissive tone in the conversation. It provides a balanced perspective by recognizing the user's frustration with the game's mechanics but also pointing out the lack of respect in their response. The score reflects a fair assessment that the user's concerns are valid but their attitude detracts from the discussion.",
