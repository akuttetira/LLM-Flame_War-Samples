        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance the arguments by acknowledging the plausibility of the marketing mismanagement claim while also addressing the industry-wide issues. However, it is somewhat vague and does not clearly resolve the core disagreement between the two perspectives.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a constructive steer by suggesting focusing on specific examples rather than broad generalizations. It encourages a more nuanced discussion about marketing decisions and supply chain issues, which is fair and helpful for moving the conversation forward. The tone is neutral and supportive.",
