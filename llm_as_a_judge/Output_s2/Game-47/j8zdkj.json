        "rationale": "The mediation correctly acknowledges the complexity of the discussion, balancing the critique of Felix's past comments with the appreciation of his design. It provides a nuanced perspective that avoids oversimplification and maintains fairness by not entirely dismissing either side's arguments. However, it could have been more neutral in addressing the debate around his 'cult following' and the relevance of his past actions.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively addresses the issue of conflating Felix Kjellberg's design with his personal character, steering the conversation back to the design itself. It acknowledges the complexity of the discussion while promoting a more neutral and focused dialogue.",
