        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the actions of griefing or standing on yellow tubes have a significant impact on the game's progression and enjoyment. It acknowledges the perspective of those who view these behaviors as disruptive, which is fair and balanced. However, it doesn't fully address the counterargument that these behaviors can be part of the game's humor or that they are not always intentional. The score reflects a fair assessment of the situation.",
