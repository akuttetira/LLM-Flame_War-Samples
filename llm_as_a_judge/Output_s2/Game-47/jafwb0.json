        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies the key issue in the conversation, distinguishing between the performance of games on older hardware and the quality of cross-platform games. It provides a balanced perspective by acknowledging the validity of both sides' arguments while leaning towards the more defensible position. The mediation is fair, effective, and neutral.",

        "rationale": "The mediation offers a constructive direction to refocus the conversation on the games themselves rather than the platforms. It encourages positive discussion about the PS5 launch titles and what players are excited about, which promotes a more productive and neutral dialogue. The suggestion is fair and effective in steering the conversation towards a more constructive and enjoyable topic.",
