    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the situation by considering both perspectives. It recognizes that Billet Labs might have been coerced or unaware of the implications of lending a prototype without an NDA, which is a balanced approach. However, it does not fully address the ethical concerns raised about LTT's actions. The score reflects a moderate evaluation of the mediation's fairness and neutrality.",

        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced perspective, acknowledging the complexity of NDAs and suggesting a more nuanced discussion. It avoids taking sides and encourages a more thoughtful analysis of the situation, which is fair and effective. However, it could have been more specific in guiding the conversation towards resolving the underlying issues.",
