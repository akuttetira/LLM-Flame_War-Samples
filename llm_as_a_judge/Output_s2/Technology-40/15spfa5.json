    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance the arguments presented, acknowledging both the potential impact of a toxic work environment on mental health and the alleged sexist and abusive behavior of LTT management. However, it leans slightly towards the perspective that Maddison's actions may be more indicative of personal issues rather than a direct result of the work environment. This could be seen as somewhat problematic given the context of the conversation, which highlights the severity of the workplace abuse and its impact on Maddison's mental health. The score reflects a moderate evaluation of the mediation's fairness and neutrality.",
