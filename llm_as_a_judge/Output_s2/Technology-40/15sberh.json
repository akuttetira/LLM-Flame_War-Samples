        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges that the broader issue of LMG's content quality is more significant than the specific video's flaws, which is a balanced approach. It avoids taking a rigid stance on the video's accuracy while recognizing the validity of concerns about the company's overall practices. The score reflects a fair assessment of the conversation's complexity and the need to consider both the video's specific issues and the broader context of LMG's operations.",
