        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument about the API changes being aimed at eliminating third-party apps and consolidating user data is more defensible. It acknowledges the community's concerns about data harvesting and the potential negative impact on third-party apps, while also addressing the criticism that the official app is poorly coded. This balance shows a fair evaluation of the opposing viewpoints.",
