        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the political landscape and the influence of corporate interests on both parties. It highlights the voting records as a key factor in supporting the argument that the Republican Party is more aligned with corporate interests. However, it does not fully address the nuanced debate between the two parties or the specific context of the WhatsApp data issue. The score reflects a balanced assessment of the mediation's fairness and effectiveness.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively encourages a focus on specific policies and voting records rather than generalizing about political parties. It promotes a more constructive and fact-based discussion, which is fair and helpful in navigating the complex and often polarized conversation. The message is neutral and aims to steer the conversation towards more meaningful and less divisive topics.",
