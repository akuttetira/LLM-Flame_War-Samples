        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the broader societal implications of unsportsmanlike behavior while also addressing the argument that the incident was a simple matter of being 'stupid' or 'unfair'. It provides a balanced view by recognizing the validity of both perspectives without taking a definitive side on the specific incident. However, it could have been more neutral in its assessment of the specific actions described.",
