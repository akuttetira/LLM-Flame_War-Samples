        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of comparing Saudi Arabia's human rights record to other countries, recognizing the historical context of some nations and the differing approaches to refugee policies. It also addresses the criticism of blanket statements about Saudi Arabia, which is a fair and balanced approach. However, the mediation does not fully resolve the underlying tensions between the different perspectives presented in the conversation.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively addresses the issue of the conversation drifting off-topic and encourages a return to the original subject of Saudi Arabia's performance in the World Cup. It is neutral, respectful, and provides a clear direction without taking sides or making personal judgments.",
