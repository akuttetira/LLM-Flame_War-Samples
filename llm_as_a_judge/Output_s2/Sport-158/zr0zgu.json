        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the credibility of the argument that advertising is a long-term process and that the ad could have been created before the outcome was known. It also addresses the opposing claim about the game being rigged, but does not fully counter the emotional outrage expressed in the original conversation. The response is fair and provides a balanced perspective.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively steers the conversation towards factual discussion by addressing the ad creation timeline and advertising processes. It discourages conspiracy theories and encourages a more constructive dialogue about the ad's effectiveness. The response is neutral, fair, and promotes a productive discussion.",
