    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that TheGardiner's criticism of FOX broadcasts is overly broad and not well-supported, while the argument for BBC/ITV's traditional commentary style is more reasonable. However, the mediation could have been more neutral by acknowledging the validity of both perspectives without clearly favoring one side.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges differing opinions on commentary style and broadcast preferences, promoting a neutral, inclusive perspective. It encourages focusing on the main purpose of enjoying the game and respects individual preferences for different broadcasts. The tone is respectful and does not take sides, making it a fair and effective steering message.",
