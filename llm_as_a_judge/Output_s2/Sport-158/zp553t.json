    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the argument, recognizing both the diversity of France's population and the role of training programs in the success of the football team. It also addresses the counterargument about the players' heritage, but does not fully resolve the underlying tensions or provide a balanced perspective on national identity and representation. The score reflects a moderate evaluation of the mediation's fairness and effectiveness.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively redirects the conversation back to the main topic of Mbappe's achievements, avoiding the divisive and inappropriate discussion of nationality and ethnicity. It promotes focus and neutrality by steering the conversation towards the subject at hand.",
