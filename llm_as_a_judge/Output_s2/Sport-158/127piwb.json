        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of evaluating someone's character based on past achievements and a single rule change, which shows a nuanced understanding of the debate. However, it doesn't directly address the specific points made by the users or provide a clear resolution to the conflict.",

        "rationale": "The mediation provides a constructive direction to keep the discussion civil and focused on the rule change rather than personal attacks. It encourages a respectful debate about specific aspects of the rule, which is fair and effective.",
