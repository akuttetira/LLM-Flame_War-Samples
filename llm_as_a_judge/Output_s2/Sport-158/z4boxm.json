        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the argument, recognizing that supporting a national team does not necessarily equate to supporting the government. However, it does not clearly resolve the underlying conflict or provide a balanced perspective on the political implications of supporting different national teams. The score reflects a moderate level of fairness and neutrality.",

        "rationale": "The mediation provides a neutral and conciliatory message that steers the conversation back to the main topic of the World Cup, while acknowledging the right to disagree with political views without disliking the team or its fans. It is effective in promoting a positive and inclusive environment.",
