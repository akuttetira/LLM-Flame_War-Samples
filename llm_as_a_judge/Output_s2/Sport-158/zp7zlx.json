        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to address the differing comfort levels in celebrating and suggests moving past the conflict. However, it lacks depth and fails to address the underlying issues of respect and understanding between the parties. It's a surface-level attempt to steer the conversation rather than provide a meaningful resolution.",
