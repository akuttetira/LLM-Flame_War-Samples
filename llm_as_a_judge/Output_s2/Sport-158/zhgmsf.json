        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the situation, recognizing that both sides have valid points. It credits the argument about the referee's decisions and unfair treatment of the Dutch team while challenging the overly simplistic claim that Dutch fans are the only ones being unfair. This shows a balanced approach.",
