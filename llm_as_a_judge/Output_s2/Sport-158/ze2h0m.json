        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the issue, recognizing that while some Brazilians may engage in xenophobic behavior, the broader claim that all Brazilians are racist or xenophobic is not fully supported. It provides a balanced perspective by highlighting the unfair targeting of Brazilian players and the need to avoid generalizations. However, it does not fully resolve the underlying tensions or provide clear guidance for moving forward.",
