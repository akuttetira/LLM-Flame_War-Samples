        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the side defending the World Cup's legitimacy and criticizing the opposing side for bias is more reasonable, as the other side makes unsupported claims about the tournament being rigged without evidence. The judgment is fair and effective in addressing the conversation's dynamics.",
