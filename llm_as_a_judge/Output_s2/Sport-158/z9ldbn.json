        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the debate, recognizing that while there are multiple valid terms, the argument for a single, universally accepted term is more nuanced. It also addresses the counterargument about linguistic diversity, showing a balanced understanding of both sides. However, it doesn't clearly decide which side is entirely correct, which is appropriate given the topic's nature.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively promotes clarity and respect for different perspectives, encouraging a focus on enjoying the game rather than getting entrenched in the debate. It avoids taking sides and maintains a neutral, conciliatory tone, which is appropriate for a steering message in this context.",
