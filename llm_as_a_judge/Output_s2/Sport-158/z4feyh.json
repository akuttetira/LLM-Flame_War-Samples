        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges valid concerns about Qatar's human rights record and worker deaths while also addressing the critique of dismissing these issues as media hype. It provides a balanced perspective by recognizing both sides of the argument without taking a clear side. The response is fair, neutral, and effective in steering the conversation towards a more constructive discussion.",
