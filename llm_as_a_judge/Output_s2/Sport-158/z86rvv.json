        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies the issue of generalizing fan behavior and acknowledges the complexity of the situation. It provides a balanced perspective by noting that both countries have racist fans, which is more fair and reasonable than making a blanket statement about one country's fans. The response is neutral and does not take a side, which is appropriate for a mediation.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively addresses the issue of generalizing negative traits to an entire nation or group, promoting a more neutral and inclusive perspective. It encourages focusing on the sport rather than hate, which is fair and constructive. The response is well-worded and maintains neutrality without taking sides.",
