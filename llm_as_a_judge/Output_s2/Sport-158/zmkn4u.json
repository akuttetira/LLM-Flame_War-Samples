        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the initial argument about Messi's wealth and the joke about his grandma are more inflammatory than the original comment. It addresses the core issue without taking sides, maintaining neutrality and focusing on the tone of the discussion.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively steers the conversation back to the original joke about the 'grandma' meme, acknowledging the humor while avoiding deeper discussions about wealth or politics. It maintains a neutral tone and encourages a focus on the humor rather than the controversy.",
