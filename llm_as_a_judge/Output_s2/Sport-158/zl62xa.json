        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the argument and challenges the use of derogatory terms, which shows a balanced approach. However, it does not directly address the underlying issue of criticism towards Messi and Argentina from European fans, nor does it offer a clear resolution or guidance for the conversation.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a constructive direction to focus on specific criticisms or praise rather than generalizing about fanbases, which helps maintain neutrality and encourages a more productive discussion. It addresses the issue without taking sides.",
