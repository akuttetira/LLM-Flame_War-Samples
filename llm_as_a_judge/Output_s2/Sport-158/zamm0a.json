        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the validity of both perspectives but leans towards defending the idea that watching football is a legitimate leisure activity and that some people have professional jobs in the industry. It provides a balanced judgment without being overly biased towards one side, though it slightly favors the argument that watching football is a valid activity. The score reflects a moderate level of fairness and effectiveness in addressing the conversation's core issue.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively steers the conversation back to a positive focus on football rather than the debate over jobs. It maintains neutrality, promotes inclusivity, and encourages constructive interaction. The response is fair, concise, and helpful in redirecting the discussion.",
