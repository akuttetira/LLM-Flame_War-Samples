        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the situation by recognizing both the team's performance and the fans' emotional response. It provides a balanced view by suggesting that England's loss may be attributed to the opponent's strength rather than solely to the fans' reactions. However, the mediation could have been more neutral in addressing the specific accusations made in the conversation.",
