        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the argument, recognizing that both sides have valid points regarding rule interpretation and referee judgment. However, it does not clearly determine which side is correct or provide a decisive conclusion, which is necessary for a judgment type. The response is fair and balanced but lacks the decisiveness required for a judgment.",
