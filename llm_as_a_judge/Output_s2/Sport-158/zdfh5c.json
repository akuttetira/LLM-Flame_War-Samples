        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the validity of the argument that East-Asian teams have outperformed CONCACAF teams in specific categories like goals scored, while also pointing out the overgeneralization of claiming superiority across all areas. This balanced approach reflects fairness and neutrality, addressing both sides of the discussion without taking a definitive stance on which is entirely correct.",
