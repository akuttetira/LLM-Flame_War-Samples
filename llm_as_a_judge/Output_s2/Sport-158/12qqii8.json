        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the debate between Ronaldo's memorable persona and Messi's greatness, recognizing that Ronaldo's signature celebration has a lasting cultural impact. It also respects Messi's achievements and avoids dismissing them solely based on the absence of a signature move. The judgment is balanced and provides a nuanced perspective without taking a definitive stance on either player's legacy.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively steers the conversation away from personal celebrations and towards actual football skills and achievements. It addresses the core issue of recognition based on merit rather than memorability of a player's persona, promoting a more neutral and fair discussion.",
