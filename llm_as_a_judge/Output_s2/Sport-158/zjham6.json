        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that focusing on Qatar's specific issue of migrant worker exploitation is more defensible than dismissing the World Cup due to broader Western exploitation concerns. It acknowledges the complexity of the issue without fully resolving the debate, which is fair and neutral.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively steers the conversation back to the specific issue of worker exploitation in Qatar while acknowledging the complexity of the topic. It avoids escalating the debate into a broader critique of Western actions and encourages a more focused discussion on the specific issue at hand.
