        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the argument for Modric's consistency and effectiveness, which is supported by multiple users. However, it doesn't fully address the counterarguments about Zidane's flair and historical significance, which are also presented in the conversation. The score reflects a balanced acknowledgment of both perspectives but leans more towards Modric's consistency.",
