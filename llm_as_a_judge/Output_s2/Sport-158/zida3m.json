        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the situation by recognizing both teams' poor sportsmanship and the emotional context of Van Gaal's reaction, while also addressing the broader issue of racial bias and xenophobia.

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the passion for football while encouraging a more objective discussion. It highlights the mutual guilt of both teams in trash talk and urges focusing on the game rather than personal attacks. The message is fair, neutral, and promotes constructive dialogue.",
