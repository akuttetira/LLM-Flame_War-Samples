        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the debate around Neuer's action, recognizing valid points from both sides. It avoids taking a definitive stance and instead highlights the nuanced nature of the argument, which is appropriate given the lack of clear-cut evidence. The response is fair and balanced.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively steers the conversation back to the main topic of the incident in question, encouraging participants to focus on the actual event rather than personal opinions or past celebrations. It promotes a more constructive and neutral discussion by asking about the criteria for a clean tackle versus a foul, which is relevant and fair. The response is concise and does not take sides, making it a good example of a neutral and effective mediation.",
