        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that France's squad quality and England's weaknesses make a 3-1 or higher scoreline more likely. It acknowledges both sides' points but leans towards the more compelling argument about France's strength and England's weaknesses. The judgement is fair and effective in resolving the disagreement.",
