        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument about Morocco's win not being an upset due to them being favorites is more defensible. It also addresses the issue of racism and personal attacks, which were central to the discussion. The mediation provides a balanced view by acknowledging the definition of 'upset' and the context of the match, while also pointing out the problematic aspects of the conversation.",
