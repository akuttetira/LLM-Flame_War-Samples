        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument about Mussolini's right-wing affiliation being suitable for Rangers is more defensible than the personal attacks and mischaracterizations. However, it does not clearly determine which side is correct in the political alignment debate, and the score should reflect that it is a judgment but not a definitive resolution.",

        "rationale": "The mediation provides a neutral and constructive approach by shifting the focus back to the football aspect, which helps de-escalate the heated political discussion. It encourages a more respectful and factual conversation about the player's impact on the team rather than engaging in political rhetoric. The response is fair and effective in steering the conversation towards a more productive direction.",
