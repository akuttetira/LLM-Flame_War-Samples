        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the issue, recognizing that the celebration of joy with music and dance may not be universally considered haram in Islamic tradition. It also highlights the importance of considering personal expression and the nuances of religious practice. However, it does not fully address the religious perspective that some interpretations of Islamic teachings do consider such celebrations as haram. The score reflects a balanced view that acknowledges both sides but leans towards the perspective that the celebration is not universally forbidden.",
