        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to address the debate by acknowledging the argument for unification in the Olympics but not the World Cup. However, it does not clearly resolve the underlying tensions or provide a neutral, balanced perspective on the topic. The score reflects a moderate evaluation due to the lack of a definitive resolution and the potential for further misunderstanding.",

        "rationale": "The mediation provides a neutral and positive approach to the discussion, acknowledging the different perspectives and encouraging mutual learning. It avoids taking sides and promotes understanding, which is appropriate for a steering message in a conversation with strong opinions.",
