        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the person defending DiverMary is highlighting toxic and emotionally abusive behavior from AdLucky2882, which is a valid concern. The other side dismisses the incident as harmless, which overlooks the potential harm and toxicity in the interaction. The mediation is fair, effective, and neutral in assessing the situation.",

    },
    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively steers the conversation back to the central issue of DiverMary's behavior and what constitutes a 'clutch' performance, while avoiding personal attacks. It promotes a more constructive and focused discussion about the game's narrative rather than engaging in hostile or irrelevant commentary.",
