        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the validity of both sides' arguments but leans slightly towards the argument that Senegal's performance against the Dutch is a better indicator of their potential against England. This shows some balance but still favors one perspective over the other, which may not be fully neutral.",
        "score": 3
    },
    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced approach by acknowledging both sides' perspectives, focusing on factual aspects of the match, and encouraging a more constructive discussion. It steers the conversation towards analyzing reasons why Senegal might beat England rather than making definitive claims. The response is fair, neutral, and effective in guiding the discussion.",
