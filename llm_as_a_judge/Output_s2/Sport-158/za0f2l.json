        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the debate around possession as a metric and recognizes that both sides have valid points. It also suggests a more objective analysis of the game's data, which is a fair and balanced approach. However, it does not clearly determine which side is correct, which is appropriate for a judgement type.",

It promotes understanding over confrontation and avoids taking sides, which is fair and constructive.",
