    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the debate, recognizing both the importance of LGBT+ rights and the political aspects of football. It provides a balanced perspective by suggesting that the argument for LGBT+ rights is more defensible than the dismissive stance towards Germany's actions. However, the mediation could have been more neutral in its assessment and less biased towards one side of the argument.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempt to steer the conversation back to the main topic of football by emphasizing sportsmanship and athleticism, while avoiding political or personal agendas. It acknowledges the heated discussion but tries to keep the focus on the game itself. However, it doesn't directly address the underlying issues of discrimination or the specific arguments made by the users. The tone is neutral and attempts to de-escalate the situation, but it could have been more specific in addressing the core concerns.",
