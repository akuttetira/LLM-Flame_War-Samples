    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of cultural context and the nuance in the argument about Mbapp\u00e9's comments, which is a fair and balanced approach. It does not outright dismiss the criticism of Mbapp\u00e9 but also recognizes the validity of the counterpoint about South American football culture. This shows a reasonable effort to consider multiple perspectives.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively addresses the conversation by acknowledging Mbapp\u00e9's comments as potentially out of line while avoiding generalization of an entire culture. It also highlights Mbapp\u00e9's maturity in responding, which helps to steer the discussion towards a more constructive and neutral direction. The message is fair, balanced, and encourages focusing on the specific context rather than broad cultural assumptions.",
