        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to acknowledge the complexity of the situation by recognizing the author's perspective while also pointing out the racism. However, it is somewhat unclear and lacks a clear, neutral evaluation of the arguments presented. The judgment is not entirely fair or balanced, as it does not fully address the context or the validity of the claims made by both sides.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a neutral and constructive approach to guide the conversation towards a more objective discussion of the events described, without focusing on personal views or assumptions about the authors' identities. It encourages a focus on the content rather than the individuals involved, which is fair and effective for maintaining a respectful dialogue.",
