        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges that the argument about luck in Morocco's victory is more defensible, which is fair and balanced. It also addresses the concern about Morocco's future success without making a definitive judgment, maintaining neutrality. However, it could have been more comprehensive in addressing all perspectives.",
