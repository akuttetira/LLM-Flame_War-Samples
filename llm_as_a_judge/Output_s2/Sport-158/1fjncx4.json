        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the validity of both sides' arguments but leans towards the perspective that the new format may lead to more dead rubbers and less competitive games. This is a balanced approach, though it slightly favors one side over the other. The reasoning is based on the discussion around the impact of the expanded format on the competitiveness and interest in the tournament.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively encourages a more constructive and respectful discussion by suggesting a focus on specific teams or scenarios rather than making broad generalizations. It maintains neutrality and promotes civility without taking sides, which is appropriate for a steering message.",
