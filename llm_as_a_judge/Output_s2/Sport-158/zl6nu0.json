        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the debate, recognizing that both sides have valid points about the nature of rooting for a team. It provides a balanced view by suggesting that the criticism of Unfair_Conference_73's stance is more extreme, while also acknowledging the right to support a team other than one's own. This shows some level of fairness and neutrality.",

        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced perspective, acknowledging that people can support different teams and still be respectful.
