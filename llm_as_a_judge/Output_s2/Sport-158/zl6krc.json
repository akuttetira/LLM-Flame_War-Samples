        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the nuanced debate around the goal's simplicity and the use of adjectives, recognizing that both sides have valid perspectives. It avoids taking a definitive stance on which side is correct and instead highlights the complexity of the discussion.",

    },
    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to steer the conversation towards a more positive and neutral direction by acknowledging Messi's status as a legend and the goal's coolness. It also suggests shifting focus to language and sports commentary, which helps de-escalate the debate. However, it is somewhat vague and does not directly address the underlying disagreement about the goal's 'incredible' nature. The score reflects a moderate effort to maintain neutrality and encourage constructive dialogue.",
