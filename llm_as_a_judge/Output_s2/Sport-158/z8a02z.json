    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument about the US victory in the War of Independence being relevant to modern-day British people is more defensible. It also acknowledges the use of personal attacks and inflammatory language by some posters, which is a fair assessment of the conversation. The mediation is neutral, effective in guiding the discussion towards a more constructive direction, and provides a balanced judgment.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a constructive and neutral approach to guide the conversation back to a respectful and focused discussion about historical context. It avoids taking sides and encourages a more civil exchange by asking for specific aspects of the War of Independence that are relevant today. This helps steer the conversation away from personal attacks and towards a more productive dialogue.",
