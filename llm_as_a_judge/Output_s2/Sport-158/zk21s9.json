        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the argument that Croatia's success is due to their strong team play and strategy, which is a fair and balanced assessment. It also addresses the criticism of being 'cowardly' by suggesting that relying on PKs might be a tactical choice rather than a lack of courage. The score reflects a reasonable attempt to balance both sides of the argument.",
