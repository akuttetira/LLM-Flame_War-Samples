        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the differing perspectives, recognizing that some view the action as a minor annoyance while others see it as disrespectful. It provides a balanced judgment, giving more credit to those who see it as a minor issue rather than a display of disrespect. However, it doesn't fully address the underlying issue of cultural norms and respect in sports.",
