    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the debate by recognizing that Pele's achievements are context-dependent and that the argument about non-competitive leagues is more compelling. It also addresses the era-specific nature of the comparison between Pele and Messi, which is a fair and balanced approach. The score reflects the mediation's ability to fairly assess the arguments presented without taking a definitive stance on who is the GOAT.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively steers the conversation back to the core topic of football skills and accomplishments, acknowledging the debate around different eras but focusing on the actual football performance. It promotes a more neutral and nuanced discussion without taking sides.",
