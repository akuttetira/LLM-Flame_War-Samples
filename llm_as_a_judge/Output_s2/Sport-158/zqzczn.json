    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance the arguments presented, acknowledging both the concern about forced LGBT agendas and the cultural/religious resistance. However, it doesn't fully address the underlying issues of hypocrisy, bias, and the context of the World Cup costs. The score reflects a moderate evaluation of the mediation's attempt to remain neutral but its limited depth in addressing the complex issues at hand.",
        "score": 3
    },
    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively addresses the issue of loaded language and personal attacks, encouraging a more focused and respectful discussion. It promotes a neutral approach by suggesting a shift towards specific issues rather than assumptions about motivations or identities. This is a fair and constructive way to steer the conversation towards a more productive direction.",
        "score": 5
