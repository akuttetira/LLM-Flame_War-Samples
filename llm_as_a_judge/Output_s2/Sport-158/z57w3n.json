        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the concern about referee impartiality due to potential corruption, which is a valid and important issue. It also recognizes the broader context of corruption in sports, which adds depth to the discussion. However, it does not fully address the opposing viewpoint that the focus should remain on the football match itself. The score reflects a balanced consideration of both perspectives.",
