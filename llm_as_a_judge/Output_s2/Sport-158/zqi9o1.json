        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to address the conflict by distinguishing between reasonable protection and calls for physical harm or humiliation. It acknowledges the situation but does not fully resolve the underlying tensions or provide a clear path for resolution. The score reflects a moderate level of fairness and neutrality.",

        "rationale": "The mediation provides a neutral direction to shift the focus from the individual to the event itself, encouraging a more constructive discussion. It avoids taking sides and promotes a balanced perspective, which is appropriate for a steering message in this context.",
