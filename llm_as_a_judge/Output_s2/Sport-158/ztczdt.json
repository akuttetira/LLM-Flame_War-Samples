        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the defense of the handmade card as a genuine expression of admiration is more justified. The criticism of 'dickriding' is dismissive and lacks nuance, while the defense acknowledges the creative intent behind the card. The judgement reflects a fair assessment of the arguments presented.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to shift the focus from the criticism of the author's intentions to the art itself, which is a fair and neutral approach. It encourages a more constructive conversation by inviting the participants to share their own creations or opinions about the card. However, it could have been more direct in addressing the underlying issue of the negative comments made about the author's inspiration.",
