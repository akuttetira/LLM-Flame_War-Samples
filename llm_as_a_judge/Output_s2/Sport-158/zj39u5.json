        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the argument that Croatia's draw-heavy group stage performance suggests a 'group of death', while also addressing the counterpoint that their strategy may not be optimal. It provides a balanced view by not fully endorsing either side but leaning slightly towards the first argument. The reasoning is fair and considers both perspectives.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the discussion about Croatia's strategy and results, while steering the conversation towards a more constructive discussion about team success. It balances the perspectives presented in the conversation and encourages a more analytical discussion rather than a purely opinion-based one.",
