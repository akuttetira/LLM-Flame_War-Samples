        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance the argument by acknowledging the US team's potential growth but also notes the perception of inferiority. However, it doesn't fully address the underlying tensions and personal attacks in the conversation, and the score is somewhat ambiguous.",

        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the passion and disagreement in the conversation, and offers a balanced perspective that neither side is entirely correct. It suggests a neutral interpretation of the game result and acknowledges England's performance as solid. This approach is fair and effective in steering the conversation towards a more constructive direction.",
