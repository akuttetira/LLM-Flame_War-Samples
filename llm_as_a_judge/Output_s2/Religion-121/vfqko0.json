        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of interpreting biblical texts and the historical context of Christian beliefs regarding the Noah's Flood. It recognizes that different Christian traditions have varied interpretations, and the discussion highlights the nuanced nature of religious texts. The judgment is balanced, neither fully endorsing nor dismissing the literal interpretation, but rather acknowledging the depth of the discussion.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively shifts the focus from the debate over the literal interpretation of the flood to a more constructive discussion about the broader themes of patience and repentance in the context of the passage. It encourages a reflective and meaningful conversation rather than getting entrenched in historical or doctrinal disputes. The steering is neutral, fair, and aims to guide the conversation towards a more productive direction.",
