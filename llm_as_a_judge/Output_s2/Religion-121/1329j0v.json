    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance both perspectives by acknowledging the cultural context and the validity of Hadith studies, while also addressing the ethical concerns raised. However, it leans slightly more towards defending the cultural justification, which may not fully address the ethical implications of the historical event. The score reflects a moderate assessment of the mediation's fairness and neutrality.",
        "score": 3
    },
    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively addresses the core issue by focusing on the serious nature of a 9-year-old being married to a 53-year-old, which is a sensitive and inappropriate topic. It also encourages a respectful discussion without personal attacks or gaslighting, which is crucial for maintaining a constructive dialogue. The response is fair, neutral, and highlights the importance of ethical considerations beyond historical or religious contexts.",
