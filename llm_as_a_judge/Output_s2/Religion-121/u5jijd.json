    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument suggesting atheists are doomed without divine intervention is more aligned with the religious perspective presented, while the counterargument about God's omniscience is challenged as a strawman. The judgement acknowledges the religious viewpoint but does not fully address the logical inconsistencies in the claim about eternal damnation without divine guidance. The score reflects a moderate evaluation of the mediation's fairness and effectiveness.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the heated tone of the conversation and suggests a more constructive approach by focusing on arguments rather than personal attacks. It also introduces a neutral perspective by highlighting the difference in viewpoints between faith and reason, which can help guide the discussion towards a more respectful and productive direction.",
