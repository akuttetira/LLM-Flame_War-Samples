    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the opposing viewpoints but leans towards the argument that the 72 virgins concept is misogynistic and oppressive, which is a valid perspective considering the potential implications for women. However, it doesn't fully address the theological and cultural context of the concept within Islam, nor does it provide a balanced evaluation of both sides. The score reflects a moderate assessment of the mediation's fairness and neutrality.",

    },
    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively steers the conversation towards a more neutral and focused discussion by addressing the specific topic of martyrdom and its relation to the afterlife, while encouraging participants to avoid personal attacks and inflammatory language. It promotes a constructive dialogue without taking sides or making assumptions about the authors' intentions.",
