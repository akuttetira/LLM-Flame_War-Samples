    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument about the existence of multiple religions challenging the concept of a single, all-knowing God is more relevant and compelling than the personal attacks and ad hominem arguments. It provides a balanced perspective by acknowledging the strength of the religious pluralism argument while dismissing the offensive and unproductive personal attacks.",
        "score": 5
    },
    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively steers the conversation back to the original topic of religious diversity and the concept of a single God, while addressing the need for respectful discourse. It discourages personal attacks and misrepresentation, which are present in the conversation. The mediation is fair, neutral, and helpful in maintaining a constructive discussion.",
