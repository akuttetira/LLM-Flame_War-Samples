        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the discussion around hell and biblical interpretations, recognizing valid points on both sides. It avoids taking a definitive stance on the correctness of either viewpoint, which is appropriate given the theological and interpretive nature of the topic. However, it could have been more specific in addressing the nuances of the debate.",
