        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the issue by recognizing both the argument against restricting head coverings and the argument that such restrictions are sexist and oppressive. It provides a balanced perspective without taking a clear side, which is fair and neutral. However, it could have been more detailed in explaining why one side is more problematic.",
        "score": 4
    },
    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively steers the conversation back to the central issue of the head scarf while acknowledging valid concerns about objectification and distraction. It promotes a balanced perspective by suggesting that restricting head coverings may not be the most effective or fair solution. The approach is neutral, fair, and encourages a more constructive dialogue.",
