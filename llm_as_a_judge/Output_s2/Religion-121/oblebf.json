        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies the flaw in the argument that religious popularity is evidence of validity, pointing out that such an argument assumes a god would necessarily make itself known to everyone. It provides a balanced perspective by acknowledging that the other side's argument is not entirely without merit but is ultimately flawed. The reasoning is clear and fair, though it could have been more detailed in explaining the nuances of the debate.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to steer the conversation towards a more neutral and constructive direction by focusing on the subjective experience of faith. However, it lacks specific guidance on the original debate about the relationship between religious prevalence and validity. The response is somewhat vague and does not directly address the key points of contention between the participants.",
