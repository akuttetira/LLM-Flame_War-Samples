    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument against God's benevolence allowing evil is more defensible, as it addresses the core issue of moral responsibility and the nature of evil. The discussion revolves around the problem of evil and the tension between free will and divine benevolence, with the mediation accurately highlighting the stronger case for the former. The score reflects the fairness and accuracy of the judgment in this complex philosophical debate.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a neutral perspective that encourages focusing on creating a better world rather than getting stuck in debates about God's nature. It acknowledges the complexity of the issue without taking sides, which is fair and effective. However, it could have been more specific in guiding the conversation towards constructive discussion.",
