        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the personal account of the individual claiming to be possessed by an external force, while also recognizing the lack of conclusive evidence. It balances the perspective of the claimant with the skepticism of the other party, suggesting that the claimant's experience is more compelling without dismissing the need for further evidence. This shows a fair and neutral approach to the discussion.",

        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced perspective, acknowledging the complexity of the discussion and the different viewpoints presented. It encourages exploration of multiple explanations without taking sides, which is fair and effective in a debate context. The message is neutral and aims to facilitate understanding rather than resolve the dispute definitively.",
