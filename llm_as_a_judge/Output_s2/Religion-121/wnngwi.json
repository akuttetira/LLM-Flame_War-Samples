    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the person questioning the morality of child marriage and the Prophet's actions is more in the right, as the discussion revolves around the ethical implications of historical actions in modern contexts. The mediation acknowledges the moral concerns raised about child marriage and the Prophet's actions, while also addressing the counterargument of cultural relativism. However, the mediation could have been more neutral by not explicitly favoring one side over the other without providing balanced evidence.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively addresses the issue by encouraging a focus on specific topics (age of Aisha and child marriage) and discouraging personal attacks. It maintains neutrality and fairness by acknowledging both sides' perspectives without taking a side. The message is clear and constructive, aiming to steer the conversation towards more productive dialogue.",
