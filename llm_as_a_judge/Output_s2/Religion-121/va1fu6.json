        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the debate, recognizing both the religious tradition aspect and the health concerns. However, it leans slightly towards defending the religious argument while downplaying the trauma and health concerns, which may not fully capture the nuanced and controversial nature of the discussion. The score reflects a moderate evaluation of the mediation's fairness and balance.",

    },
    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively steers the conversation towards factual discussion by highlighting the disputed health benefits of circumcision and encouraging a focus on science over personal attacks or cultural assumptions. It promotes neutrality and fairness by acknowledging the historical context while urging a more evidence-based approach.",
