        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the debate, recognizing both sides' arguments. It provides a balanced assessment by suggesting that the medical procedure argument has more defensibility, which is a fair and neutral evaluation of the discussion. However, it does not fully address the ethical and psychological concerns raised by the other side, which could have made the judgment more comprehensive.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the strong emotions and differing viewpoints in the conversation, while encouraging a more objective and factual discussion. It promotes a constructive approach by suggesting a focus on the topic's factual aspects and potential consequences rather than personal attacks or assumptions. This helps to steer the conversation towards a more neutral and productive direction.",
