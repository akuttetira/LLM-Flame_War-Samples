    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to evaluate the argument about biblical condemnation of homosexuality versus the claim that supporting LGBTQ+ rights betrays Christian faith. However, it does not provide a balanced analysis of the religious, theological, and contextual arguments presented in the conversation. It also fails to address the nuances of the debate, such as the interpretation of scripture, the role of context, and the diversity of Christian beliefs. The score is low because the mediation is not neutral or comprehensive.",

        "rationale": "The mediation provides a neutral and constructive approach to de-escalate the heated discussion by focusing on specific texts and arguments rather than personal attacks. It encourages participants to stay on topic and respect each other's beliefs, which is fair and effective.",
