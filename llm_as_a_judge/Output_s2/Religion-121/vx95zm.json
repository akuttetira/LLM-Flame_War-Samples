        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the discussion and the nuances between definitions of 'supernatural,' rather than taking a definitive stance. It avoids reinforcing a binary view and instead highlights the broader, more interesting aspects of the debate. However, it doesn't fully resolve the core disagreement about the definition and provability of the supernatural.",

        "rationale": "The mediation suggests exploring examples like dark matter to add depth, which is a constructive approach. It acknowledges the complexity of the topic and encourages further discussion without taking sides. However, it doesn't directly address the core disagreement about the definition of 'supernatural' or the implications of the term. The score reflects the mediation's effort to guide the conversation towards a more informed discussion.",
