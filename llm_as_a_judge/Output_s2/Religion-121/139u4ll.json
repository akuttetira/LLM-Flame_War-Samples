        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the passionate stance of the person questioning evolution and the Bible, while suggesting they may be misinformed. It provides a balanced view by recognizing the scientific consensus on evolution and the Bible's historical context, without directly labeling one side as correct. However, it leans slightly towards the scientific perspective, which may not fully capture the complexity of the debate.",
