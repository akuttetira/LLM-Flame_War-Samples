        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of suicidal ideation and the potential harm of dismissive responses, while also recognizing the initial point about the church's role. It provides a balanced view by highlighting the hurtfulness of dismissing emotional impact and the unhelpfulness of blaming the person for not being able to cope. However, it does not clearly determine which side is correct but rather offers a nuanced perspective.",
