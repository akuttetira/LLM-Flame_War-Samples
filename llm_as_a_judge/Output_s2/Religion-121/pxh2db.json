    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to evaluate the argument between two sides but fails to provide a clear, neutral assessment based on the conversation. The claim that Jesus' sacrifice is unnecessary and that God's existence is questionable is not definitively supported by the conversation, as it involves theological interpretations and personal beliefs. The mediation also does not address the other side's arguments about God's mercy and the necessity of Jesus' sacrifice. The score is low because the mediation is not neutral, does not clearly evaluate the arguments, and lacks a balanced perspective.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively steers the conversation back to the main topic of Jesus' sacrifice and God's existence, while addressing the personal attacks and assumptions in the conversation. It maintains neutrality and encourages a more constructive dialogue.",
