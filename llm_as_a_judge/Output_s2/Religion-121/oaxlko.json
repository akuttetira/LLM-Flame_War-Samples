        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the debate, recognizing that the burden of proof is a valid point in discussions about theistic claims. It also addresses the critique of dismissing theism as unprovable, which is a fair and balanced perspective. The response is neutral and does not take a side in the argument, making it a reasonable and effective mediation.",
