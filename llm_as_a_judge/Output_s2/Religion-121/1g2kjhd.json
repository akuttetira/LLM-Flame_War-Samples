    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to assess the scientific validity of the argument but fails to provide a balanced evaluation. It dismisses the scientific consensus without addressing the specific claims made in the conversation, and it does not fairly represent the opposing viewpoints. The score is low because the mediation is not neutral or effective in resolving the disagreement.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively steers the conversation back to the main topic of the Qur\u2019an\u2019s description of iron, encouraging participants to focus on specific verses or passages. It promotes a more structured and relevant discussion without taking sides or making assertions. The approach is fair, neutral, and helpful in guiding the conversation toward a more productive direction.",
