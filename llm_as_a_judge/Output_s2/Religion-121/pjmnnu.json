        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the issue and recognizes the differing perspectives on fetal rights and state intervention. It provides a balanced assessment by suggesting that the argument for fetal rights is more defensible, which reflects an attempt to maintain neutrality and fairness. However, it does not fully address the ethical and practical debates surrounding abortion, and the score is moderate due to the lack of a comprehensive resolution.",

        "rationale": "The mediation output acknowledges the passionate nature of the debate and suggests focusing on nuances and complexities rather than making sweeping statements. This approach is fair, effective, and neutral, as it encourages a more balanced discussion without taking sides. It provides a constructive direction for the conversation to move forward.",
