    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument for the existence of a higher power based on the lack of clear proof is more defensible than the dismissive and uncivil stance. It acknowledges the validity of the first perspective while critiquing the second for its lack of engagement and civility.",
        "score": 4
    },
    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively steers the conversation back to the main topic by addressing the heated tone and encouraging a focus on ideas rather than personal attacks. It also suggests exploring different arguments, which promotes a more constructive and neutral discussion. The response is fair, neutral, and aims to facilitate a more productive dialogue.",
