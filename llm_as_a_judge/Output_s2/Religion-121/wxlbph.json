    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the issue, recognizing that the Quran's guidance on milk may not account for modern scientific understanding of lactose intolerance. It also addresses the debate around the Quran's infallibility by suggesting that the argument about milk's advice being flawed is more defensible. The mediation is balanced and does not take a clear side but provides a nuanced perspective.",
        "score": 4
    },
    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a constructive and neutral direction for the discussion, encouraging civility and focusing on historical context and scientific evolution. It avoids taking sides and promotes a more productive dialogue by steering the conversation towards understanding the Quran's advice through a broader historical and scientific lens. The response is effective in maintaining a respectful and focused discussion.",
