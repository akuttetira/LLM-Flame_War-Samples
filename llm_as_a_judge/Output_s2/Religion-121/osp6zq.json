        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the moral arguments presented, recognizing that the claim about atheists lacking morality is not well-supported by evidence. It appropriately highlights the difference between anecdotal evidence and empirical observation, which is a fair and balanced approach to the discussion.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the difficulty in understanding each other's perspectives and suggests focusing on specific issues rather than generalizing about entire groups. This approach promotes a more constructive and neutral discussion, encouraging participants to engage with the specific moral questions rather than attacking each other's beliefs. The mediation is fair, effective, and maintains neutrality.",
