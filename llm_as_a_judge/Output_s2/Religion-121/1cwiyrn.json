        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the issue, recognizing that while some Muslims believe Aisha was 9, the argument based on Quranic age requirements and mathematical calculations suggesting she was 17 is more defensible. It also addresses the broader issue of Muslim beliefs without making a blanket judgment about all Muslims, which shows a balanced approach.",
