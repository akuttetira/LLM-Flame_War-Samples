        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the historical context of women's vulnerability and offers a balanced perspective by recognizing the argument about men's libido as more defensible. However, it does not fully address the complexity of the issue, including cultural, religious, and personal reasons for wearing the hijab. The score reflects a moderate evaluation of the mediation's fairness and neutrality.",

        "rationale": "The mediation offers a neutral and open-ended approach to the discussion, aiming to explore the complexities of modesty and its intersection with power dynamics, consent, and respect. It avoids taking sides and encourages a more constructive dialogue.",
