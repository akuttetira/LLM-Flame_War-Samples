    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to address the central issue of whether personal experiences are valid in religious contexts, but it lacks a clear resolution of the conflict between faith and logical evidence. It also fails to acknowledge the complexity of religious beliefs and the role of interpretation. The score is moderate as it touches on the main point but does not fully resolve the disagreement or provide a balanced perspective.",
        "score": 3
    },
    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively shifts the focus to the original claim without engaging in the personal attacks or strawman arguments present in the conversation. It encourages a more constructive discussion about the implications of the claim rather than getting bogged down in theological or personal disagreements.",
