        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the 'aboutness' argument and the difficulty in explaining intentionality in physical terms, while also recognizing the challenges in reducing the mind to purely physical processes. It provides a balanced view by suggesting that the intentionality argument is more defensible, which reflects a fair and nuanced assessment of the debate.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a neutral and encouraging tone, aiming to foster mutual understanding and collaboration between different viewpoints. It acknowledges the complexity of the discussion without taking sides, which is appropriate for a steering message. However, it does not directly address the core philosophical arguments or provide specific guidance on how to move forward in the discussion.",
