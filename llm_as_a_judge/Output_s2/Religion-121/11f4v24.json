        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of interpreting Jesus' teachings and the role of personal experience, which is a balanced approach. It recognizes that the argument for open interpretation is more reasonable than dismissing claims as unverifiable. However, it does not fully address the historical and textual evidence presented in the conversation, nor does it clearly determine which side is more correct based on the provided arguments.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a neutral and constructive approach, encouraging open dialogue and mutual learning. It acknowledges the diversity of perspectives without taking sides, which is fair and effective in fostering a respectful conversation. The message is positive and aims to bridge differences rather than resolve them outright.",
