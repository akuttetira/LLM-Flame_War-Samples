    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the discussion and provides a nuanced perspective, distinguishing between different theological viewpoints. It offers a balanced evaluation by suggesting that the concept of hell as a state of being is more defensible than the idea of God hating those in hell. However, it does not fully resolve the underlying theological debates or provide clear criteria for determining which view is more correct. The score reflects a moderate assessment of the mediation's fairness and effectiveness.",
