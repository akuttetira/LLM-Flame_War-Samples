    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance the argument by acknowledging the logical extremes of some Christian beliefs while also addressing the moral reprehensibility of child sacrifice. However, it oversimplifies the complex ethical and cultural issues at play, particularly the racial and cultural context brought up by KookyAd9074. The score is moderate as the mediation provides a balanced perspective but lacks depth in addressing the full scope of the debate.",
        "score": 3
    },
    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively steers the conversation back to the central topic of the afterlife and the morality of sacrificing one's child, while addressing the escalating personal attacks and emotional tone. It maintains neutrality and encourages a respectful debate without taking sides or enforcing a specific conclusion.",
