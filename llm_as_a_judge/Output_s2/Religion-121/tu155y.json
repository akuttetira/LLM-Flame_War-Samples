    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to evaluate the argument by distinguishing between the defensibility of the Bible's portrayal of God and the claim that Satan is a supreme being. It acknowledges the complexity of the discussion and provides a balanced assessment by recognizing the strengths of one perspective over the other. However, it does not fully address the nuances of the arguments presented, such as the historical and theological context of the claims made. The score reflects a moderate evaluation of the mediation's fairness and effectiveness.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a respectful and neutral approach to guide the conversation towards focusing on specific Bible passages and ideas rather than making broad theological claims. It acknowledges the complexity of the topic and encourages a more nuanced discussion, which is fair and effective in steering the conversation without taking sides.",
