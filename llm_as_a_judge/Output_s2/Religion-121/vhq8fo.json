    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to evaluate the arguments by acknowledging the possibility of moral accountability in the context of hell. However, it oversimplifies the complex theological and philosophical debates presented in the conversation. The judgment is somewhat neutral but lacks depth in addressing the nuances of the arguments, such as the nature of hell, the role of compassion, and the interpretation of biblical texts. The score reflects a moderate assessment of the mediation's fairness and effectiveness.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a fair and neutral approach to guide the conversation towards more constructive engagement. It acknowledges the passion in the discussion and suggests focusing on arguments rather than assumptions or personal attacks. The suggestion to explore the concept of hell more nuancedly is appropriate and encourages a more respectful dialogue.",
