        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies the main issue as the use of presentist interpretations and selective historical evidence, which are central to the debate. It acknowledges the flaws in both sides' arguments without taking a definitive stance on which is more correct, maintaining a neutral and balanced perspective. The score reflects the effectiveness of the mediation in addressing the core issues and promoting a fair discussion.",
