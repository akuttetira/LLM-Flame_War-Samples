    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the issue, recognizing that the medicalization of gender dysphoria can be harmful and that societal norms can be oppressive. It provides a balanced view by acknowledging the harm caused by forced conformity while also recognizing the perspective of those who dismiss the issue. The mediation does not take a clear stance on the morality of same-sex relationships but instead focuses on the ethical implications of societal norms and medicalization.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively shifts the focus to the actual harm and specific examples, which is a constructive approach to address the discussion. It encourages a more nuanced and evidence-based conversation rather than repeating the same claims. The steering is fair, neutral, and aims to improve the quality of the discussion by focusing on concrete examples.",
