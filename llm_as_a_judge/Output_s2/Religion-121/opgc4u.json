    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the person presenting evidence and criticizing others for not taking it seriously is more justified in their stance. The other side dismisses supernatural events in the Bible without providing evidence or justification, which is less defensible. The mediation is fair, effective, and neutral in its assessment.",
        "score": 5

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a neutral, encouraging message that suggests looking into scientific consensus and reputable researchers instead of relying on debunked sources. It avoids taking sides and promotes further research, which is fair and effective.",
