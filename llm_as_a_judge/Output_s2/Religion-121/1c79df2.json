        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the debate, recognizing that evolution is widely accepted as a scientific fact and that theists may hold atheists to a higher standard of evidence. It also addresses the criticism of blanket claims about atheists being biased and creationism being unscientific, which is a fair and balanced approach. The score reflects the mediation's ability to navigate the discussion without taking sides, while acknowledging valid points from both perspectives.",
