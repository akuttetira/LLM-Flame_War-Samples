    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies the issue of misinterpretation and bias in the discussion around Quranic verse 9:29. It highlights the need for a nuanced understanding of Islamic scholarship and historical context, which is essential for resolving the debate. However, it does not explicitly determine which side is correct or provide a clear resolution, which is required for a judgement type. The mediation is fair and neutral but lacks the decisive element needed for a full judgement.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively steers the conversation towards a more neutral and constructive discussion by focusing on the historical context and theological complexities of the Quran and jihad. It avoids personal attacks and encourages a shared understanding, which is fair and helpful for resolving the disagreement.",
