        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument against church funding is more nuanced and defensible, acknowledging the complexity of the issue rather than taking an absolute stance. It provides a balanced view by distinguishing between the tax-exempt status and the potential for corruption, which is a fair and effective approach to the discussion.",

    },
    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the passionate opinions on both sides and attempts to steer the conversation towards a more neutral ground by focusing on the shared goal of providing aid to those in need. It encourages a discussion about the means rather than the ends, which is a fair and balanced approach. The score is high because it promotes constructive dialogue and maintains neutrality.",
