    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to evaluate the debate between the claims that Christianity has had a damaging impact on attitudes towards adultery and that it has been misrepresented in history. It acknowledges the complexity of the issue and provides a balanced perspective by highlighting the compelling nature of the argument against Christianity's impact on adultery. However, the mediation is somewhat vague and does not clearly define the criteria for judging the strength of each claim. It also lacks specific evidence or reasoning to support its conclusion.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively steers the conversation away from personal attacks and focuses on the broader historical and psychological impacts of the ideas discussed. It addresses the core issue of the conversation without taking sides, promoting a more constructive and neutral dialogue.",
