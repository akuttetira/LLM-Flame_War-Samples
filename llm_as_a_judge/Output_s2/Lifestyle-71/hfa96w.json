        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the critics are more accurate in their assessment of Caroline's behavior and motivations, highlighting her inconsistency, lack of clear identity, and potential narcissism. However, it could have been more neutral by acknowledging the complexity of the situation without clearly favoring one side.",
        "score": 4

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively encourages a more constructive and focused discussion by asking the group to separate critique from personal attacks and identify specific points of disagreement. It promotes neutrality and helps the conversation stay on track to address the issues at hand without escalating negativity.",
