        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the user advocating for a context of abuse and dismissing others' concerns as entitled or lazy is more aligned with the sub's purpose and community norms. The original poster's post, while sharing a personal experience, failed to consider the potential negative impact on others in the community. The judgment reflects an understanding of the sub's context and the need for empathy and consideration in discussions.",
