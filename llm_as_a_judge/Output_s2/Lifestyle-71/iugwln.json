        "rationale": "The mediation provides a supportive and empathetic message that encourages solidarity and mutual support among the individuals sharing their experiences. It acknowledges the bravery of sharing personal struggles and emphasizes the importance of not isolating oneself but rather finding support. The message is neutral, non-judgmental, and aligns with the overall tone of the conversation, which is focused on personal experiences and healing.
