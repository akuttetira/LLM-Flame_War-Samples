        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the discussion around conditional love and abusive relationships, recognizing the nuances in the conversation. However, it does not clearly judge which side is correct, which is required for a 'judgement' type. The response is more of a neutral observation than a clear judgment.",

    },
    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively encourages a focus on specific issues and promotes mutual understanding without assumptions.
