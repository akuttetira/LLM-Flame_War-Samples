    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to judge the argument but lacks clarity and fails to address the core issues of privacy, consent, and the ethical implications of releasing personal medical history. It also doesn't provide a balanced perspective on the conversation.",
        "score": 2
    },
    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively steers the conversation back to the central issue of transparency versus privacy. It encourages a constructive discussion about the ethical boundaries of information release, which is fair and neutral. The response is well-structured and promotes a more focused and productive dialogue.",
