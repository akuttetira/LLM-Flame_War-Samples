        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the user's experience of being invalidated by their parent and their connection to broader cultural issues is more nuanced and valid. The other party's dismissive attitude and implication of being overly dramatic undermine the user's experience. The judgment acknowledges the complexity of the situation and the validity of the user's perspective.",
