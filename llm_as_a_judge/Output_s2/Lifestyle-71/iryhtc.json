        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance both sides of the argument but fails to clearly address the ethical and medical concerns raised. It acknowledges the tradition and medical justification but also recognizes the harm, which is a fair approach. However, it does not clearly condemn the practice as abuse or provide a strong stance on the ethical implications, which weakens its effectiveness.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively encourages a respectful and factual discussion by acknowledging the complexity of the issue and promoting a non-confrontational approach. It avoids taking sides and instead focuses on understanding different perspectives without personal attacks. This fosters a constructive dialogue that aligns with the goal of mediation.",
