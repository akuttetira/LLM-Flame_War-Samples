    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the majority of the conversation involves people sharing experiences of being met with kindness and understanding when making mistakes, which aligns with the supportive and empathetic tone of the discussion. The judgement acknowledges the positive responses and contrasts them with dismissive or mocking comments, which is fair and accurate. However, the mediation could have been more neutral by not explicitly stating which side is 'more in the right' without providing a clear standard for judgment.",
