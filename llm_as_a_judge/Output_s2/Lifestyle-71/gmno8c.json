        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the person sharing their experience of overcoming emotional manipulation and controlling behavior from their parents is more in the right. The judgment acknowledges the difficulty of moving out of a controlling environment and validates the struggles described, which is fair and effective. However, it could be more neutral by not explicitly stating one side as 'more in the right' without providing balanced context.",
