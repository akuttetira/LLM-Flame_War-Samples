        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges that both sides have valid points. Those who question the value of giving flowers argue that periods are a normal, non-event and that giving flowers may overemphasize its significance. Those who see it as traumatic argue that the gesture can be comforting for a young child. The mediation strikes a balance by suggesting that the former perspective is more reasonable, which reflects a fair and nuanced assessment of the discussion.",

        "rationale": "The mediation offers a balanced perspective, acknowledging the thought behind the gesture while recognizing differing viewpoints on how to approach the situation. It encourages agreement on the intention behind the gesture without enforcing a specific viewpoint, which is fair and neutral. However, it could have been more inclusive of the broader discussion about the cultural and emotional significance of periods for children.",
