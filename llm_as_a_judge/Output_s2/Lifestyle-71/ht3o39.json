        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the father's possible upbringing and emotional support issues, which adds depth to the discussion. It does not outright dismiss the father's perspective but also does not fully validate the daughter's viewpoint. The balance is somewhat fair, though it leans slightly more towards the father's perspective.",
