    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of narcissistic personality disorder, recognizing that emotional abuse can stem from the abuser's own issues rather than an inherent evil. It also highlights the importance of empathy and understanding in dealing with such situations, which is a balanced and nuanced approach. However, the mediation does not clearly determine which side is correct in the original conversation, which is required for a 'judgement' type. It instead offers a perspective that is more of a guidance than a definitive judgment.",
