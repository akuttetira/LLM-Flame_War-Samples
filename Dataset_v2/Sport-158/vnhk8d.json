However, I think Camavinga possesses the technical abilities to make all the passes, and I think he has shown flashes of play making abilities. As with Vinicius Jr., I think we should let Camavinga develop before we write him off as a replacement option for Modrić or Kroos.",

If they are still young and developing, how could you know they are not creative? Your statement seems to be based solely on the fact that they play less (in case of Camavinga and Valverde)\n\nAlso creative players comes in many different forms, some are good with finding opening with passes, others do it with flair and dribbles, others control the flow of the team from the midfield. How do you know that a smart decision to cut off opponent's flow by cutting off passes are not signs of creativeness? How about Valverde's good game reading that makes him always be at the correct place and time to do both, running towards opponent's weak side, and closing off opponent's attack when defending, aren't these also shows a good creativeness?\n\n\nHell what about Camavinga's pass to Benzema above?",

When I say creative I mean passing ability, not ball progression that valverde and camavinga both excel at.\n\nCamavinga is a box to box midfielder, the only reason anybody is saying otherwise is because we've now spent 100M on another robust midfielder. When I think of creative young midfielders, i think of players like pedri and foden. You are correct camavinga has shown glimpses of creativity, and flair, however having seen him at Rennes, and now at madrid it's clear to me those aren't where his strengths lie. He's a ball carrier like valverde. That doesn't mean he cant improve or become that creative force. Casemiro wasn't an out an out DM at Porto, and look at him now.\n\nYou mentioned KDB as an example of a white dude who was labelled \"creative\" when he was coming up, but what about pogba, or tielemans, or sambi lokonga? None of these guys are white but most people see them as deep lying playmakers.",
