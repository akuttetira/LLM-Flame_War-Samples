Mexico doesn't win because they don't have a strong football culture, they seem to be more interested in other sports so you can't expect them to do better than Argentina (a country obsessed with football). But it has nothing, absolutely nothing to do with the presence or lack of Italians.",

I have a few Mexican friends and they told me that football wasn't a big deal for their country that's why I believed so! Maybe they were the ones who didn't like football lol. Aside from that, Argentina is, by no means, an exception when it comes to corruption and greed. AFA is the worst.\n\nWhat I mean by football culture is having football everywhere, even when there's not a single match nor competition going on... Football will be a topic of discussion. People will find any excuse to play it with any resources they have. Argentines will mourn their dead football legends as if they were some sort of national hero, even greater than a founding father, and they will pray to them as if they were their God. Most kids want to be a football player and they dream about it every night, it is not rare to cross paths with someone who tried and even got into a minor league because a lot of people try it. I don't know if that's the level of football culture that you can find in Mexico, in Argentina it's almost a way of living or even a religion (not my case, but anyone could agree that it applies to a big part of the country lol). And I'm not saying all this with pride, I believe it's unhealthy but it's still reality.\n\nDo you work with this type of football culture in Mexico too? I know that in most of our neighbour's countries it is very similar (nothing knew since Sotuh America is known for its football craze). But Mexico is a lil far away from us for me to know better.\n\nWhen you have this level of intense devotion to football, corruption and lack of resources (or the bad management of them) can't always stop you. AFA was never a good example, they have been historically questionable, yet that never stopped Argentina from winning 3 times.\n\nOf course, if AFA had been better, maybe we would have more titles. So I understand why that makes it feel that corruption and greed is the reason why Mexico can't progress in football. But the level of issues that Mexican football has can't be the consequence of only one thing. I still think that the culture has some influence (the more people that try to be football players, the higher chances you have of finding a good player) and also the fact that the teams which Mexico plays usually against with are not so strong. I hope that Mexico gets the chance to play in Copa América, it's a more competitive competition and it would actually prepare the team for a better World cup!",

Only 7 out of 26 had italian surnames.\nIn the 1978 squad only 5 out of 22 had italian surnames.\nAnd if you take a look of many of our players with italian surnames like Maradona or Di María you'll realize they're clearly of mixed race, with evident native blood in the mix.\nPlus, if italian blood had something to do then how comes Italy never had a player like Maradona or Messi. Italy of course had great players but nothing like those two, not only in talent but in style as well. Which shows blood had little to do but more football culture and learning a style that is completely south american.\nArgentina has had great players with surnames from other backgrounds as well, British (Houseman, Brown, MacAllister), Greek (Kempes), German (Heinze), Polish (Dybala), etc.\n\nOf course italian surnames are prevalent behind spanish ones, but it is not the reason Argentina is good at football, since as I said previously, Argentina has produced great football players from almost all the ethnic groups that have come here or were already here.\nThe reason Argentina is good and Mexico isn't is simply football development, which includes grassroots, coaches, scout systems, etc. Football culture also plays a big factor obviously, football is also popular in Mexico and other parts of the Americas but Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay are simply something else, it's not an entertainment but a lifestyle in these three countries.",
