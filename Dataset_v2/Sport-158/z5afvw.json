So no matter how many people who come from places like Syria or even Yemen, they're not treated as refugees. In the Syrian refugees case, Syrians who were already in Saudi were allowed to bring in their families and would get free healthcare and education, including enrollments in Saudi colleges. But yeah since we don't have a refugee system, they don't count obviously.",
