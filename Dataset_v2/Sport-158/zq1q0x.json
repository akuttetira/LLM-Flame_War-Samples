Thank you, Argentina for sharing your happiness with the Whole world.\n\nSo many countries love Argentinan Team and cheer them all the way to the World Championship.  No one has seen anything like this fantastic moment on the planet.\n\nAnd yes, Thank you Messi for so many unbelievable moments.",

The whole World has been madly in love with Football from Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, or any South American country. Well before  Messi was even born, many countries were crazy for 1970 Brazil, and in 1986 Argentina. No one cares for any Euro-bore football especially horrible and the most BORING Bootball Crapola (BBC) from England. No matter what they Brainwash the world, no one is buying it. OK maybe some ugly Anglophiles in the U.S.",

I’m not hating on Argentina, it just is what it is.\n\nEverybody loved the Golden State Warriors until they won their championship.\n\nIf you’re talking about young fans who will forever stick to the team of their childhood and this was their first World Cup then maybe. The older fans who were rooting for someone else four years ago will move on.",
