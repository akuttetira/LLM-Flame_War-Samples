These broad statements that are very untrue are spreading the same xenophobia, ignorance and malice that is considered stereotypical of western view of the region, and doesn’t help recognize and encourage the progress that it has made. The same ignorance that I’m sure you’ve argued against when you must have seen Islamophobia on various subs before.",

So I'm not being an apologist here. The punishment for rape in Islam is death for the man. The problem I believe is with the evidence requirement. If there is no sufficient evidence of the attack part of rape, then the state considers the case as that of sex between unmarried adults. Which is what the women fled. The same punishment would have been inflicted on the male perpetrator as well. Lots of things to debate in just these above sentences, but I just wanted to bring some nuance into the discussion.",
