In the Euros you have teams like Georgia, Albania, Romania, Scotland which wouldn't compete against Japan, Ecuador or Morocco. Even Costa Rica or the US have left european teams out of group stages! Imagine the \"best\" tournament not having Salah, Hakimi, Son or the likes of Eto'o, Suarez, Mane, Drogba, Park, Alexis Sanchez...\n\nThere's no concentration of football talent at national level like in the world cup. That's just a fact.",
