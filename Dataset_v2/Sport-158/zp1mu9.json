    "post_text ": "Argentina playing an excellent game, maybe even better than against Croacia. France didn't show up today.\n\nThose saying Argentina is buying the cup know nothing of football\n\nEdit: Some saying this aged poorly.  I think the contrary. This game was proof that Argentina didn't buy it. France woke up at minute 75 and gave a great game.\n\nBest final ever.",
