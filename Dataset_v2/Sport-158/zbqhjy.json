I believe they even have a chance against Brazil. I mean, there's only an estimated 13% chance we could beat Denmark. And you know what, Australia won. There's only 5% chance of us beating Argentina, but we came  much closer than anybody expected us to from beating them. Japan is the most underrated team in the cup. I personally root for South Korea. It's so nice to sea East Asians finally have a shot at the cup.",

And as long as whoever plays CB with Gvardiol doesn't completely blow it, our defence is looking fine. We also have good, tall 9s who can keep the ball and tie both CBs to themselves, which was a problem for Japan when they were playing against Spain (Morata). Which is why I believe Japan don't really stand a chance, they surprised against Spain and Germany but luck eventually does run out and 18% ball possesion and a win is most definitely luck.\n\nBut if anyone were to beat us, I hope it's Japan. Always rooting for the underdogs, and I can't deny that it would be extremely humorous if Korea and Japan meet in QF haha",
