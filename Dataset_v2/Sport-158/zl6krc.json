He got in the penalty box, at which point the defenders are on egg shells not to foul him.\n\nThen he passed the ball past the keeper, in what we used to call a 'dew goal' in my youth because it's just a bit too easy.\n\nI know he's incredibly talented but c'mon. Myths create legends and vice versa.",
