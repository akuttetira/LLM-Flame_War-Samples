I'm sure Messi is great at his job but the fact that this feat is considered astonishing and he still didn't score is lame.\n\nThis is the equivalent of a 50 yard run down to the goal line ending in a fumble and turnover lol",

American Football and American sports in general favor the capitalistic drive of America with advertising etc… American sports are more for profit than the actual sport, they are selling a product and the product is socializing/event. In America everybody watches the Super Bowl, and I am willing to bet 95% of the people watching don’t even understand the game itself, or can name 5 players in the roster. So moral of the story, just because American culture has indoctrinated Americans from a young age to like certain sports to squeeze profit out of you doesn’t make European football less entertaining, you just don’t understand the game. Notice how the World Cup doesn’t have cheerleaders, fantasy league no bullshit distractions etc.. rest of the world appreciates the game for the game itself unlike American sports",

Here in the US soccer is mainly reserved for housholds where moms don't want their kids to be injured in sports. They're called soccer moms and it is a thing, Google it. There is truth behind it especially comparing American football to soccer, soccer is an absurdly safe sport. Skillwise...there's not a single person on a world cup team that could play QB at the professional level. Soccer players who decide to play American football end up as the teams kicker, as that's the only applicable skill that carries over",

Too many middle class household kids playing for an “extracurricular activity”. Being safe has nothing to do with anything, kids play at a young age as well because of access, there are no where near as many little leagues for football compared to soccer because the logistics of setting up a team for American football is a lot harder, you need like 100 kids for one team.  In case you haven’t noticed, soccer players don’t need to use there hands to have the skills to throw balls, that’s like comparing a golf player to a swimmer. And you just proved a point, soccer players have and can play football, where there has literally never been a football player that has been able to play soccer. The learning curve and skill set is alot higher to enter. Whereas a soccer player can just enter and kick a ball into the field goal, says alot about the sport.",
