According to WorldAtlas it goes Football, Cricket, Hockey, Tennis, Volleyball, Table Tennis, Basketball, Baseball, Rugby, Golf. Other sources corroborate that order too. Don’t think it’s accurate to say that America dominates most of those like you said in your original comment. You dominate basketball and baseball, hockey figures generally include both ice and field variants of which you dominate the former but not the latter, you probably dominate golf as well but not to the same extent as basketball or baseball.\n\nBut football, cricket, tennis, volleyball, table tennis and rugby you definitely don’t dominate.",
