If it happens in a cup competition, it is sometimes referred to as a \"cupset\" (a portmanteau, combining the words \"cup\" and \"upset\"). It is often used in reference to beating the betting odds in sports, or beating the opinion polls in electoral politics.\n\n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/worldcup/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",
