Rakitic and Messi played on Barca and Messi ignored him too. That wasn’t classy at all. It has nothing to do with Western media at all. Just what I saw with my own eyes.\n\nHence I said “by the looks of it Argentina can too”, meaning that I’ve changed my mind since then, and also people and circumstances can change. Today Argentina showed more class than they did in 2018 and I am simply pointing out that they are capable of it, and I notice a big difference since before. Nothing is backhanded, and I meant the compliment about the team, if not I wouldn’t have commented\n\nI don’t think I’d have to be explaining a well meaning comment that much but jesus people are so sensitive.",

Besides probably in Croatia losing 3-0 isn't a big deal since football probably isn't almost a live or die thing like its here, so it makes sense that after failing that drastically against an apparent underdog it was so devastating there was no space for acting like a gentleman. They knew media was going to rip them apart, and in those situations you don't give a fuck. Besides, this is my opinion, but 'class' is overrated. Everyone is entitled to act how the fuck they want and shake hands with who they want in that precise moment. The whole idea is to win the world cup, that's it. Being a british gentleman and adopting moral standards has never been my concern. What i do advocate for is no hatred, but no one owes greetings nor 'class' to anyone IMO.",
