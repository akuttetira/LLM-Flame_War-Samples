The 2014 semi's means nothing in the big scheme. 😂 And that's not gonna change any time soon. You can't run away from the facts.\n\nIt must be sad to get attached to a single bad game thinking that this will erase all the trajectory and tradition of Brazil in the sport. You're probably a frustrated European.",

They may be the best historical world cup team, but they also suffered the most famous best down in the history of all sports... at home, 7-1, complete breakdown, tears nearly flooding the stadium. It's beautiful.\n\nI'm not saying Brazil isn't a good team and that they don't have a great world cup history. I'm saying fuck them. Fuck their cocky dancing. Fuck their machismo culture. Fuck Neymar, the bolsonaro supporting homophobe crybaby.",

Yeah, fuck Bolsonaro, fuck homophobia and fuck sexism, lots of us know that he sucks, as shown by the election results, but him sucking doesn't give you the right to patronize us and generalize an entire country lmao.\n\n\nDo you cheer against the USA because of their imperialist actions? Do you cheer against Europe because of their imperialism and colonialist past? I think you don't, do you? Cause you don't see them as an inferior people you have to teach how to become better, that's why I said you have a white savior complex, really simple\n\n\nAlso, misreading a part of our culture (celebrating goals) as disrespectful and attacking us because of that just further proves my point.\n\n\nBTW machismo is present in football all around the world (maybe with the expection of the USA, cause there football is considered a \"women's game\", but whatever) justifying your prejudice against Brazil with that excuse is really pathetic",
