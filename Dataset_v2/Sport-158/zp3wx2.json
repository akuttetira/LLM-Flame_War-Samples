Ref called correctly, VAR didn't intervene, all commentators, pundits and experts are saying the same thing. Clear penalty. You're just biased. If Otamendi got a red, Rabiot should've gotten a red in first half as well. Neither got a red, which is also fine",

Also France we’re awarded more penalties than Argentina so I’m not sure how it was rigged against them.",

France should have studied penalties more. Also I’m sensing that if it had been France that won in the manner that Argentina did today then you would have had no issues, I may be wrong but this is the vibe I’m getting. I’m an Australian and we lost to both France and Argentina 2-1 so there’s no bias on my side.",
