The key difference is that Americans are just trolling for a reaction.\n\nLots of Europeans seem to get offended that Americans don't revere the sport, so they misinterpret \"soccer\" as being an intentionally demeaning word.\n\nA lot of countries like the sport and call it soccer, Canadians and Australians, for example.\n\nEdit: keep downvoting. There have been literal books written about this. It has always been the other way around. People who call it soccer aren't the ones correcting people IRL. This is a joke response to troll butthurt Europeans. https://youtu.be/Ld5pfFrPBVE",

Wanna talk about inferiority complex yet you lot can never take a joke. Sorry you cant handle a little banter my friend, good luck in 4 years.",
