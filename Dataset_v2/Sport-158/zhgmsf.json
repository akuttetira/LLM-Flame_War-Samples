Ok, like 30 seconds before paredes commits the foul and shots the ball to the bench, ake committed that exact same foul, that deserved a yellow, and it wasn't even called. Vvd should've been sent off, same for gapko dumfries and timber. And 10 minutes just so the Dutch could tie the game. You're the blind one bud. Need to learn more about the game.",

There were a bunch of riots on the field.\n\nEven without the constant diving and faking of injuries how is 10 minutes so strange? We have seen plenty matches this WC that got more and didn't have all the above mentioned factors.\n\nActual playtime wasn't that much even with those 10 minutes extra time.",
