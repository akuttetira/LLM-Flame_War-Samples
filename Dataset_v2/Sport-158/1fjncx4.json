There’s zero risk/reward so why bother? Teams will either put out weakened sides or just half arse it and that’s what will happen here.",

Just to put that into perspective: That's roughly what the clubs get if they win the austrian league. The whole fkin league, and they can earn as much on a single evening, up to eight times. It will be similarly important for all other small clubs, smaller leagues or clubs who are on a run like Atalanta, Girona or Leverkusen.\n\nMost of the teams will always be motivated to give their best, because it can make a 16 million euro difference on their bankroll, out of which parts will make it to the players in form of bonuses.\n\nI'm not sure how the table will develop, but there should still be attractive football being played up until the last day.",

It doesn't matter where they are positioned in the table, they will still support their team no matter what. Best examples for this are teams like Union Berlin last season.\n\nThen you have casual fans, who only care about good and decisive games. While the amount of games that will be interesting for those will definitely decrease towards the end of the groupstage.. it will never drop to 0. There are more than 8 good teams who want to fight for the top 8 spots.\n\nSo I don't really know where you are coming from. Of course the median experience will \"decrease\", simply because you have more games now, but that doesn't mean that the peak level changes.\n\nPeople *will* be interested in seeing who will top the table, and that team will have a strong character arc which will pull even more viewers into the knock-out stages. Imagine the marketing you can do around a team that beats everyone, or in an even better case wins all games/remains unbeaten throughout the league stage and is being hunted now by the rest of europe.\n\nImo you're focusing way too much on the bottom end, but that's not where this competition takes place.",

There will still be a few instances of \"6 pointers\" where two teams who are relatively close to one another in the table play each other later in the schedule.

I imagine the top 8 won’t have to play each other in the last 16 just to make sure they really crush the magic of cup competitions in favour of the rich clubs.",

In the current format big teams often play their backups the final 1-2 games too.\n\nOf course real life is not a computer game, but at least just from a numbers standpoint, getting top 8 is harder than it might seem at first.",
