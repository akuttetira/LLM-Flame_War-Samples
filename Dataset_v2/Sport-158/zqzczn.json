There’s no profit, just waste of resources that mankind could’ve used for something else.\n\nAs for your resistance to LGBT, it sadly says a lot about you and people like you. Imagine if blonde Germans were to lash out against Mosques being built in their country and use your rhetoric against people different from them.\n\nYou live in 2022 not the 5th century.
