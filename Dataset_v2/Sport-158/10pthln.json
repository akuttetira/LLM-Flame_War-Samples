What I see as unnecessary is that van gaal has made those irrelevant statements when it comes to criticizing Messi in vain for not wanting to go looking for the ball.\nFortunately Argentina team had a very good midfield MAC Allister, Enzo Fernández   and De Paul who understand the way Messi plays and they could help Messi during all WC, everybody r impressive and greatfull about the performance of almost all players of Arg team and the way they work to raise the CUP.",

It also makes more sense since his overall influence on the game is waning as he is more a player of big moments. If your able to pressure him like in the Saudi or France matches you can dispossess him and make him a periphery figure as we have seen in PSGs past games.  However, as you said if they didn’t have those stellar midfielders we may be having a different conversation.",

But nothing I said was wrong he has a nonexistent work rate and when adversity set in for example the Saudi and France matches he folded because he was put under pressure. Fortunately the Saudi match had no bearing on the final result and a combination of France simply not taking advantage and emi Martinez heroics helped spare his blushes. There’s a reason the team had to be built around him. He was simply not the same player he was a few years ago. You have to put him in a position to succeed I.e build the team around him. He can’t do everything on his own like he did before his skillset has changed with age and you have to accommodate that.  That’s not a slight on him that’s just what happens when players get older and smart strategy on the coaches part. Also, his skillset alone did not make them win the World Cup they went to multiple penalty shootouts which are a lottery for example. It was a combination of a lot of factors that included more than just one player performing.",

Nothing to be mad about, dude is in his late 30s. Its just an observation. Goalkeeper got asked something in the line of Messi taking a penalty or a shot and he replied with 'well you gotta keep those out too'. Again its taken heavily out of context. He said it in the context of if you want to make it to the final, you have to take Messi's shots aswell. Unfortunately Argentinian media and Messi fans only hear what they want to hear.",
