God forbid we were runner ups in 2018, have all our players play for major EU clubs, and Modric with Ballon D'or and 5 UCL, Perisic with 1, Lovren with 1 and Kovacic with 4. Clearly a coincidence.",

Spain scored 7 goals against Costa Rica, Portugal 6 against Switzerland. Both were shut out by Morocco.\n\nSecond, ultimately what matters is results. Beautiful, attacking football is great to enjoy, but it doesn't give you bonus points in matches. The ugliest, cheapest football I've probably ever seen was Italy in 2006. They won the whole thing and they don't care about what people think of how they did it.",
