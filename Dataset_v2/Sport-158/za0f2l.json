In this case, that Japan clearly only mustered 20% ball possession in 90+ minutes of a match. Cry harder about the numbers, chump. 😭😭😭",

They couldn't penetrate, so they wasted time.",

Where is your objectivity?\n\njapan made the correct adjustments and won 2-1? 2 is greater than 1, just like you said. japan was never going to beat spain in possesion? spanish football is all about holding possession, japans plan from the start was to try and have a solid defence and punish them on the counter and thats what happened vs germany and thats what ended up happening to spain, idk but there are so many games in football where teams with 60%+ possesion lose to counter attacking based teams. people who comment about possesion being the do or die stat of football are the most uniformed football fans that exist and it would seem to be youre one of them.",

So, ultimately, ball possession equates to tiring the other team out, while increasing one's own chances to score as much as possible.",
