Five goals each to Japan and Korea in four matches each.\n\nThe US scored three, Mexico scored two, Costa Rica scored three, and Canada 1. That's nine goals between all CONCACAF teams that have gone home already, and only a mere TWO East-Asian teams outscored them all.",

And I guess 13 assassin's. Outrage is ok. Sonatine is great but you're getting into classics. And the Kurosawa films are great if you are counting a bygone era.",

Trigger with Promare, Madhouse with Redline, an entire bag of Satoshi Kon films, another bag of Makoto Shinkai films, Ufotable just making great animated pieces one after the other with Fate and Demon Slayer, and the list goes on.",
