If you don't then you should sit this one out. Calling a white person monkey has no racist connotations like when a black person is called a monkey.\nThis was a clear-cut case of a racist a-hole playing with words but knowing very well what he was doing. I mean why did he comes out and apologise then?",

Just look at how the fans reacted today calling Vini a monkey and even bringing toy monkeys with them to the stadium. I guess it is true that white people will never understand racism.",
