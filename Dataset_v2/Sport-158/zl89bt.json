Van Gaal always said that Messi is useless without the ball, that Barcelona played with 10 because Messi just walked the field. He always underestimated and talked down south American players and football and put down Riquelme from Barcelona, who's Messi's idol. So he went and made his signature gesture to him, the \"topo Gigio\" hands on ears. He also said that in penalties Argentina had no chance.",

In ARG vs CRO he prevented anything from escalted and showed whos the boss.\n\nIn NED vs ARG ref didnt react and players knew they can do whatever they want. You can say Netherland provoked but the tension is rising when you see ref is doing shit - same on other side. Argentinians acted like they acted because ref didnt punish Neds",

They will keep behaving like little brats and then complain when they get spanked like they deserve.\n\nI guarantee they will pull the same shit with whoever they play on the next world cup.",
