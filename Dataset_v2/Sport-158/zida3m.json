            "Reply_Text": "This was indeed not very cool, but I do think people here look at this one sided. Messi and other players were mocking an emotional van Gaal at the end and I don’t think that is cool at all. I mean, the man has cancer and was painfully denied his biggest dream ever. It was his last game as Dutch coach ever, of his career even. And I know he said things about Argentina and Messi, but every coach says thing about their rival team. I wouldn’t blame the Argentinian coach or player talking about the Dutch team, it is totally okay to criticise the other team. In fact, is a tactic. Mocking an emotional and very sick and old man on the other is not. About the game itself all I can say is: both teams were not being cool and frustration eventally got the best of everyone. Messi should however def have got a yellow for his hands. And the ball shot in the dugout was shitty as well. If you disagree thats okay but please don’t downvote but just comment so we can talk. I think not talking is exactly what went wrong Friday so thank you.",

Van Gaal talked shit about Messi and he’s always been shitty towards southamerican players (hence why Messi celebrated like Riquelme). I don’t care he has cancer, what does that even have to do with anything? Being sick doesn’t absolve you from being a shitty person.\nNetherlands’ players were tough and trash talked (which is fine by) and they recieved the same. You don’t even know what they said to eachother but everyone wants to play the moral high ground, which is sickening honestly",

As always, every time a South American team/player defends itself/ fights back entire Europe ego defaults back to their roots filled with perceived moral superiority and racism. All the time they think its deserved that THEY win, that THEY receive special treatment.\n\nAfter being beaten by an African team what was the first thing the Portugal players said? \"MUH REFEREES ARGENTINIAN THEY WANT US OUT\".When Portugal has been an historic absolute joke of a team who were never considered our rivals in the slightlest.\n\nTired of hearing from Europe how bad we are when they destroyed our land and pillaged every god damn resource we had. Fuck them.",

And I respect you guys a lot for that part, even tough I would have been totally okay if he did talk trash. Furthermore, I don’t think racism has a lot to with this tbh. In this case you are the one calling an entire continent rasicts. Although I understand your frustration, the Portugal Morocco game has very little to do with this. For example, as a European I rooted for Morroco. I really wanted an African country to win. After all it is called a WOLRD cup. I am merely talking about the game and the game alone",

Everyone, especially europeans, calling out Argentina saying they showed bad discipline, provocations, this and that. I think it's racism or discrimination in that people are quick to label south American or non Western countries as \"uncivilized\" or \"Lack of Sportsmanship\". Louis Van Gal talked trash, and when his side won other players talked trash back basically. It unfortunate because I believe Louis Van Gal is a nice old man. But its not out of the ordinary for such a competitive enviroment and players. Argentina has not talked trash about any rivals before a match. Also, nothing said to Van Gal was a personal attack on him. Basically Messi just said \"He talks too much\". There was no personal insult to Van Gal. And Dutch players did what is shown in this clip every single penalty.\n\nBasically both sides showed lack of discipline but everyone blames Argentina. Argentinians are very very proud and this explains there response after match.",

Because from our point of view, everyone is defending Argentina and Messi because is the goat and is treated like a saint most of the times. Personally I think he showed bad showmanship Friday… and I think he did go after van Gaal personally. By standing with his hands behind his ears in front of him and later making mocking hand signals at him. Van Gaal standing there clearly emotional after a devastating night. Also van Gaal I really not a racist. Believe me, he literally kissed one the black players on his head during a press conference. Tbh I am shocked by the allegations, he is really just a nice old man for as far as I can see.",
