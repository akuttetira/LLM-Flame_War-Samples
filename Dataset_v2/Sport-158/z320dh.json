Its as if i was black and i get constant hate because their culture thinks black people shouldn’t exist. Just use 2 brain cells, think for yourself and understand that any type of discrimination masked behind “culture” is utter BS, even so more when you host the most important event worldwide and you are basically forcing the world (with different cultures) to come to your shithole.",

I am against hate but you really targeted a whole country because you can’t take the fact they live how they want, as it is respectably their country and you must follow their rules. If you are tolerant of everything, then you stand for nothing simple as that and what do you know about discrimination?? The LGBTQ community is predominantly white and play a role of oppression in the western countries, and then link their struggles to POC struggles as a way to shield themselves from any criticism. You are a prime example of this by using “black people” as a part of your stupid argument. Football should be apolitical in the first place, mixing it with politics makes non-fans like liberal Americans use this sport as a way to spread their agendas and act like they care about football and Ash Sarkar just proved my point. She’s a LGBTQ activist who had an interview with Piers Morgan about the world cup, and he asked who she is supporting in the world cup…. and her answer was “tottenham” like seriously you can’t make up how fucking stupid that answer was. So fuck off with politics and get a life!! if you care so much about human rights then stop using an iphone you daft cunt",

Mass shootings usually are caused by bullying, involving in many cases of LGBT+ people marginalized. That suffering combined with easy access to guns causes these issues. Thing is you don't care about the trauma this 'shooters' went through, you just care about the final catastrophe which is obviously also a disgrace. But that's exactly an example of what happens when you repress minorities for being \"different\" and spread your hateful beliefs that come from several generations ago. When you try to repress love and how people really are (via bullying, maginalization, hatred, killing, etc) you will just get your hate back all at once. Couple that with easy access to semi automatic weapons and you get this type of shit. Whether you want to use POC, LGBT+ people, or whatever minority out there that seeks love and doesn't harm anyone to say they are 'spreading an agenda' you will always crumble to hate. There is no way around it. And why would i care if a LGBT+ activist knows about football or not. I care about LGBT+ and i probably know more football than you do, but what does that matter. In fact, its better that the target audience of this event isn't LGBT+ related people so that the impact is bigger and we altogether put an end to unnecessary suffering.",

You just want your entertainment and fuck everything else. You just want to see a fraction of the picture, and cover your eyes to all the oppression and suffering caused by this shithole of a country. Its like “just go to work” whilst millions of people face torture and discrimination for being LGBT+. You can’t host a worldwide event pretending everyone to adopt your hate culture. Oh lets just enjoy the games whilst millions of people died from working under unhuman conditions and millions of people commit suicide for being rejected (or even killed) for being LGBT+. That sounds reasonable.",

Why do you think i support WC 2026 being hosted by the US? You are just projecting. Plus school shooting where LGBT+ people are repressed and exploud is proving my whole point which is: Live and let live, and then these thing wouldn't happen. In terms of hypocrisy, you could say the germans are hypocrites due to their Nazi past, that the americans (US) are hypocrites due to their racist past (and to a lesser extent present). That doesn't mean we shouldn't strive towards love, independently of what happened in the past. That's the whole point. Even so when the WC was held in Germany 2006 i didn't see racist and anti LGBT+ laws, nor exploitation of milliones of workers, nor any other BS. \"Real football fan\"? Bruh i can't even see your nationality, in my country football is the main thing, quite unlikely with the amount of football history i have on me. But then again, why would that matter?",
