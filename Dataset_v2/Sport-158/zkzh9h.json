The hive mind just doesn't like something, that doesn't mean im wrong. As in, the hive mind of the world cup wants to pretend they arent supporting rape, murder, and slavery.",

They need to ban USA too for killing *MILLIONS* of people in Iraq, Afghanistan etc and their military who were *RAPING* the women in those countries.\n\nAfter that, they need to ban Argentina for the erasure of black people from its history and much more which explains why argentinian team has no black players.\n\nAfter that, they need to ban Germany for signing a natural resources contract recently with a homophobic, misogynistic country that has done human rights violations (Qatar).\n\nAfter that, they need to ban Saudi Arabia for killing and attacking Yemenis.\n\nAfter that, they need to ban Israel for obvious reason.\n\nDo you want me to go on?",

The numbers have been exaggerated, but I am not trying to say that no one died building the stadiums. Why’re we talking about Qatar, if the Iranian government is shit? Cuz you hate Arabs or The Middle East don’t you? You believe they shouldn’t be able to have a happy moment for once. I wouldn’t be surprised if you came for Qatars neck on a post that criticizes Saudi Arabia or UAE.\n\nPeople died building the Eiffel Tower, the pyramids in Giza, and many more.
