So he can cry and sulk all he wants while the rest of the world rejoices. Great riddance.",

As for the handball and other of his fouls, he was penalized and even _banned_ for them. Not like Maradona, or the serial cheater Sergio Ramos. It's ok to not like Suarez, but the hatred surrounding him is absolutely pathetic.",
