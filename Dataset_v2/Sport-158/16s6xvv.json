On the very last minute of the game, on a very innocent tackle, the ref awarded a barely conceivable penalty, clearly as to compensate the earlier red card. Remember, there was no VAR back then!\nI had bet on a win for Italy as I thought it would have been easy money… never expected it to be so hard. The ref almost fucked it up in full",

Yeah, I guess that’s where sport went to die.\nThat’s also the game where the referee must have felt so ashamed of himself that he conceded a “liberal” penalty to right the earlier wrong… By the way, there was no diving in the box. It was a very normal tackle. The diving had been done earlier.",

Maybe you don’t know how football works, but you are allowed physical contact, even in the box. Not all physical contact must result in a foul.\nAs per wiki: “The central defender had fallen to the ground early and Grosso, though not tripped, was impeded and dived straight over him.” See? No diving. If you ask anyone, not a foul either, but FFS no diving.\n\nYou also seems to overemphasize one wrong that the referee did (the penalty), ignoring the other blatant one he had made earlier. Where, if there was any contact it was “minimal”. As per wiki:  “Italian team shrinking to ten men after Marco Materazzi was shown a controversial straight red card in the 50th minute”.\n\nWhich is the same wording used for the penalty, by the way: “The second disputed referee decision was a penalty kick”",
