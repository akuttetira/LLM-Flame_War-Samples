Everytime we play a football game with friends the winners sings it.\n\nIts a little banter nothing else, the fact they said Mbappé means they know he was the most important player in France.",

If it had been just a good solid team, then I guess we would replace the word Mbappe for \"Japan\" or \"Korea\" or we may simply decide to just... make fun of Brazil LOL.\n\nMbappe did say that he thought European teams were superior to south americans so he pretty much made himself a target for the songs. People here were also upset at him before the world cup because he pushed messi on his team in a match so the memes are targeting him as well. The songs/memes are all in good fun though. No hate, just how we celebrate :)",
