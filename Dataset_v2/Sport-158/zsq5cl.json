Pele played all the top European teams in \"friendlies\" because there was no other way to play them at that time. He once played 19 games in 39 days against Real, Barca, Bayern and others. Scored almost 2 goals per game on average in that span alone. Oh, and FIFA doesn't even count those goals towards his total because they didn't consider those competitive matches. Messi is 2nd and GOAT of the modern era, but Pele is clear #1",
