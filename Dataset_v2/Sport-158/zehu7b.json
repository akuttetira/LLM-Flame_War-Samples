This is a demolition job for France, this is probably the most one sided tie in the quarter finals, France 3-1 England minimum, can easily see it being a higher scoreline. England have one of the worst defences in the tournament, a very average midfield, and also one of the worst managers in the tournament. France are missing key players, that’s true. But it really doesn’t matter one bit, they have enough quality in the squad to send England to the cleaners.",
