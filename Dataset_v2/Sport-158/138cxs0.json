Real won a legendary match that night. Aguero here was supporting the club he played for a decade and was devastated by the loss. Hope this simple equation makes sense to you. Thanks.",

Maybe it’s some of that good old Barca “pride in defeat” mentality.\n\nHe never did anything noteworthy in the Champions league for that matter, you know, the one competition that’s the most prestigious in all of Club Football.\n\nNo problem with him celebrating his country winning the World Cup, hell I’d do that if my country won and I’ve never even played professionally.\n\nThe fact that he walked on the pitch  in kit with a medal around his neck as if he actually did anything was pretty much the football equivalent of stolen valour. Not to mention calling Camavinga who’s a decade and a half younger than him “dickface” for no apparent reason was very trashy.\n\nHowever, I wouldn’t expect a Barca fan to know the difference between classy and trash behaviour.

In that case, we may even come to a conclusion that KdB is a shit player who hasn't won a UCL? I don't think that'd be a proper assessment?\n\nRegarding walking with a medal - ffs it's not like that he stole it or something, maybe his teammates gave him one out of love and camaraderie. Most of them played alongside him, and he suffered a traumatic end to his career - they just did this as an act of support maybe?\n\nHim calling Camavinga that is absolutely vile and pathetic. He needs to keep control of his temperament. Shame on him for that.\n\nJust want a rational football discussion, that's it.
