They played with passion and determination and they weren't arrogant cocky posers like most of the top teams.\n\nTbh a Croatia vs Morocco finale would be great and hilarious. I know it won't happen, but most top teams were horrible in this tournament and they would deserve it.",

So ITS COMPLETELY IMPOSIBLE TO PREDICT A GAME BEFORE HAND. Don't let anyone bullshit you saying 'A' wins 100% against 'B'. Wrong, the best team, even if its superior by a massive margin, only has HIGHER (and the bigger the quality margin the higher) probabilities of winning the game. Its like a middle ground between chess (no luck) and a roulette (100% luck). Besides luck, mentality and motivation (if you are an underdog against a top national team you get advantage here) also plays a big role. So if you are choosing favorites based on how good they are, there is no guarantee they will make it, even if they are the best by far. Will they be the most probable to win the WC? Yes. Will that 1 team win it? most likely not. You just need to go with your home country, and if you lose, just choose whatever culture you reasonate most with.",

Or like you said, whose culture resonates with me most. The US, Canada, Mexico, Germany, Japan, Spain, Brazil, Australia, and now the Netherlands, are all out, so it’s gotten pretty open-ended for me at this point. I might root for Morocco as the only African nation left. Or Argentina since Messi said this’ll be his last WC.
