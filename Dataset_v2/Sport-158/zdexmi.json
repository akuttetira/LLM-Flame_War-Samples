Meanwhile most established industries post 1945 had already been established in Serbia proper then relocated to other states, including Croatia and Slovenia. This is evident in Yugoslavia's [Relocation of Serbian industry during the Informbiro period](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relocation_of_Serbian_industry_during_the_Informbiro_period).\n\nBtw, to argue that Croatia and Slovenia are decades ahead economically to Serbia is a bit of an overstatement. Sure you have an established seaside that caters to tourism, other than that there really isn't all that much in natural resources when compared to Serbia. You're in the EU so there are economic perks that come with that, that's about it. If Serbia had its corruption in check, we wouldn't be really comparing economies.\n\nNot trying to make this out to be a dick measuring contest, just sharing my opinion on the topic.",

Serbia was on the radar of many sports analyst who were probably just as stunned that they perform so bad, just as stunned as the average Serb is. They finished first in qualifiers above Portugal and that was an indicator of their success.. which sadly never came.\n\nI agree though, their performance was a disgrace at this World Cup, yet again.\n\nMark my words, they'll perform well at the upcoming Euro.",
