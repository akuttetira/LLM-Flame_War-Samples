You see the world through your own eyes!\n\nYou probably have forgotten for a second, that this not the reality for an average Argentine citizen, there, they have all kinds of jobs from the bad ones to the good ones and even best ones.And Argentinians rule their country, obviously they don't look down on each outer, the biggest source of discriminatory experience is that of the class warfare (like most other countries). For an Argentine citizen your world seems a bit strange. YOU might see work as undignified. But and Argentinian might see it as source of pride and opportunity.\n\nYou have to open your mind, and realize that you are living in a part of the world, and that part is shaping you mind and experience, and can look much different from the viewpoint of another person.\n\n\nIf France had won, and drone video had been recorded in Paris, you can bet, that I would have comment the same thing \"get back to work\", because it's funny in all cultures.",

Cant I criticise someone like a president because im not one? Cant I criticise some chef's food because im not a chef?What im trying to say is that every group of people can find a joke offensive while others dont, someone from India would find a joke about the death of the queen of england less ofensive than a english man.You gotta understand that some people will find a joke like that offensive due to the situation and how the joke is said.\n\n\nEdit : I remembered that i seen a joke about the world cup (i dont have the link of the joke) that was pretty funny, you can make actually funny jokes about whats going on but not in the way you went about it",

You can't even explain why my comment about employer/employee is racist!?But I can prove its a work joke. because 1/4 of the sentence includes the word work!  \"get back to work\"Now I would like to see you try (and fail) to translate that sentence to a racist joke. Go on! Analyse away! if you don't you're a hypocrite.\n\nAlso, I learnt long time ago, when people accuse you of something that is false or exaggerated without reasonable cause, 9 out of 10 times that mean the accuser is the guilty one. Ergo you are the racist one! Maybe you are just scared shitless that people look down on you and you accuse left and right as a defense mechanism.",

You definitely ignore the history of our region and don't even understand that we still have colonialism problems (you know, something called Malvinas islands). So, your ignorance is an example of how a lot of European and other first world countries completely ignore how many bad things they did in the recent past (e.g. my region had a lot of military coups sponsored by a very specific country), and still don't give a fuck about that.\n\nThe lack of understanding plus the big assumptions you make about my relatives is the final example of how arrogant you are.
