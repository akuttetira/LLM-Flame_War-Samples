My best example is one telling children to honour and respect their parents, that my dad used to read to me without ever mentioning the next part telling fathers to respect their children as well. It's sad because a lot of Christian people use this verse to tell their adult children they can't ever disagree with them because \"it's in the Bible\".\n\nAnd I grew up in a Muslim community, and spent my childhood going to my Moroccan and Tunisian friends' family parties, raiding the buffet, dancing and singing along to every song while probably butchering the Arabic language, so I knew it didn't apply to everyone but was curious about his point of view, thanks for telling me where it comes from!",
