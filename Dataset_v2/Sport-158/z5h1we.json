Messi was playing bit further from usual and there were two players ahead of him, if all of them charge to Messi the other two would’ve got an easy pass.

They were expecting a cross like the last times so they were not marking Messi as much because he was further back and not going to receive cross but they still had 2 defenders near him. But it was too late by the time they closed the distance he already shot.",
