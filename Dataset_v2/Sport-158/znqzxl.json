Not the best team in the tournament, but will finish at least 4th. That is down to togetherness. To achieve that you need leadership.\n\nSport is littered with examples of teams withe best players losing and teams with inferior players winning.",

France exploded in 2010 due to internal conflict making fool of ourselves in the front of the world.\n\nI've leaded teams in the past (and learn it the hard way) and my job now consist of making ppl work together to achieve a common goal.\n\nHis speech his bland cause he goes too much in details instead of keeping it short. He try to address too many things in his speech and everything just melt together.\n\nMessi is an insane footballer, arguably the best so far but from this speech, I don't see any insane leadership skills outside of the pitch.",
