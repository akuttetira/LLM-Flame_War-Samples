Even if he wins the case with easy, it would be too late for anything.\n\nMuricans redditors though as usual ride of drama and build up narratives to demonise people where it was obvious what the case is - Leeches trying to rob some rich and famous guy by trying to blackmail him.  The neverending story basically to get easy money.\n\nToo bad there are too many white knights who support female blackmailers and label anyone they don't like as ''rapist'' ''racist'' ''mysoginist'' or some other fabricated American excuse to trash on people.",
