    "post_text ": "Madison Reeve's Twitter thread about working at LMG: https://twitter.com/suuuoppp/status/1691693740254228741\n\nIn general, it's a good idea to remember that HR is not on your side when it comes to conflicts between you and your employer. They will always side with the company whenever possible.\n\nIt's also important to identify conflicts of interest, such as the HR department being run by the wife of the company's founder and who is also one of the primary shareholders of the company.",

Reddit could literally delete my account rn and i would carry on without a thought (would even have a laugh about it).\n\nEdit: lemme tell sou a secret, i barely read any of the replies only small snipits\n\n![gif](giphy|BPJmthQ3YRwD6QqcVD|downsized)",
