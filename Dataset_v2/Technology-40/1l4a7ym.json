If the best thing you can do is buy bitcoin... well I can do that so why would I pay you to go buy bitcoin and just buy it myself?\n\nIt doesn't make sense for someone to pay someone else a premium to buy and hold bitcoin, at best its a push If youre holding that cash to make acquisitions.\n\nGamestop doesn't make money so it can't really pay a dividend. It just continually dillutes to continue limping along because even if the switch 2 does biblical numbers its not enough to long term change a trend that the industry has been going in for 20 years.\n\nConsole makers love digital sales. The margin is better and they dont have to cut retailers in. They will never want to go back. Never ever. Every kid who buys their first ps5 gets the digital one, and will never buy games in gamestops eco system. Nintendo will probably never phase out physical media BUT is not big eno8gh to keep gamestop solvent when every other retailer is competing.",

All the idiot crypto bros on WSB will be left holding the bag. They've closed a quater of their locations, roughly 1000 stores, since last year, and are continuing to close them. The stores are barren, dirty, and usually staffed by a single employee. Tesla stock is probably safer than Gamestop right now.\n\nI believe Gamestop is also technically like a billion in debt that they're hiding.",

They don't produce cutting edge, their sales is dwindling, their cars are mid-range safety wise, they have nothing exciting in the pipe line, their brand is targeted at fascists/nazi's and globally dispised.

That number will increase based on predictions of medium term growth. NVidia's ~35 odd P/E suggests that people expect their earnings to double in the next few years.\n\nSo for Tesla to 'only' be at 100 suggests a 5 times increase in earnings in the medium term, despite the last year seeing a decrease of ~20%.\n\nIMO Tesla's car market share is likely going to be fairly stable from now as they've lost any first mover advantage. So any increase in growth has to come from new technologies, which currently seem like vapourware.\n\nOn fundamentals alone, I'd but Tesla at a buy after it has lost around 91% of its current value.",
