    "post_text ": "I shan’t bore any of you with a large wall of text that you’ve probably already seen on hundreds of other subs.\n\nIf you’re unaware of the situation, [here is some context](https://imgur.io/E7jSWf1?r).\n\nWe won’t be allowing new submissions in this period in protest of upcoming API changes that will kill your favourite 3rd party Reddit clients. It’s in our best interests as a technology minded community to preserve access to the Reddit API in a way that is cost effective and allows for all of the talented devs who make these apps a reality to continue doing their thing. \n\nYou can help get involved by checking out the resources on /r/Save3rdPartyApps, including [this post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/). \n\nAll the best, and I hope you understand :)",
