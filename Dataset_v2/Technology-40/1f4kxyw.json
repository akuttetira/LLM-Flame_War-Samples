Not sure if it was issues with the transition, medical issues, or whatever (not my business, 100% her business), but I almost figured she left already as we hadn’t seen her in a long time. Wish her luck in future endeavors and hope to see her back as a “guest” on the WAN Show or something.",

The gaming community on the other hand is afraid that sweet baby inc is going to make games woke and a large amount of them still haven’t grasped that the n-word is more than “just a word” and maybe you shouldn’t be dropping it casually “as a joke”.",

A lot of particular types of games have insanely high LGBTQ people %, the speedrun community has a lot of top players being trans etc.\n\nIt's just that gaming is a massive sphere so there's also the flipside to that, there are specific games and communities that attract more anti-social people and are thus filled with bigots. It's not absolute, for instance MMOs tend to be worse, trade chat in WoW fe is very often filled with slurs and alt right propaganda while FFXIV is one of the most LGBTQ friendly communities you'll ever see and it's filled with furries and gay & trans people.\n\nSo it's wrong to say that gaming period is a bunch of people worried about wokeness just because Call of Duty lobbies are a cesspool.",

It always felt uncomfortable, but even more now.\n\nNot that there's all that much of interest happening anymore anyway, at least not compared to say 2010, which is when I first started watching LTT. I can't believe I lasted this long but earlier this year I too got fed up with where things are going for LMG.",

Communities with mostly neurotypical people will think the same, but they have a filter to not say stuff that is not socially acceptable.\n\nJust wind the clock back a hundred years to see how these people act if it is socially acceptable. What people think doesn't really change. There's always some who think this and other that think that. The only thing that changes are social norms that keep people disagreeing with whatever is in fashion right now silent.",
