Billet Labs may have been excited to get an opportunity and figured LTT wouldn't fuck them over so they went without a NDA. Or they may have feared LTT wouldn't work with them if they requested a NDA, or maybe they couldn't afford an attorney to work out an appropriate NDA. Lots of reasons why they may have went without a NDA. They should have got one, but I could understand that they may not have.\n\nLTT may have been coercive in this whole thing which is what we'll probably never know the truth about.",

One judge even went so far to tell me that if if I think I will get \"justice\" in a court room that I'm an \"IDIOT\"!

Unfortunately for my father, mother's lawyer found a badly formulated paragraph about the splitting of the properties in that settlement. Originally my father was the only owner of the house and the 340 m² garden which he inherited from his father. Mom's lawyer sued him and he had to sell the house and the property and split the money 50/50 with my mom. The lawyer just got paid for the hours and an additional 2000€ because he won the case and my mom wanted to do so. Mother got 600k € for that and father had to pay for the court and mom's lawyer too...\n\nMaybe you never had any experience with lawyers or it's just the difference of lawyers and courts between the EU and the USA ...\n\nIn short, YES, suing some one CAN make you rich",
