Given the situation, it will be unlikely to have audio/video evidence of everything claimed.  Witness testimony is unlikely bc she was told to do a 1 on 1 with the persons involved.  The next best thing is a corroborating testimony at or around the time it occurred which you just confirmed.  If lmg is really going to do an investigation, they should interview you. I hope you avail yourself to whatever outside firm they get to investigate.",

I've never really seen very many issues with LMG or Linus to even suspect anything along those lines. The employees seem to be treated respectfully, Linus has been very vocal and transparent about his business operations, and also remember that Brandon has been with them for a really long time. I don't see why Linus can't comment positively on Brandon's new career? Sure it _could_ all be a PR facade and the intern is writing personal looking comments and whatnot but there's no basis for being pessimistic about it.\n\nMaybe we should just take this relatively inconsequential thing at face value, not overanalyze it and move on in our lives with one fewer negative thought to eat at us.",

We've become so jaded and cynical as a society that we've decided that anyone who's successful must have done it in an illegitimate way somehow.\n\nThe truth is running a business is hard and everyone is going to make mistakes. Also, growing a business is not something that everyone knows how to do right off the bat. Lmg has grown incredibly quickly in the last 3 or 4 years. It's not surprising that there would be some growing pains and the occasional bad decision.\n\nSo you make mistakes, then you try to address those mistakes and do the right thing. I don't doubt that there are things that Linus Media Group could do better. But as far as I have been able to determine both from watching videos and reading things in various places for almost a decade, Linus Sebastian is an extremely driven person but also one who tries to do the right thing most of the time.\n\nCynical comments like OP's, assuming that Linus is an ogre who makes employees pretend to be him in comments, ultimately come out of sheer jealousy. There's no basis to assume that was the case . But Linus is successful so he must be bad right?\n\nIt's just more in a long line of people trying to pull down and delegitimize a successful person because of how \"unfair\" it is the guy has had success at the level LS has had.",

It's sort of an instinctive move at this point to be cynical, not because of any triggering circumstances, but just because we want to see conflict. I'm sure everyone is guilty of this to an extent...\n\nSometimes it is very hard to accept that things on the internet can be normal and mundane and honest. We've seen so much internet drama that it is the default assumption whenever anything at all happens. The best example of this is reddit threads:\n\n> A: Fairly opinionated comment\n>> B: Additional points in agreement\n>>> A: Wtf dude I'm making the same point how am I wrong\n>>>> B: ???? But I was agreeing with you??\n\nSo many threads have this pattern where people agree to a comment but it is assumed that the replies are in an argument against the comment rather than with. That's just our de facto understanding of an internet conversation now.\n\nEdit: [glorious reddit has blessed us with a real example lol](https://www.reddit.com/r/shittymoviedetails/comments/11tcf8p/les_misérables_2012_reuses_a_set_from_harry/jcjfcef/)\n\nAs an aside, didn't Linus have a bit of a controversial past? Maybe I'm hallucinating it but I seem to vaguely remember that back in the older days of LTT people often regarded Linus as being an asshole, and then over time he had a redemption arc or something and now he's a pretty responsible and decent guy. Idk but if I am remembering correctly then probably a lot of hate comments are still drawing from his past behaviour to judge him and his business, which is, I guess quite unfair. People do change after all.",

We love to tear down successful people, not the least because of sour grapes. \"Guy is wildly successful. Bah. He's probably an asshole who abused his employees to get there.\" Then we look for \"evidence\" to fit the story.\n\nMaybe LS was an asshole. You dont get to where he is at without being tenacious. Still, as you said, people grow up. He started on youtube in his early 20s. A lot of early 20 somethings are idiots. Heaven knows I can think of times in my early 20s where I was a complete and total jerk...and now, 20 years older I'm well aware of it and am not that person any more.",
