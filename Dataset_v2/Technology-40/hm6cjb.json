EARN IT was originally given something like a 3% chance of passing. Now that the committee has voted to move to a full vote with an even worse \"fixed\" version of the bill, I'd expect opposition to ramp up considerably. Even very large companies cannot hope to contend with regulations from 50 different states, especially given that it won't help stop child exploitation anyway.\n\nThere are many ways for it to die: it doesn't get brought up for a vote, it gets brought up for a vote but gets referred to committee again to die quietly, it goes up for a vote and is amended into oblivion, it gets passed and the president vetoes it, it becomes law but is such a terrible mistake it gets repealed (with each side blaming the other for it not working), or it dies in the courts.\n\nBut it will die, because it would make the legal and financial costs of doing business too high",

It's magnificent, really, for generations you've been fucked over by bankers and financial speculators.

It's those reprehensible, upper middle class white people who are making the lives of blacks and hispanics bad, and for the upper middle class white people, blacks and hispanics are the root of their problems obviously. Trump will get voted out of office, a great triumph will be proclaimed - a victory of the good, finally, the progressive, liberal Democrats will be once again in office! And the pointless bickering will not change.\n\nI come here, and everyone is blindly focused on the very few discussion points that the mainstream media allows - but it's alright if all media lies and misdirects, it's their platform! For having the country controlled by the media is better than having the media be controlled by the country, you proud Americans would never allow yourselves to be misled in your bastion of freedom and democracy.",

I think we have different views on what “middle” class is. Because it’s shrunken dramatically. Most people have been squeezed up or down as the middle disappears, and both sides blame “the middle”. The same goes with politics. The Bipartisan or Libertarians get all the blame for being “useless” because they won’t fully commit to one side for their lifetime. People have this weird fetish about picking sides politically and if you change you’re a traitor, or if you don’t pick then you’re not useful.",

The way the FCC works, there are actually seats for both Republicans and Democrats and when a vacancy comes up the President can only appoint someone that matches with the party.  Pai was unanimously confirmed in the Senate.\n\nTrump just promoted him to chairman in 2017.",

It’s important to note that AI systems, like the ones used by Reddit and others, are often trained on large amounts of data from the internet, some of which may be copyrighted.\n\nThere have been discussions and lawsuits claiming that this practice violates copyright laws. The argument is that by scraping the web for images or text, AI systems might be using copyrighted work without crediting or rewarding the original creators. This is particularly contentious when the AI systems are capable of generating new content, potentially competing in the same market as the original works.\n\nHowever, it’s also argued that AI systems do not directly store the copyrighted material, but rather learn patterns from it. If an AI system were found to be reproducing copyrighted material exactly, that could potentially be a clear case of copyright infringement.\n\nAs of now, copyright law does not specifically address the issue of AI and machine learning, as these technologies did not exist when the laws were written. The U.S. Copyright Office has issued a policy statement clarifying their approach to the registration of works containing material generated by AI technology. According to this policy, AI-generated content does not meet the criterion of human authorship and is therefore ineligible for copyright protection.\n\nThis is a rapidly evolving field, and the intersection of AI and copyright law will likely continue to be a topic of legal debate and legislative development. It’s important to stay informed about the latest developments in this area. Please consult with a legal professional for advice specific to your situation.\n\n\nBut for the A.I. makers, it’s time to pay up.\n\n“Crawling Reddit, generating value and not returning any of that value to our users is something we have a problem with,” Mr. Huffman said. “It’s a good time for us to tighten things up.”\n\n“We think that’s fair,” he added.",
