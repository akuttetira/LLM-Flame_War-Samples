Which obviously is completely stupid…If we apply the same logic to his products, be it the screwdriver or the backpack are bad because of their price alone.\n\n$70 screwdriver? Bad product, my motherboard/case came with a free one.     $250 backpack? Bad product, I can get a backpack from Walmart for $10.",

You aren't going to get a similar functioning screw driver for $7-$14 (quality ratchet, bit storage, strong magnetic retention)\n\nYou can however find waterblocks for $100-$200 for a 3090ti that will perform basically the same as the billet labs one.\n\nBut again it's a shitty argument because it implies low value products deserve this treatment. The billet labs block never meant to be good value. Its the Bentley of the water blocks. Expensive and over kill for people they want that.",

Even if you were a baller and happy to spend insane money you would invest in a 4090 to get more power than you would get with a 20 degree drop in temperature on a 3090ti.  It really is a product that doesn't have any point to it for quite a few reasons",

The water block is specifically for a specific market that enjoys buying overpriced none essential or functionally necessary things. And for that it works. Its like saying never buy a 2 million dollar lambo because a 200k sports car performs just as well if not better in some situations. some people just buy it for the bling and LTT should have recognized that, and have recognized that for many other intentionally overpriced products previously.",

A friend ik likes to do stuff like this and is very interested in it after seeing the LTT drama. People like different things. Things obviously sold for bling factor shouldnt be judged on its price point because its price is its selling point. The most important information linus could have given for potential buyers are whether or not this performs well at all, rather than being worth the price because its in a specific market. People who are down to shell this kind of money for something interesting also want it to perform very well in addition to the bling, because buying something that looks good but performs like shit just isnt worth it for them.",

I sincerely doubt it and I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone.\n\nDid he do it dirty by not testing it on the correct card with a massively overspecced radiator so it doesn't throw off the results by just taking a long time to reach thermal equilibrium because of the big chunk of copper and therefore not showing off it's true performance? Most definitely, was the video a pile of crap because of the low standards, also most definitely.\n\nbut is he wrong that you would have to be more than a little bit insane to pay 800 for just the waterblock and then on top all the stuff around it to cool a last gen piece of hardware, I really can't say he is.",

I work in heavy industry as a process control technician and the LTT is my daily carry. It's been far more durable than any of the other ones I've had (yes I've dropped it on concrete multiple times, and fully in a tank of water - it's still going strong). I was doubtful on whether it could hold up to industrial use but  I've had it since release and it's exceeded my expectations. I would buy it again.",
