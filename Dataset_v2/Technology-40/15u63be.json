Investors and company leaders don't want niche market money. To them, that's nothing. Why wait years for a few million when you could have gotten that sooner by investing in something else? When they invest in a game that takes 4 years to pay off they want a big pay day.\n\nCapcom will forever chase the success of RE4 because that's THE resident evil hit, and it's and action game.\n\nIt was so successful that Dead Space, Gears, The Last of Us and many other have been chasing that success as well",

Iirc, floatplane operated at a loss until fairly recently.\n\n>Another reason for such a big team is because he went for scale of videos rather than quality. It was the low hanging fruit and a conscious decision.\n\nYea not arguing against that, just saying that with wanting to scale that fast comes increased costs. They spent like a million+ on labs and a team for it.\n\n>He has an extensive line of products which dwarfs mkbhd and he has a 3 or sometimes 4 hour podcast which at this point of time is just a vehicle to move his merch rather than anything else.\n\nI don't watch much of the podcast tbh but I think that's related. There's more of a pinch when you're in such a fickle industry & fortunes can change so quickly (as this debacle has shown)\n\nHe might not have to be that aggresive in selling merch but we're both just speculating without knowing their costs/etc. Could be they just have a few months of runway, could have years.\n\n>Mkbhd makes videos because he loves making videos. Same with people like Mark Rober and others. Linus makes videos because he loves making money.\n\nCan't say I really disagree here. Speculating again but maybe his attitude change is cuz like you said, he just doesn't care for the content anymore. It's clear he was super passionate about it in the early to mid days of the channel.",

The fact that they make back their salary in some way doesn't mean they're not a cost.\n\n>Companies make money from the work their employees do, so more employees means more money. Unless you are stupid and hire badly.\n\nFor sure, but not every employee at a company directly generates revenue. Even disregarding that, all employees fall under costs.",

There's a reason even the largest tech companies like google, meta and twitter have had massive layoffs. The workers don't print money just by sitting at a desk in their office",

Open a 3rd party investigation into workplace harassment and discrimination and immediately terminate anyone involved in said harassment and discrimination that being either doing it, willingly allowing it to continue or attempting to hide it.\n\n6. find the victims of said harassment and discrimination and compensate them ALOT.\n\n7. (getting into fixing the LMG image) release the finding of the investigation mention above with sensitive information redacted announce how the company has delt with the people involved.\n\n8. Once thats all cleaned up THE AND ONLY THEN should they start working on videos again (they should have the money to keep paying people during this down time and if not they shouldn't be in business anyway imo)\n\n9. Give full access to any piers who want to come and check you have cleaned house and allow them to make sure the company has actually fixed everything.\n\n10. Go back to focusing on videos and products.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe company would take a huge hit in the short term (again if they dont have the money for a rainey day why the fuck are they valued at over 100 mill or whatever) but in the long term not only would you save if nor build a stronger appearance but having cleaned house of the rot should allow you to build back better. And if its found out that the issues are coming from the previous head well tough shit their out of here.",

They spend so much time making perfect scripts with the perfect amount of jokes and perfect amount of snarkiness that flow throughout their whole video, that it builds a false sense of: “we always work so hard not to be out of touch, so how can we ever be so wrong or out of touch about something.”\n\nThey think everyone is rooting for them in their mind, all eyes on them, telling themselves they have room to be “personable” because things ARE serious but *aren’t that serious* so they’ll absolutely address problems they have, but they think they can’t or don’t ever do major harm to people, because they work so hard at being “right.” So it’ll be solved if they just make a video about it. Out of touch.\n\nThat’s my two cents since I have a personal relationship with a former best friend of 14 years who I cut out of my life. He was a top LTT fan and I realized he took a lot of personality traits from Linus into his own daily life. Always explaining details and saying “this is the right way” and “why would you ever spend money on this when it’s just bad.” Saw the same toxicity and left him.",
