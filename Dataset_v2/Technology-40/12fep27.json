    "post_text ": "Greetings, all. Seemed like as good time as any to write this.\n\nThis is the not-so-timestamp guy. Today marks the 200 hours total of WAN Show runtime timestamped by yours truly, how fun is that? Odd how I reached that before the 100 stamps goal, but I digress.\n\nThese times have been fun, watching as the WAN Show crew developed with its own selection of two amazing producers & equally engaging writers discussion notes. Not sure how I ended up as a consistent stamper, and I've grown to enjoy it. LMG also sent two care packages as well! Never anticipated the merch would be great, and yet I am daily driving them.\n\nRegrettably, with the runtime of the show blowing out of the waters and right into the atmosphere, it has become more difficult and unhealthy for me to continue stamping them live throughout midnight to morning, and the inability to drink water or coffee (Ramadan) during the sessions is not helping. I can't afford it physically, financially and mentally.\n\nIt has been an honor to have the chance to [make an archive document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R8f1IILzJV-xH6LP7Npj5PNgrI8DquxicFjZOxJvQgI/edit?usp=sharing) of timestamps for you all. [I'll leave you with a little metric of the total characters & size of the stamps.](https://i.imgur.com/AgaSg4q.png)\n\nSpecial thanks to Bell, Luke, Riley, Dan, Adam P, Steven C, Sven, James, Linus, Luke \\[Probation Writer Employee\\] and you, the one reading this.\n\nUntil next time,\n\nNoKi1119.",
