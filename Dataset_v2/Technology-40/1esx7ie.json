                    "Reply_Text": "As someone who has had one for about 4 years now, yes it is durable besides the fact the one front corner is a little ruined because i do the thing that they specifically mention not to do and thats sit cross legged in the chair. Besides that minor cracking of the arm rest underside that easily repairable with a drop of super glue.\n\nThe chair completely solved my back and sciatic issues and is still comfortable enough that i fall asleep in it regularly. I also sit in it without a shirt on which they mention can ruin the material on the back but mine is still in mint condition.\n\nThe chairs have also gotten better with more features over the last 4 years and i kind of want a newer one but this chair is just still in too good of condition to warrant getting a new chair. At this rate i expect to maybe be buying a new secret lab chair in another 4 years from now\n\n\nPS Don't think its fair that you are beginning to be down voted for what seems to be an honest question from someone who doesn't know",
