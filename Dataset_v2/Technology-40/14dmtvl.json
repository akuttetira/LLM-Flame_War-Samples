I DO care about IP rating and would prefer to buy a phone that’s built with that feature in mind.\n\nThe point of the free market is to allow companies to cater to different types of customer, and for customers to vote with their wallets.\n\nThis may be “pro-consumer” in theory, but it’s short-sighted and will hurt consumers in reality.",

It vould just mean dont glue the fucking batter down under everything and make it so people can remove it. Also it should not be hard to keep the ip rating if the seal is just normal.\n\nAlso this isnt about consumers and wanting something different the ip rating is just something that should be easy to get they had them 20 years ago aswell. Its more about be able to remove the battery and recycle the rest of the phone easily and not have to basicly destroy the whole damn thing because companys glue the damn thing down.",

So, if we have e.g. 2mm all around for an opening + a seal, you'd seriously lose out on battery capacity. That would give less than half the thickness of the phone for the battery.\n\nI'd say not being waterproof will kill my phone much quicker than the battery aging, and even if I cant replace the battery myself, I can take it to a shop that will do it.

And I can guarantee that the EU will not want people poking around the internals of their phone with a tool. There will be a plethora of health and safety regs about how the user replaces the battery. And protections from the user accidentally damaging the phone while replacing the battery. Or damaging the battery itself.\n\nTo put it simply, the EU will want to make the process foolproof. Disbelieve me. Downvote me.

The EU never introduce one rule or regulation when fifty will do.\n\nThe first poster was being naive. In fact, they were being really fucking naive.",

The battery has died/degraded on almost every device I’ve owned, likewise for others. Paying $50-$100 for a $5 battery replacement is a total ripoff. Glad this framework is addressing that.",
