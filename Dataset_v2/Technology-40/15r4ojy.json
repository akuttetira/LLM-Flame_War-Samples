The analogy I have been using is that it's like testing a mouse by seeing if it makes a good monitor, then when it doesn't make a good monitor telling people, \"Yeah we didn't test this as a mouse, just a monitor, but it sucks as a monitor so you shouldn't buy it at all even to use it as a mouse.\" It's just fucking non-sense and it shows laziness and a lack of integrity from Linus in particular.",

At max it costs 4.000 dollars for 2.8 million views or 6.000-30.000 dollars. That is a GREAT investment.\n\n> Though refused to spend a few hundred, some of which is paid to workers for their job, to verify their data with using the proper configuration (meaning using the proper board, the proper graphics card, etc [Things they used to test it before shooting the initial video]).\n\nThis amount of spending would be a waste for a video that simply won't get to those numbers. But they should have done it anyway, or scrapped the entire video. It's never worth creating a BAD video. It hurts the brand.\n\n> Given it's weight, issues, etc. Yes, I'd call it (the controller) a waste of over $80,000.\n\nYou can, you would just be wrong though. It's an investment in gold, as they now have over 1.5 KG of it.

The thing, the first in a long line of ”things” we do have value! Not just sentimental value, which is strong !!, but in experience, in learning and knowledge. Something we sometimes takes for granted. Until we do something unique, something that leap-frog our experience, our understanding of the world around us.\n\nSo for me, that’s ugly, but I can see the sheer beauty it must hold to you and I salute you!",

I'd go read his post on the forum for it. The point is, if a product isn't given a fair chance to be demonstrated on one of the biggest if not the biggest PC hardware based tech channel, people might come off of the video thinking the company itself doesn't make good products even if Linus chose the wrong GPU for it. That's just something you've gotta deal with as a channel this big and Linus acknowledged that he made a mistake looking at it from a buyer's perspective instead of listening to his employees (who are also a part of the community).",

Point is, it's a huge hassle to deal with and Linus, of all people, should know considering the shit he's had to deal with when it comes to things like unreasonable sponsors.\n\nEdit: watching GN's new video in real time and they sent the email for reimbursement about 2-3 hours after his previous video 🤦‍♂️. Idk, maybe Linus (or Terren) need to scale everything down a bit? Idk. Doesn't seem like the company is doing too well with doing things to the quality they make it seem for us with stuff like the merch. Now I'm wondering how deep this goes. Does the zipper have something related to this? Probably not but I honestly would suggest LMG to take a few days off and just restructure or redo their internal systems.

The humility in accepting that countless hours and tens of thousands of dollars of research and development are gone, to then go on to send a message to whomever may have it now that they wish them well with it is inspiring. Innovation is a nearly insurmountable mountain in getting a product to market and getting a company with the audience of LTT to review a design prototype must have felt like a huge milestone, only to receive a half-hearted attempt at a review and insulting coverage of the product; losing the product altogether afterwards isn't just insult to injury it really should be criminal, even if only negligently so.",

I wish you all the best and you definetly deserved a fair review and way better treatment than you got... but I guess \"bad publicity is better than no publicity\" and you are most likely getting way more views now than ever... Lets hope it bring on something good.\n\nI watched through the \"review video\" of your cooler and it was an interesting product that should have recieved proper respect and care which was completely lacking in that video. I hope you will let someone else test that product for a proper review. It's a fun unique product that could for sure be interesting to the most \"extreme\" of builders... But as others said it is a halo product for the few... but it could get the \"less extreme\" to look at your other products just like many drewl over the 4090 but buy 4060 level cards",

The evidence (albeit circumstantial) actually leans towards something sinister.\n\n1) GN's noted the conflicts of interest with Noctua and Asus.  Who's to say Noctua didn't like the competition?\n\n2) LTT having review TONS of products and even making some of their own should know that custom milling is expensive ESPECIALLY for a startup and would outweigh the cost of shipping by a large margin.\n\n3) Most companies would simply ask if they would like to be included in auctions ESPECIALLY with prototype IP.  Why didn't they ask Billet?  Even tossing it avoids a bunch of legal issues, avoiding unintentionally selling other people's property.\n\n4) One minute of Googling shows me their Reddit post which they mention tells me that their end goal (and a few commenters note even before they mention it) is making smaller form factor cases.    Why didn't LMG - which should be far more experienced than some random commenters - know this?  Did Billet not tell them?\n\n\nThere's a lot of questions that yes, you could say it was several innocent mistakes... But that's a LOT of mistakes in one review.\n\nThe funniest part is that regardless of the reason (malice or stupidity), it makes LMG either look stupid or be untrusted due to conflicts of interest.",

The truth of how/why this breach of ethics occurred?  I'll never know.  LMG/LTT isn't about fair, competent, unbiased unboxings & reviews.  Are there any such reviewers left anymore?  Fair conduct, objectivity, honesty, suffer in the name of financial profit.\n\nLinus has grown his brand into among, if not the most, influential social media group of it kind. This, despite the frequent unprofessionalism, clumsiness & technical incompetence commonly displayed in typical content.  Even the more serious nature of the negative media attention brought after the cooling block incident hasn't proven to be much of an obstacle for the group.  Over two months later now, & LTT seems as strong as ever.",
