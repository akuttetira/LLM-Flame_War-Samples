If Youtube went just by the title then almost none of the LTT audience would actually see it. If the algorithm cared about the title then the title of that video would be descriptive.",

Not only is it going back on their word, which people are already extremely skeptical of them doing further, but putting Linus Luke and Dan live in front of everyone is an absolutely awful idea - who knows what any of the trio might say with good intentions and get completely mistaken, it has happened for much smaller things, and is the problem with live video. And quite frankly, as well-natured as much of the LTT community is trying to be, they don't deserve some of the hate that'll be coming their way live. As stupid as the original response was, Linus is right, they are still humans and we should treat them as such (not treat LMG as of course, but treat the individuals there as). But some people will forget that and a WAN could be extremely difficult for the trio.\n\nI'm gonna miss WAN this week, I don't think there's actually a WAN show I haven't watched, and I can't remember the last time a Friday was skipped (if ever?). I also want answers as much as the next person. But doing WAN this week would be an absolutely *awful* idea. And keeping Linus off camera is even more ridiculous, that'll appear like hiding, and for better or for worse, Linus is the one who is calling the shots and giving the answers, someone else will have no advantage being there. Maybe a text post update would be a good replacement?",
