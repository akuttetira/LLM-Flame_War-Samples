It's been a fun run, r/place, small communities, the memes, the discussions. But without the third party apps the site is significantly worse off. And even more concerning is the clear direction the site/company is heading towards.\n\nThey never intended to negotiate, they intended to eliminate the 3rd party apps all along. And they mean to do that so that they can consolidate their harvesting of user data.  Same as any other social media website that has been ruined.\n\nIt's just so sad and depressing seeing everything (and I mean damn near *everything*) get worse instead of better.\n\nEDIT to add: I love social media. Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, reddit...they all are amazing ideas at their core and all have the potential to be fantastic user products. But this profit driven impulse to harvest data, spy, and psychologically manipulate their users ruins everything. Facebook is now a shell of what it once was, and of it's true potential. There are other ways of generating profit or revenue that are not so dystopian, yet we sit back and allow things to continue to get worse. We need better laws and regulations on targeted advertising, on user data harvesting, and on user manipulation.",
