It’s unnecessarily wasteful. Linus complains about tech waste and e-waste and in a domain he controls is doing something responsible that’s a little bit more work.\n\nBut more importantly, had they dropped the hardcore apology video, then got hit with the SA  / hostile workplace public accusations…\n\nThere couldn’t be a second apology video that’s  even more sincere. It’s all pretty shit but having this apology video be on-brand with their shtick actually works in their favor a lot IMO. It will allow them to make a distinction between money and morality.",

Had this Billet Labs thing occurred without the piling on of a disgruntled employee talking about Sexual Assault, self-harm, promises unkept, hostile work environment…\n\nThe apology video might be a little cringey but otherwise completely fine. The humor is just their humor. Getting on their proverbial knees to beg for their audience forgiveness over a dispute with a single vendor is melodramatic and outside of “celebrity drama” or in this case “YouTube drama” no business and vendor would ever have this dispute be handled liked this.\n\nSo to do that would come off as fake and insincere. I think it was also an inflection point.\n\nLinus hired a CEO because he’s over managing everything and too much was already slipping through the cracks. His creators also seem over worked and the quality of videos has slipped. So using this drama as a turning point while also announcing a hiatus was objectively good.\n\nThe big turn is Madison’s post. It makes the apology video into a funhouse mirror. Everything it was trying to do is distorted and gross.\n\nNow they’re a bit stuck. Releasing yet another apology video (back to back) would definitely come off badly. Plus they have to actually find the truth and potentially fire several people.\n\nI wouldn’t speak to my audience on video (that will be picked apart) until everything has basically been resolved.",

From a pinned comment in the video itself telling people that it's fine and to not harass the guy, to a message in the description, to just re-editing or deleting the video altogether.\n\nUnfortunately, everyone watching the video from the time of its release to today sees the exact same video that triggered fans to go on a harassment spree.

I'm sure it was probably hard for her to do, and I think it's good that she did, for multiple reasons. It seems by her tweets that this was something she wanted to get off of her chest for a while and there's nothing wrong with that at all. I hope she gained some closure from it, and can truly move on with her life in the best way she can.\n\nI think the point being made (and the one I agree with) is that it isn't helpful for the community to start turning into an angry mob, speculating on things they have no business speculating on, villainizing the entire company and everyone in it, and suddenly nitpicking every little action they take from here. I've already seen loads of potential misinformation spread on this subreddit by people making speculative claims they have no business making, and then others repeating it as fact in some morbid game of reddit telephone....A game I've seen on the internet far too many times now. It's dangerous to read into every tweet and start making wild assumptions about anybody and everybody. When everyone grabs the pitchforks the wrong people often end up getting targeted and hurt, and it's hard to remember the humans.\n\nAll we can really do is acknowledge what happened, let LMG know that the community holds them to a higher standard (which I think we've accomplished) and....Wait. Wait for them to fix what is broken. If they fail, they fail - but it feels like a lot of people here have turned into a mob that *want* them to fail, and are actively trying to tear things down instead of hoping they build it back up better.",

It's the same shit that led to the Boston bomber fiasco and happens a lot more than you think (99% of the time it happens it's just not news-worthy). There's really no changing it honestly.

As an older but still relatively recent example in the grand scheme of things, in 2008/2009 there was a bunch of drama (outside of reddit) in DotA about pros cheating. Turned out there was none, but the rumor mill was in full effect for a while and people with no business in the matter mistook carefully timed screenshots as proof of cheating. The creator of the mod had to make a public statement clarifying the issue and very kindly telling people to fuck off.\n\nEven before that statement, I thought almost the exact same thoughts you wrote.\n\nThe only solace I take is that this will blow over and be forgotten as other stupid shit comes up and people continue to unnecessarily insert themselves in situations that have nothing to do with them.",

LMG has a new captain of the ship now and from today’s video and the announcement that he is hiring an outside investigator for the Madison situation, he’s taking all of this seriously and doing it with the intent to better LMG.\n\nThe video had a few too many jokes for me (Nick shouldn’t have plugged the LTT Store for example) but it’s clear that they want to do better and are making an earnest effort to do that. They already lost money on subs to Youtube and Floatplane publicly but taking a week off from making videos to fix things is a very good step. It also sounds like they are putting guard rails on Linus so he doesn’t make things unnecessarily worse than he should, love to see this. As for the Billet Labs situation, they fucked up and they own it, Colton explained his mistake and why the situation got worse. They shouldn’t have auctioned the block off but they did realize the mistake and took steps to fix it, I can’t fault them for actively trying to fix it even if the employee didn’t check who the email went to.",

But that's not what you do in crisis management and they have now crossed over into serious crisis management. In fact, LMG needs to bring in a real crisis management consultant in addition to the outside investigator in order to get a handle on things. The jokes during the apology video were a little jarring. Linus still being defensive before actually apologizing wasn't good crisis management and took away a lot of the good points that Terran and the rest of the leadership team made. Linus is still the face of the company and his name is on the door. I'm glad the video began and ended with Terran, but the company culture is all about Linus, whether Linus likes it or not. As any of our parents have said to us countless times, \"There is a time and a place for everything\".",

Colton \"sent\" (mind the quotes in this and previous comment) an email to Billet Labs before (10th of August) the GN video (14th of August). That email silently failed due to user error (omission of recipient address), and Colton provided proof (as much as screenshots are proof) for this. The dilemma is that from BilletLab's perspective LMG never reached out, but from the LMG perspective they did reach out. To be clear, the blame still lies with LMG, but the ill intent, that was a large part of the accusation of malice levied against LMG, turned out to be a \"simple\" misunderstanding.\n\nIronically, if GN had reached out to LMG with Billet Lab's side of the story, then the failed email and subsequently the misunderstanding would have likely resolved sooner and more amicably. Not saying at all that Steve has a responsibility whatsoever to help LMG resolve such matters, but it would have certainly helped to hear out the LMG side, of this two-sided story.",

His impulse was to not be silent on the matter, and he relayed what information he had been given/had, and likely believed it to be true.\n\nHe’s visibly frustrated with the situation, because he hasn’t allowed himself the time to actually listen and and see the other side of the Billet Labs situation. He’s been grinding away for so long that he hasn’t realized he’s no longer at the scale where “we’ll fix this as we go along” can happen on the fly and without real rigor around process changes and how to implement them in various departments.\n\nYour time and again stated goal was to build a “real company”, Linus. Real companies have overhead and capacity constraints. You can’t do everything all at once. You can’t make these fixes yourself. You have to rely on the people you hired.\n\nHopefully this crisis-imposed breath taking will get you to relax and see if the company you built can right the ship with less of your input.",

What they absolutely need to do is find out EVERYTHING that is going on over this next week. Any and all things that happened with Madison or anyone else needs to be found and dealt with otherwise they really will have RT situation where for the next 2 years they will be dealing with issues that come out and continue to erode faith even with their hardcore fans.\n\nPersonally, I've unsubbed from all of their channels and will wait to see how things happen from here on out. I'm not above second chances. I think we all have said stupid shit that we regret. The difference is actually changing and removing yourself from those ideas.",
