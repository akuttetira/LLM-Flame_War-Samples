We will have to wait and see what the response is. This is way different from the billet labs situation and general mistakes.\n\nBillet labs was a massive oversight, and while the general mistakes they have been making in videos is concerning, I thought some of the responses have been a bit more than overblown.\n\nThis situation is different because it's obviously more serious in nature. On one hand, I'm always suspicious of people who wait to make accusation until after another controversy is already happening. We've seen that plenty of times before, sometimes legimate, sometimes not. On the other hand, this has to be taken seriously until we have more information.\n\nMy point being, I don't know Madison, neither in person nor in any parasocial way. I have zero idea how credible the accusations are one way or the other. As of now I am in wait and see mode. That's all we can do right now.",

Like if you can bring it up now, why not back when you quit. If linus is the bad guy we are making him out to be, then he is a scumbag, but i have doubts about the authenticity of this because of the opportune time to spring these allegations being so long ago.",

It’s well documented in academic psychology research.\n\nIt often takes a catalyzing event - like someone else taking a risk and shattering a carefully crafted public image - for someone who has experienced trauma, assault, or abuse of this nature to come forward.  You see this all the time with victims of sexual assault and bullying - and some of Madison’s claims involve that.\n\nGiven how many comments like yours I’ve seen today…All of the above are valid reasons for someone not to comment.\n\nThat being said, I do not know Madison.  I do think her claims need to be taken seriously and investigated.  They should not be dismissed out of hand, however.",

( Being completely oblivious to things he  finds casual/normal while also maintaining a strict micro management culture towards the goals he sets for the company).\n\n\nThe part of LTT taking the cut of the monetization of personal YouTube/twitch channels is something he has mentioned before. So it being mishandled as Madison says is not far fetched.\n\nThe part of inappropriate workplaces stuff. The fact he openly joked about the LTT underwear shoot and how it made everyone involved uncomfortable and him not recognizing how bad it sounds makes me think the Madison is not far off when  saying that her complaints went unnoticed.\n\nHer being over worked and being looked down upon for taking sick days is also not farfetched if you have listened to Linus talking about workplaces management in the past and what he expects from LTT employees.",

It happened to her before, when she quit, it happened to that guy who bought the silver play button (afaik he ended up committing suicide), and who knows how many more people it happened to already? They never put a spotlight on these.\n\nAnd with the raw anger some terminally online people have for sexual harassment allegations, even when they check out (_especially_ when they check out) this would have been wildly unsafe for her. It probably took a lot of bravery for her to come out with these allegations today as well, and she got a golden opportunity.",

Any normal Human being would have contacted a lawyer and sued the shit out of LTT to get money. As for her reasons why not, she stated that she was fearing the community and didnt have the courage to take on a million dollar company? Like what? Sue a million dollar company and get big compensation would be my first thought if i was her. Then add the part where she cut her leg so she can go to the ER instead of work ???!?!?! This shit sounds made up as fuck and if not she should maybe visit a mental hospital. A hospital ER visit should be ez to just post a picture about and there you go evidence.  She has only posted twitter threads with her alligations and not a single piece of evidence and yet people are pulling out their pitchforks already. Have people not learned to be skeptical?",

They fire whoever was involved in the incidents with Madison (Terren should be pulling up any and all HR records on this literally right this moment). And Linus takes a long sebatical effective immediately, after a monumental apology.\n\nLuke & Terren release a statement addressing ALL of the issues raised in the last 48 hours with an immediate POA for how they will be dealt with.\n\nI just don't see any other way.",

I am very much in the camp of \"believe the women/girls\", but before you can take action against someone (firing an employee, settling a legal action) there needs to be more than just belief.  Do I believe that LMG is probably a bit of a sausage fest and can be a hostile work environment for the women who work there not named Yvonne?  Yup.  Can they do something about it?  Yup.  And who knows, maybe there have already been some changes, maybe not.  I'd expect with such a high profile hiring and departure as Madison was that there would have had to be some degree of internal examination of what went wrong that goes deeper than \"she just flaked out\".\n\nGiven Linus' previous response was that \"nothing can legally prevent an employee in Canada from filing a complaint, and since one hasn't been filed so I guess we're in the clear\" then it is pretty clear that he was aware of her claims, at least at the time of her departure.  He probably would have been better served by simply saying \"we don't comment on personnel matters\" and left it at that.  He does tend to get himself into trouble by talking too much.
