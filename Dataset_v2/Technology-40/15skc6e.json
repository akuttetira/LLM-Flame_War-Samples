We have no proof of anything that might or might not have happened. The best practice in a situation like this is to be supportive to the accuser, but not attack anyone. If the claims turn out to be true, then a shit storm will commence either way, but if they are false then the damage from pre-emptive reactions could career ending anyway.\n\nSee the Kwite allegations from less than 6 months ago, man was accused of a lot of stuff, but it turns out that Kwite was actually the victim and had years worth of chat logs to prove it. It still ruined his online career and mental health and he isn't even sure if he want's to do online content anymore and after 6 months he hasn't really uploaded anything but joke tweets. Accusations alone can be damaging, but that doesn't mean we should attack the accuser either. WAIT FOR PROOF!",
