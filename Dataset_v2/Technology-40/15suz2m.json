So I tried to argue.\n\nI noticed lots of racism from people that were obvious fans of him, and I don’t mean some racist takes or something, I mean racial slurs and comparing black people to monkeys. It was everywhere.\n\nBut I didn’t blame Louis as he is not responsible for his comments. I sent him a reply that just said something along the lines of “If outright racist people are subscribed to your channel, active fans and say racist stuff in your comments maybe you should consider that your take on this subject may be biased. And is that a community you want to foster.” Now keep In mind I phrased it very positively and NEVER called him a bad person or a racist, just that he was fostering a racist community. I am not saying it’s exactly his fault or his want to foster a racism community, but that’s what he was doing.\n\nHe replied to me saying that he’s not racist and he’s not responsible for his comments, both things I didn’t say. He also said i was a “weasel” and something along the lines of “a lying weasel that never likes the truth.” He failed to engage in a single one of my arguments in good-faith.\n\nTo add on to this, he responded to multiple peoples replies just calling them a re**rd. ( r slur )\n\nI find it incredibly hypocritical to call it An “ honest discussion” when he was not open to discussing. I didn’t even outright disagree with his opinion, I was literally just asking him to rethink his position while remaining civil and clean.\n\nEdit: whether you completely agree or disagree, reporting me to the Reddit suicide thing is pretty immature, we can agree on that can’t we?",

Implying that Rossmann is responsible for some of the people that watch his videos saying racist shit when Rossmann himself has never said anything even close to racist is just nonsense. I can pretty much guarantee at least one racist had read your comment and thought \"yeah, that stupid Jew Rossmann is definitely a piece of shit.\" Are *YOU* racist? Kind of seems like you hate Jewish people otherwise you wouldn't be supporting things that anti-Semites agree with. See how absurd that is?",

At all. Because Louis isn't racist and doesn't do or say anything with the intent of attracting racist people. Like what do you expect him to do? Preface all his videos with a statement like \"racists aren't welcome here, please leave. OK guys, now that the racists are gone we can continue the video.\" Like it's just asinine that you think he's doing anything wrong. And it's low key sociopathic that you attempted to bully him into doing something about something that isn't within his control. But really, you just want to force him to say your words because that's what all you hyperwoke people do. It isn't good enough just to not be racist, people have to repeat your goddamned mantras on demand.\n\nAs I said. There's an anti-Semite somewhere who likes that you're taking pot shots at Rossmann. What are you going to do about that person reading your comment? Until you have an answer, you should leave Rossmann alone.",

To cherry pick an opinion he has (even if he was wrong and I don't think he was, neither do 10s of millions of others.)\n\nHolding a certain opinion on public events that disagrees with unhinged leftist cultism doesn't make someone bad. I don't agree with everything he does or says but life is complicated. People are complicated, his job is stressful. You try working with legislatures, Ive spent 100s of hours a year the last few years fighting and lobbying and it makes me cranky too.\n\nLook Democrats, Republicans, people smart enough to not follow a party, we can all get behind Louis until someone gives us a real reason that isn't \" omg he disagreed with me!\" His actions, his sacrifices earn him that.",
