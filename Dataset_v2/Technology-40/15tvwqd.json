It's why all these \"centrists\" support the worst things.\n\nIt's basically telling the victim \"I'm going to believe only half the things you say, or half of the severity, to appear impartial\" which is the same as calling them a liar.\n\nThe \"both sides\" crowd is always supporting one side.",

Nothing of much substance has surfaced since the initial allegations and only time will be able to tell who did/knew what. As far as everything that has been said, there appears to be problems, how bad is currently unclear. The company obviously did take steps to address them and their handling of the Madison situation to the outside world is about as good as can be expected, they did nothing to attack or discredit her and never commented on the situation until they had to. The meeting was not a bad thing despite what people are saying. They were addressing an issue that was brought to their attention whether as rumors or not. That joke was really out of place though and I was kinda taken aback by their leisurely demeanor after.",

I often times find myself coming to Linus defense simply because some people blow things so far out of proportion it's ridiculous.

People sure love to grab their pitchforks at a moments notice and any critical thinking just goes out the window.\n\nMy real guess here is that Linus knew there was some bad stuff, but just not how bad it really was until recently so that's the surprise. In a business that big it is easy for him to truly not be up on every little thing that goes on down to it's exact details, especially if it's one of the other managers that cause the issues in the first place, then would sugar coat it to Linus. Buuut. even though this is my guess, it's still just speculation and is honestly what I hope we end up learning because I like Linus and would honestly like to continue liking him. But he did fuck up in how he handle the response to this, and I hope that all gets sorted and whomever is the bad actor here gets ousted. And if it is Linus, then well I guess I will unsub, but that could be the end of the channel effectively.",

Different people work differently and have different priorities. Some live for their job, some prioritise their time off more, and that is okay. As long the work that you were hired for is done it shouldn't matter. I think Linus expected everyone to adopt his work style no matter what. I mean the company is his baby and he has a vision which is understandable.\nThat leaked recording of the meeting he sounded like he knew what was going on and that he was not happy with it. That's probably why he hired a third party to help with it.\nDon't get me wrong, some of his decisions are still very questionable and show some narcissistic behaviour, but this subreddit also needs to paddle back a bit.",

Some of us who knew where to look knew somewhat of what Madison claimed, and some ppl made YT videos bout it 5 months ago, what happened? The die hard fans downvoted the video and left nasty comments. All of the BS over the years has cumulated into this massive backlash, and yes, it's had the effect ppl want. But as of rn, a part of me is feels like they are \"addressing\" things, bc of the backlash, and not bc they believe in it. Linus' response and the wooden robotic actions in the video, plus Linus' tweets afterwards just shows that. I'm guessing he's had his accounts locked from him to prevent him from doing more damage. I'm not wanting the channel to burn to the ground, but maybe a badly scorched wildfire is needed here, to let that first new growth of green shoots rise outa the damage and decay, and become stronger for it.

So finding nothing can either mean it was swept under the rug, or that thwre was nothing to find and we will never know which it is.\n\nAnd even if the report came back saying that nobody is doing their due dilligence when a report of sexual harassement is made, do you really think we'll get that full, unedited report? Hiring a third party to investigate doesn't mean much if they can just throw the report in the trash.\n\nIn the end, we'll have their words that the investigation will be taken into consideration, nothing more, and we'll be in the same boat where fans will say the investigation cleared them of everything while the others will just say the investigation means nothing since we don't even know who the third party is and what the report said exactly.",

Whatever they choose to say publicly to save face with the community, that’s up to them, but that’s not the priority here.\n\nAdditionally, if you’re as cynical about the investigation as you are here, what would you have them do?

Like you said, I'm not owed anything, so I'll see how everything goes. While I like the channel and even bought a bit of merch, if the channel doesn't change for the better I'll just stop tuning in. And if I see them take enough actionable items and follow through with them, I'll just continue watching.\n\nMy point was just that we will never know if the investigation is thorough or correct, and it might even be impossible to have a full investigation of the Madison case when there is no paper trail for anything.",

We can watch things happen and our brains can gloss over some pretty terrible stuff. We tend to gravitate towards a non-chaotic environment and even the most well meaning of us will hand wave terrible events if that keeps the equilibrium or status quo.\n\nThe situation with Emily is cognitively different. She has a lot more well earned respect (that shouldn’t matter but we are people after all) and that alone may be enough bias to shift attitudes. I doubt it but it could be. Odds are the situation with Emily has been a long time coming and people respond to gradual changes better than sudden ones, such as the need to put yourself out there to deal with sexual harassment of a coworker.\n\nThings with Emily sound like they are going well. That is a huge win we should be happy for and give credit for. However, the situation with Madison is a different beast. It’s a common situation that is commonly mishandled. I work for a Fortune 500 company and we handle things almost identically to what Madison described and have an eerily similar protocol to the one outlined in the video.\n\nNone of that is an excuse for it. It’s not just LMG that needs to handle these issues better, but they’re not uncommon even amongst larger and more experienced teams of leadership.",
