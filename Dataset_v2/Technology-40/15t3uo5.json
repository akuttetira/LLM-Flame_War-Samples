An app download can take longer, and even if that bothered a particular end-user, where else are they going to get apps on their iPhone? Videos buffering frequently or the quality being reduced to 2006 Youtube are an issue that a start-up video host can't continue to have and continue to be successful, or competitive.\n\n\nAdditionally, Apple operates at a huge scale. They are long since past the need to charge the percentage they charge to make even a tidy profit, let alone have that unit of the business be solvent. Floatplane would need to grow a lot before a thinner margin is still good profit.\n\nP.S. No interest in riding Linus' dick, but Floatplane vs. AppStore is an astoundingly shallow equivalence.",

When you make less you need to have less overhead and staff. Maybe they only can support 80 people at their new incomed and they have to layoff 20.\n\nI don't know what the actual result will be, but people celebrating $25k/month less for floatplane don't see that as maybe 2-3 people's income that LTT might have to stop paying as do layoffs.",

I liked many of their random hacky engineering videos, content mac address does and felt like Luke with floatplane is building a really good tool for creators to have a platform outside of the tech giants. I liked that they pointed out some serious flaws with Linux gaming (although I don't agree with him on everything, extensions don't really mean anything its the file encoding that matters) and that they believed in and invested in framework at an early stage. Linus himself was always kinda iffy fbh.\n\nI bought some of their merch (wanted a mouse pad and theirs had good reviews. I also decided to buy a few extra things alongside it) and found their quality to be actually really good and comfortable. that's when I subbed to floatplane too. But I can't support a company that takes serious allocations lightly. I unsubbed after Linus' response on forums. I briefly considered resubbing after their video response but then I learnt of Madison's thread and now I'll hold off until we have proper answers.\n\nI still think there are a lot of talented people working there to build great products and content. I've liked all of the clothing gear I've bought from them and floatplane has been very responsive when I find a bug and report it to them. it looks like Luke also embraces remote work with all their floatplane and many engineering positions having a \"or remote\" option as well. they are actually investing in quality clothing and not just screen printing their logo on a blank like they used to in early days.\n\nI have a friend who has their screwdriver and having used some other brands that are usually quite respected, it's actually made quite well.\n\nso it saddens me to see one guy's arrogance (even if that guy is the literal owner) ruin it for everyone. That said, we can't discount Madison's thread and we need more answers, real changes, and more transparency moving forward. we also need to know if they'll stick to it or just revert back to their old ways after larger community pressure goes down.\n\nIf it's true that they only responded to Billet after the expose, that's a bad look. but if what they say that they had already approved anything necessary to make it right. that means they still have a do right culture but they need some serious work on communication and transparency within the organization. and that's a big IF.\n\nOn one hand, their response gives me hope, but some of the leaks and what other former employees have said also makes me think their response can end up being a questionable gesture. so I'll hold off on that sub, and buying their merch. will keep an eye on their response and their attempts to improve and then decide what I wanna do moving forward",
