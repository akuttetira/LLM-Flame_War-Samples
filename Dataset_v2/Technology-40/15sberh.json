Even if he did lie, Steve could have ripped him a new asshole for it.\n\n>They massively fucked up the review so whatever context there might be doesnt matter in the slightest.\n\nIf course context matters and while I personally don't think the review is in any way bad and just doesn't fill the wants of what many seem to want from a review (I didn't care about the thermals, I cared about the design and price) but you should always ask for a comment when making a personal targeted piece like this, or it's just a hit piece.\n\n>Irrelevant since they stil promised to send the prototype back at least twice but didnt and essentially stole it. What they wanted to do with isnt important to the issue at all.\n\nYeah, I agree with you on that one. How it was sold doesn't matter if it was sold. He can say what went wrong, but selling and auctioning aren't that different.\n\nNot the original guy who disagreed with you, but I personally think that GN should have asked for comment and it's fucked up that he didn't. Without a comment from Linus, the piece GN made was completely one sided against him with only input from Linus that GN chose to show from WAN clips and other sources like it. That's the point of asking for comment, so that the other person can either tell their side or get caught lying and get into even worse trouble.\n\nIt's irrelevant what his reaction to GN's video was and it's also irrelevant if he did or didn't have anything to comment with, it doesn't mean GN shouldn't have tried to ask for one. It was a journalistic piece about someone else's journalistic integrity, you have to do your best to not fuck up your own integrity when doing that.\n\nEven with LLT being 95% in the wrong and needs to fix their shit, GN should have known better and not double down on it later. He even talked about walking on eggshells to avoid pissing LTT fans being a problem in the tech youtuber community, but then goes and completely leaves Linus out of the discussion and leaves a lot of people with lacking information who are now rioting. It's a thousand times harder to give more info after the fact than during the first journalistic piece and Steve should know that.",

I already said that excluding the review which I was fine with, everything else LTT was accused of is a serious problem and they need to fix their shit. I just also believe GN needs to follow basic journalistic integrity if he want's to do a targeted piece on a person about their journalistic integrity. He wasn't wrong with what he said in the video for the most part, but he shouldn't have not asked for a comment and he shouldn't have doubled down on that take after the fact. How does that make me a fanboy? Linus needs to fix his company or it will die, but this sub has some serious accusation issues going as well. Everyone is evil, greedy etc, except the guy who made an expose, he can't make mistakes, even though he said in the video that he also makes mistakes.",

If Linus answered something stupid, like he did on the forums, then GN could have shat on it right away. If he said nothing of relevance, they could have just shown it at the end of the video as many news sources do when reaching out for comments. If Linus refused to answer then GN would have just put out the generic \"We reached out for a comment from X but haven't received one as of this video.\"\n\nThere's nothing specific he had to do about it, but if you are going to question other people involved (They reached out to Billet) then GN should have also tried to get a comment from Linus. Nothing more to it, if you do investigative work with sources that had information that wasn't 100% public, then GN should have also asked for LTT for comment on that. Worst case scenario could have been that Billet was lying and everything they said was fabricated, but thankfully that wasn't the case. But just... ask for a comment when making a investigative journalistic piece about someone's journalistic integrity... It's not complex.",

This wasn't something Steve had to find, he was already cutting that part of the WAN show.\n\n> Yes. I understood this. GN mischaracterized it, but that was likely out of emotion and not malice or spite. Linus was also posting out of emotion, and should have just waited until he was in a calmer headspace.\n\nLoose loose here. If Linus waited, he would be called out for ignoring it. He wanted to get his side out, so he did. Nothing he wrote would have made the people seeing red happy, hell people are even calling it a generic corporate response, when it very much isn't. This is also why you won't see another one from Linus to WAN show at the earliest, he has nothing to gain from it, and every response gives Steve another video to keep the rage going.\n\n>I see your point, but there is no way in hell the particular complaints in those clips hasn’t been brought up internally many, many, many times.\n\nI'm pretty sure he's aware of the problem, and is planning to use Labs to fix it, as well as having the CEO take some of this work so he can focus more on videos. Something time will tell.\n\n>The Billet Labs controversy is basically the other points coming to a head. It’s a problem long brewing and it just so happens to be a very public illustration of the carelessness addressed in the other points.\n\nIt really depends if the Billet thing is a once off fuckup, or if something similar has happen before.\n\n\n>Long and short, Gamers Nexus was mostly correct.

If LTT goes scorched earth, then their credibility takes a major hit.\n\nI guess the question is, what changes do you expect this to make?\n\nMost would say the Billet compensation, but I also find it hard to believe they wouldn't have compensated them beforehand, it was just in the process. But it's something we will never know, so it honestly can't be called a win either way.\n\nIn terms of the quality of thier data, I feel this was the whole point of the labs, and the labs was working up to getting it all ready. I think the part people are missing is that the labs isn't fully running yet, so the improvements aren't there. Maybe it will cause the new CEO to get people to pay a bit more attention and give them a bit of extra time, which would be great, but I don't think likely.\n\nAn absolute win for GN though would be people not trusting LTT anymore and fully trusting him, which is why I feel the whole thing is very manipulative.\n\nAlso appreciate the honest a civil discussion on this. Currently saying anything GN said was potentially misleading or wrong gets you ironically called a shill and dogpiled.",

The data part is, but then there's a lot of hearsay and he-said-she-said.

One is way more malicious.\n\nYou can't really claim no plan for compensation, as we don't know what happened inside LMG between the ask for compensation and the video releasing, due to the extremely short time period. It's acutally not unlikely that the process to compensate had started as soon as they worked out it was sold incorrectly. LMG is not one person, and 100+ people companies are slow and have pretty full on processes for this kind of thing (or there was no process at all, and behind the scenes they where trying to work out how to handle it)\n\n>wether Linus watches it or not isnt the important thing, what’s important is to share the issues with the community, whatever LMG does after that is their business (and what they’ve done is make an incredibly tone deaf response trying to make it seem like they’re the victims in all this)\n\nI don't read it as they're trying to make themselves the victims. Linus was annoyed he wasn't asked about it. He was also clearly annoyed that the billet thing happened, and apologised for misreading the community on the testing.\n\nHe also accepted the data quality issues (which he has accepted before this) and noted the labs was ramping up processes to fix it.",

Linus then said it was resolved and he'd pay what they want. What we don't know is what happened once LMG got that email, what process or discussions happened, and if Linus knew about the problem at all. Something that if Steve had asked we would have found out and could be included.\n\n>In the first place, it was a screw up that the block was sold!

Yet from the excerpt we see in the GN video, no apology is offered by LMG, just a bizarre message painting the auction as a good thing: \"the good news, is that it isn't just sitting on a shelf\"\n\n\n\nAugust 10th: **Billet reaches out to LMG 10 minutes after receiving the above communication**, asking if they will be reimbursed for the prototype, indicating it was expensive. LMG does not respond.\n\n\n\nAugust 14th: LMG writes back to Billet, claiming they will pay the price stated in their email, **but only 2-3 hours after the GN video goes up, and before Billet has a chance to respond to that email, Linus communicates on the LTT forum \\~3 hours after the GN video goes live that they've already worked out an agreement with Billet to reimburse them for the cost of the prototype (when in reality this had not yet been confirmed)**.\n\n\n\nThis is incredibly disappointing behaviour by Linus because it just goes to show he never cared about any of this until it blew up in his face. And then once it blew up, he manipulated the situation to make himself look like the victim, including these selective statements about the timeline of events to get ahead of the criticism that Billet labs got screwed.\n\n\n\nGN's claim that Linus is gaslighting everyone really makes you think. Was this another mistake where Linus genuinely does not know what he did wrong? Or was this malicious in the sense that Linus: 1) boiled the screwup down to money; 2) claimed to have already had an agreement to repay that money when he didn't; 3) played semantics with the timeline so people defending him online would spread misinformation on his behalf ('Billet labs has already been repaid for the prototype', etc.)\n\n\n\nHanlon's razor and all that, but this was a terrible response from Linus and it's worrying that a lot of LTT's followers would've taken it at face value if not for Steve's criticism in these two GN videos.\"",

Because you're acting as if you were a moral person while being immoral for clout, prestige or whatever else you want to call it. Corporations very rarely give to charity because they want to GIVE. They give to charity because they hope to profit in terms of their public image. Being seen as a morally good company influences a lot of buyer decisions and if you're a social media company, you even get rabid stans ready to defend you online in dozens of comments despite the fact that you're objectively wrong.\n\nNot to mention selling something you claimed yourself MULTIPLE TIMES is worthless, senseless, shouldn't be bought or whatever is hypocrisy in it's finest form. You trashed the product? Gee golly wiz, send it back to the producer, why would you keep something that bad?",

The response LMG has provided to GN's videos also pretty clearly points out that they have no plans to fix any of it, because none of their responses are about fixing the underlying issues.\n\n>Also get some insite into the process that caused the Billet issue and what's been done to fix it.\n\nWhy? That doesn't change the underlying issue he's bringing up with the whole Billet Fiasco. It's not about just that, it's not about the process that caused them to accidentally sell the monoblock. These are all results of the underlying issue of pushing your staff hard to produce more and more content at the expense of the quality and care said content should have.\n\nEven if they made massive improvements to address the issue of accidentally selling stuff they get for reviews, that doesn't change the underlying point GN's video is making.\n\n>The video is not a review. All LTT reviews are labeled. It's also a prototype, so a review is pointless.\n\nYou know what's one of the first results when you type in \"Billet Labs review\" in youtube? It's the LTT video. Whether it's *labeled* as a review is irrelevant since it comes off as such and then comes with a recommendation on whether or not you should buy the product. It has every hallmark of a review even if not labeled as such.\n\nEven if it is not a review, it still has an impact, LTT is one of the biggest tech channels out there. What they say **matters** and they should be aware of that. Even when making \"non-reviews\" or impressions or unboxings, they still need to do their due diligence with the products they're looking at.\n\n>It was a showcase of a potentially cool product, and Linus provided feedback on what the issue was with it, and it wasn't the performance.\n\nThe feedback he provided was directly in relation to it's performance. [The best case scenario for this thing is that the temps are slightly better but the experience with building with it is a nightamre and the advantages of any other solution are negligable.](https://youtu.be/P2hey3mNnN0?t=1159) As in, the performance gained, is not worth the hassle of building with it. With better performance it might be worth it.\n\nHowever you have to keep in mind that the literal founder of the company commented on the video [\"Pretty much every design issue Linus raised was done for a reason which was all explained to Adam weeks ago, none of which (I guess) were fed back to Linus. We also sent a full instruction manual that seemingly wasn't used.\"](https://youtu.be/FGW3TPytTjc?t=1845)\n\nSo we have Linus stating that the product is a nightmare to work with when:\n\na) Issues they raised were done for a reason which were all explained to the team, but Linus never brought this up in the video.\n\nb) Full instruction manual was provided that LMG failed to utilize when installing this extremely niche product.\n\nThen says that it provides negligible benefit over competition when they in fact tested it on the wrong card and can't make judgements on performance.\n\nAll of that brings the entire conclusion of the video into question.\n\nIf Linus had the instruction manual would it have been easier to work with?\n\nIf Adam had explained why these decisions were made, would the product make more sense to Linus?\n\nIf it was tested on the proper card would the performance be better?\n\n>Problem is watching the video would betray his teams trust, and then you'd have one of these incidents all over again.\n\nThankfully, Linus, as an adult human being is capable of opening his mouth and talking. He is able to communicate with his staff and the people in the video to ask their permission to view it, or simply let them know that certain clips of that video were present in another video. I very much doubt the staff would explode over this, since Linus had no way of knowing that GN would use those clips.\n\nLinus should also be consulting his staff on the potential issues their approach content creation create to begin with.\n\n>Absolutely he called them on reasonable things. It just felt manipulative how it was done. Benefit of the doubt tells me it wasn't deliberate by GN, but that doesn't mean the video can't be criticized, especially as it a critique itself about accuracy.\n\nI just don't see what you mean by manipulative. There was no personal bias in there, there was no opinion based reporting or some random reddit posts mentioned. It was simply him, looking at LMG videos and stating they have a lot of issues and then using Billet as main and pretty egregious example of those issues. I simply can't see manipulation in there at all.\n\n>But things like calling Short Circuits reviews is misleading\n\nAgain, just because they're not labeled as \"reviews\" doesn't mean they don't come as such. Like if you write in \"Pwnage Stormbreaker review\" short circuit is for me the second video on the result list, and by far the most viewed one in there. It absolutely comes off as a review, even if not labeled as such.\n\nThe video itself goes over the main points of the mouse, the dude does some testing, gives his impressions of it and eventually gives his own recommendation of the product. Like this absolutely comes off as a review.\n\nEven if it is not a review and GN is misleadingly calling it as such, it still holds the same *weight* as a review which LMG should recognize. Like to your average consumer, whether or not something is called a review doesn't matter. They look at a video, and see the conclusions of it and it impacts their purchase decision. Especially on a channel the size of Short Circuit.\n\nLinus and LMG in general, should be aware of this, and aware that any mistakes they make in their first impressions, reviews, or any other content, can and will impact the people and companies involved with that.\n\nThis is why doing your research and making sure the things you say and write are correct is important. Because you have a loud voice with which to speak with.\n\n>And missing the charity line is misleading, regardless of impact.\n\nWhy is the charity bit important? What does it change about what happened?\n\nThe \"impressions\" of the product were still based on erroneous and incorrect data.\n\nThe product was still sold, albeit for a good cause, but sold nonetheless.\n\nThe underlying issue here, is that LMG did a thing with a prototype product that they did not get an approval for from the manufacturer, what LMG did caused the product to be lost and thus unable to returned to the manufacturer.\n\nThis was also not a simple accident since I doubt that auction products are just random shit random employees find and throw on the showfloor. Rather this was a calculated decision to sell the prototype product, most likely erroneously against the agreement with the manufacturer, but sold nonethelss.\n\nI don't see how charity matters in this case, please explain why it matters and what it changes?\nWhy does it being sold off to charity matter?",

Sure I am commenting so late after I have the luxury that others clapped back with better words than I probably could have but even if it was fresh I still wouldn't have replied. That person typed out such that I am either not getting a reply or I get an argument. Either way it has become a waste of my time.

All of this will likely never happen with Linus and his wife being majority owners of the company and having final say.\n\nBut that's just like, my opinion, man",

I think there is decent chance that things might be very different if LMG had time to react. In a manner that does not benefit this community\n\nMaybe, but my thought one what would happen is:\n\n- Linus didn't realises, goes oh shit and reaches out to Billet\n\n- Steve posts the video still but adds a line saying Linus did reach out to Billet to resolve the issue once GN made them aware.\n\nIt still looks bad for Linus, looks even better for Steve, but does take some of the rage out of it, which is why I think it didn't happen. Steve would have 100% known Linus was unaware of the issue, and that LTT wouldn't respond within the business day they had due to their size.\n\n>context for billet cooler. I mean the video was very long already and the Steve's point was not so much that LMG did not recommend the cooler, but the time and effort put in to the review.\n\nThis one comes down to if you consider it review or a showcase. As it's a protoype and not production, I see it as a showcase. Whatever performance they got was irrelevant, because you wouldn't be able to buy that item. I can see why Linus didn't bother correcting it, but I agree it was the wrong thing to do. I always remember that video as standing out for being really terrible.\n\nA lot of this is something I've noticed with Linus. He really struggles when he thinks people don't understand the points he's making. It can cause him to come across as an arrogant dickhead, when that's not what he's trying to do. I sympathize here because I regularly have the same problem.",

If that's the case, then this argument is dumb because what they sent wasn't a finished product, they sent a prototype to get some feedback on their performance and their design (as well as to get some publicity).\n\n>Leaving out the auction was for charity (this is what Linus was correcting in his response, not the selling to auction)\n\nI see that you didn't actually watch the video (just like Linus).

The \"tech Jesus\" thing is more of a joke about his hair more than anything. And in fact I think Jay has way more haters than actual fans/viewers lol. LTT on the other hand has kinda garnered this weird cult following over the years that has seemed to start unraveling slowly over the last few years.",
