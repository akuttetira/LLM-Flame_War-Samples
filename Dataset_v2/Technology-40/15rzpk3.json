I’m 38 and I have a vivid memory of getting home from school for lunch and watching the second plane hit live on TV and hearing the slow realization amongst the newscasters that it was a terrorist attack and not just an accident.\n\nI guess it’s the same for people who lived through the Kennedy Assassination or the PLQ terrorist attacks. Like you just have this event that everyone around you can relate to and then all of a sudden you look around and that collective memory starts to fade because so many more people just didn’t experience it first hand.",
