People to stop being abused, and for an abused worker to get compensation.\n\nNone of that is unreasonable, and people downplaying it and wanting the controversy to fade away for LMG are directly fighting against that happening; people like you.\n\n\n>You want blood in the hate parasocial relationship that you have.\n\nThis literally makes no sense, and is just more evidence of you trying to pretend that serious evidence of a horrible time crunched work place environment and sloppy rushed consumer advice should all be reduced down to somehow being dismissed as \"parasocial relationship\"s. This is you trying your best to flip the script, projecting what you are doing onto me.\n\nIt's not unreasonable to verbalize criticism for an awful company that otherwise will continue to get away with their bad practices. It's called having empathy, and not allowing your mind to be altered by parasocial relationships making you blind to harm caused.\n\n>You are taking the comments of one, as fact,\n\nI'm taking the victims word, backed by circumstance with the confirmed to be awful workplace environment, with crunch being an absolute, mistreatment being reported by multiple employees, and dismissal of serious workplace incidents being corroborated by multiple employees. Only the specifics are un confirmed in this, so to say that we are being unreasonable to not call a victim of this a liar, victim blaming out of misplaced love for a corporation, is insane.\n\n> and thinking they must be all terrible cause they all are terrible and lie and work to much and can't be happy.\n\nThis is blatantly a strawman, where you are very obviously inserting imaginary elements into my argument as you cannot argue against my action opinion on its own, where you pretend that anything I've suggested would push the message that *every person* in the company is responsible, as opposed to the obvious thing I am saying where this is a top down problem, with the owners primarily responsible with a depreciating slope of responsibility as we flow down the chain. To maliciously imply that I am some how also blaming the box packers is completely in bad faith.\n\n>Just wait and listen.\n\nThis strategy is how victims get ignored with the massive leverage corporations have vs workers. There needs to be noise for LMG to have to face this head on. Either they vindicate themselves of some specifics, or they get found out. One thing is for sure though, we have enough information to know there needs to be significant change at this media company.\n\n>Stop assuming they are the worse place in the world.\n\nThis is once again a strawman, where you maliciously exaggerate the sentiment I am expressing so that you can pretend that you are appealing to reason, when in fact, as has been mentioned multiple times, what people want is for victims to be compensated, and for the quality of treatment of employees to improve. None of that suggests this is \"the worst place in the world\". It suggests that we should value other people, have empathy, and support workers against corporation in a time of strife.\n\n>If you want to assume they are all terrible, go ahead, live in that hate. It isn't healthy.\n\nThe counterpoint to this, is clearly you are letting a parasocial relationship with a large multimillion dollar youtube media company blind you to basic compassion others are showing, allowing you to somehow interpret criticism of this companies poor treatment of workers as somehow being unreasonable hate.\n\nSeeing your name though, I could totally imagine if this was trolling given the lack of quality in that post.",

I feel bad for her if that was what she went though.\n\nI have felt mistreated in a work place, and have been on the wrong side of things.  It sucks. I can't speak to all the harassment, but I can speak to a negative work place that drains you of life.\n\nMy problem is that her timing is hella suspect. She chose now when she felt people would be on her side. I want to believe her, but past experiences of trusting someones allegations have me concerned.\n\nShe voiced that she held back what she would say in fear of this community doing what it is doing now.  Being an unreasonable mob that is out for blood and wants to tear down the establishment.\n\nShe also mentions in her story, that HR didn't always know what was going on, and they didn't know what was happening cause she didn't tell them.\n\nMadison also mentioned that Linus said publicly he wouldn't address anything, and as long as no one says anything he is innocent hehehe....\n\nThat is projecting. It was a standard response and she read into it what she wanted too.\n\nI think there is more to this, and I am waiting.  I think this dogpiling is crazy.  Its a pitchfork sale and people are a buying!\n\nI hope the truth comes out.\n\nLinus has had credibility.  LMG has responded to criticism and addressed concerns if not fully backed out of stuff.  He has offered transparency and acknowledged when they can improve.  This community has forgotten how much he has helped create a nerd tech space, and bolstered other creators.\n\nHow this has been relegated and forgotten about is so disingenuous.",

Probably main reason is Linus rushing them. Accidentally auctioning off a prototype, that's quite unfortunate. In the light of the whole story none of them a dealbreaker.\n\nLinus on the other hand with going solo responding in a forum post, now that was an asshole thing to do, he made everything a thousand times worse. I am truly angry he did not even take into care that there is a team behind him, he is responsible for.\nBut they seemed genuinenly happy, relieved and excited about the new chapter in LMG's life (except for Linus)\n\nAs for Madison, I will have to wait for investigations to conclude, it's easy to jump the gun and blame linus since he was an asshole in the past few days, but that doesn't necessarily means there wasn't any misunderstanding, or miss communication.\n\nI see it can be hard for people to stay objective. Whether Madison was right, or there were other factors even she wasn't avare.\n\nWhat I am worried about that stirring up the whole thing and not letting LMG and Madison handle this privately...  old wounds are gonna be torn up, and that is what you really don't want in her case, mental health is no joke.",

Moreover, he - or at least LMG - have also been actively censoring comments on their Youtube videos. I don't know how you weigh those things against each other.",
