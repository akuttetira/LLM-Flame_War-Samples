Bullshit.\n\nhttps://gizmodo.com/reddit-blackout-protest-traffic-back-up-subreddit-1850570817\n\nThe “definite shift” is that people realized this was pointless and they got bored trying to virtue signal for karma. The protest was a gigantic waste from the very beginning, the rest of us told you from day 1 people wouldn’t commit, and they haven’t. Only a handful of subs are still maintaining the protest and most of the ones I’ve seen are doing so against the wishes of their users.\n\nThe fact that you people have turned this into yet another tribal issue where you can either be a reasonable person or a full blown corporate shill is just really sad and immature. Distorting reality to make yourself feel like you’re “winning” is even more sad and immature. All for some rich dude and a bunch of power-tripping mods.",
