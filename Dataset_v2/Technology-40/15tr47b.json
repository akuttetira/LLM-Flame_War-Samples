    "post_text ": "First and foremost Linus is catching a lot of deserved flak for some very bad moves that have come to light. I am also aware a post in defense of any aspect of Linus' actions is gonna come off as dickriding, but check my post history I'm not just blindly ignoring inconvenient details following my parasocial bestie.\n\nThat said, I think Hanlon's razor here is valid. What makes more sense - a small company's proprietary property with malice and forethought was stolen and auctioned for a few hundred bucks at a convention, or an inventory mismanagement error. Like, it's not enough money to embroil yourself in exactly this backlash and end up potentially paying much more in an open-and-shut lawsuit.\n\nLinus and team were dumb as fuck for the Billet labs situation, and they're rightfully receiving a paddlin'. That said, they're addressing it *decently* well.\n\nWith the Madison situation, either Linus flew her all the way out to pursposefully torture her to the point of self harm, or he stupidly gave a very young person way too heavy a workload in a very unclear position in the company. Then, when she brought up complaints the entire HR process was effectively useless, either intentionally or just by a colossal misjudgement and mishandling of the situation on many employees' parts.\n\nIt kinda seems like stupidity here is a very likely explanation, though a possibility of malice exists. They will take lumps for what's happened, even if it was stupidity. These are not the kinds of things you can waffle as a business. That said, I feel like painting the crew as pure evil is a shallow take.\n\n\nEdit: A bunch of people have pointed out those who bullied Madison were being malicious, I would agree.",

Or where they left a dell laptop in the rain that was supposed be returned to Dell.\n\nThis is 100% a company culture problem that has been handed down from Linus.",

The “if they were going to use it for a future build” was “we thought” not “we had an agreement.\n\nSo they gave it to LTT telling them they could keep it, and then after they got a negative review, asked for it back. Thats why it was in LTT’s inventory as belonging to LTT - because it did. LTT owned it until they agreed to return it, but then they fucked up returning it because the writer went on vacation and dealing with the return got lost (probably in pre LTX craziness).\n\nMy question is why BL and GN never mention anywhere that they gave it LTT with the intention of LTT keeping it, and claim instead they were going to use it for future product development.  Even if they had just lent the block for future builds (which I don’t think they did or LTT would accept), there was no way BL could have expected to use it for product development as the GN video claims.\n\nVery sus.",

I’m in mid prep for a giant convention, with staff on vacation.\n\nAnd BL omitting the information in statements and the GN video is suspicious, and a reason not to trust BL.

You're inventing stories outside of what has already been established.\n\nWe know that they sent the item for review and were fine with them using it if they were going to use it for more than one project. When they found out that they weren't going to be used for more than one project they asked for it back. LMG could have told them no but they didn't, likely because they understood that it belonged to Billet labs. They agreed on two separate occasions, well before LTX, to return it. By saying that they would return it they acknowledged that it belonged to Billit labs. Then LMG goes around and sells it? How is that at all Billet lab's fault?\n\nConspiracy theory stuff just drives me up the wall. We have a history of events. We know exactly what happened and in what order. LMG just screwed up. Gamers Nexus was not orchestrating some kind of conspiracy against them. They looked at the quality of LMGs work and called it into question and when they found out about the Billet labs thing, they picked it up and ran with it because it was more evidence of LMG's Crunch and quality control problems.\n\nAnd if you come and say oh we haven't seen the emails, so they could be making it up. That's just a facetious argument. Not a single one of the parties involved have made allegations or claimed that things are any different than the way Billet labs and Gamers Nexus have presented.\n\nSometimes a dog is a dog is a dog and the simplest explanation is the correct one.\n\nThis conspiracy theory stuff reminds me of the 911 truthers. The actual evidence doesn't fit the conspiracy theory so they claim the evidence is made up and massage the story until it fits the narrative they've made up in their heads. Don't do that. It's not how the real world works.",

This is a problem with people interacting on the internet.\n\nThat's not something that Gamers Nexus has responsibility for. For the most part, their video was pretty much even handed and to the point. LMG has NOT been handling errors very well and their quality control has been poor. Linus DID make the video with the Billet block and he DID do a crappy job with it he DID downplay the need to be accurate and do things correctly. LMG DID screw up and auction off something that they had promised to give back to the manufacturer. Madison's claims about behavior at LMG are fairly believable given what we know about what some of the staff there have said on camera and the tech industry in general.\n\nAll of those are things that Gamers Nexus can't take the blame for.

It's not that hard to create a system where anything in inventory has a inventory tag and you have a database that is required to be used when things are taken in and out. The inventory database says who took it out and what project it is being used for. You hold people accountable for the inventory system with discipline if they don't follow the rules.  You can even have a quarterly logistical cleanup where everyone has to account for the items that they have checked out.\n\nThis would allow you to know where everything is at any one time or at least keep the chaos down.\n\nAny item that is from outside that needs to be returned to a vendor would be given a separate inventory tag. That would be an inventory tag that is different than General inventory tags. All items that are part of that lot of things that need to be returned would be stored in a box together with an inventory sheet in the Box stating what came with it.\n\nThe problem here is that they received the items, didn't inventory it properly and then separated the items. Colton was looking for things to auction off saw the block, didn't know that it was attached to anything or was tagged for anything and sold it. This was a problem with their internal Logistics and their failure to hold their staff accountable for proper logistical tracking.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I know that Logistics in this sort of setting is undoubtedly difficult. But if you get a good culture in place and you hold people accountable for not following the rules, things will improve. Clearly that was not the case here.",

From what we've heard, the block was in fact tagged in their system as LMG property because that's what Billet Labs originally represented it would be.

It's not hard to imagine that any logistics system will have a hard time dealing with one-off situations like companies deciding that they changed their mind about the terms of an arrangement.",
