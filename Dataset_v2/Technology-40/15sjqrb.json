This reeks of bro culture and a lack of HR nor a PR team. The sexual harassment, terrible expectations of how many videos need to be put out constantly and responses to all the allegations just show how bad LTT really is.\n\nRather than apologize to Billet Labs in PR 101, they doubled down until GN came out. The experiences that Madison faced reminds of me of Blizzard and Riot Games when female employees came out with similar experiences. I really can't see LTT the same anymore, they lost a lot of trust in the community.",

Teamsters recently elected a new president, ousting the legacy Hoffa. Then by threatening to strike, very recently got a new contract for UPS that is a significant pay increase, and addressed several other concerns, such as air conditioning in all new package cars, ending the two-tier wage system, etc.\n\nIt's hard, and it sucks, but the best thing to do for yourself as a worker is to unionize.",
