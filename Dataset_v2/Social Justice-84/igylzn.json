            "Reply_Text": "MGTOW are not incels because they claim to be “voluntarily” not “involuntarily” celibate. That is to say they’ve walked away from relationships, marriages etc because the pressure society has put on them have made them enter into relationships they weren’t overly happy with. They walk away from it all selfishly (not that being selfish is bad) so that they “go there own way” and focus on themselves.\n\nSounds reasonable. A bunch of men that feel that they’ve been screwed over in American court systems.\n\nBut at the end of the day, they aren’t truly happy. The problems they’ve faced they blame only on women. They take no responsibility for failed relationships outside of “I should have known she’d do this”. They are devoid of connection and love and they truly believe that’s the way to be. They believe that women only love you for the chase and when you marry them they lose interest but take no responsibility or hold no acknowledgement that relationship require work, upkeep and excitement from both parties even after you have kids and are married etc.\n\nI’d go as far to say most of them are men whose parents didn’t give them enough love. Now they don’t know how to love, how to be responsible for their failed relationships and have written off relationships to the point of thinking all relationships fail BECAUSE of women.\n\nIncels are disgusting creatures that need to take a good hard look at themselves. MGTOW is toxic bullshit, but man I can’t help feeling pity for them. It’s actually really a sad way to live and it’s hard to debate this with them because they make many points which are true and valid to them. A lot of the time you debate people they just argue back with illogical nonsense to the style of a trump supporter.\n\nBut with MGTOW the ones that are really down with it make points and reasoning which you can understand why they got to that viewpoint. Whether it’s wrong or not is out of the question, but you can almost empathise with the how and why they are the way they are.\n\nLike I said it’s genuinely a really sad way to live IMO. One recent post was from a guy who took a day off that month to fly interstate to see his favourite escort and then fly back in time for his nightly routine. That to me screams sad and lonely not happy. A sub like that (which promotes showcasing success of men who have gone to live without relationships) will also always attract bigots who just hate women.\n\nBut you can see what they are going for, as skewed as it is.",
