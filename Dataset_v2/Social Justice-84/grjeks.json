But they committed in my book one of the biggest crimes of humanity.\nThey should be persecuted on the spot. Kill them\n\nAh yes. Gay people existing is somehow a crime against humanity, but genocide is not. That's lovely.\n\nBy the way, [here's the link to the original comment on Ceddit. ](https://snew.notabug.io/r/unpopularopinion/comments/gqyff4/lgbtq_mega_thread/frz2fme/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) I'm not sure how other archive sites work, so I just pulled it up using that.",
