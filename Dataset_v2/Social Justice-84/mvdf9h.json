But no apparently America-a country which couldn’t even contain the Coronavirus and struggled to stop a domestic Capitol insurrection-somehow can have hundreds of people from many different backgrounds be super secret CIA disinformation agents just to get Americans to not like China, although most Americans have had an unfavorable view of China for decades. The simpler explanation in this case is that yes, the genocide is real. China simultaneously viewing America as both a fallen degenerate empire and some shadowy cabal that can control the world is both contradictory and pathetic. Denying the Uighur genocide would involve viewing America as being far more powerful than it actually is. America has and can make propaganda about it’s enemies but denying the Uighur genocide is a borderline conspiracy theory as we have years of evidence and proof. Actually, Uighur genocide denial IS a conspiracy theory.",

She said she was tortured and later gang-raped on three occasions, each time by two or three men.\n\n>Ziawudun has spoken to the media before, but only from Kazakhstan, where she \"lived in constant fear of being sent back to China\", she said. She said she believed that if she revealed the extent of the sexual abuse she had experienced and seen, and was returned to Xinjiang, she would be punished more harshly than before. And she was ashamed, she said.\n\nSo that explains the contradiction. She gave a lesser story against China when she was afraid of getting sent back, and only after she felt safer did she open up. This is pretty consistent with rape victims who will take months or even years to come forward. Rape is exceedingly traumatizing and difficult to talk about.\n\nIs that your only \"debunk\" of witness testimony, two sources where you completely glossed over the context and the information within the article itself?",

A lot of rape victims do that. In fact she's acted pretty consistent with how a lot of rape victims respond to their trauma:\n\nShame:\n\n>One of the primary reasons women don’t come forward to report sexual harassment or assault is shame. Shame is at the core of the intense emotional wounding women and men experience when they are sexually violated. As expert on shame Gershen Kaufman aptly stated in his book Shame: The Power of Caring, “Shame is a natural reaction to being violated or abused. In fact, abuse, by its very nature, is humiliating and dehumanizing.” This is especially true with sexual violations. The victim feels invaded and defiled, while simultaneously experiencing the indignity of being helpless and at the mercy of another person.\n\nDenial, Minimization\n\n>This tendency to blame themselves and to be overwhelmed with shame leads into the next important reason why women don’t come forward: denial and minimization. Many women refuse to believe that the treatment they endured was actually abusive. They downplay how much they have been harmed by sexual harassment and even sexual assault. They convince themselves that “it wasn’t a big deal.”\n\nFear of the Consequences\n\n>Fear of the repercussions is a huge obstacle women face when it comes to reporting sexual harassment or assault — fear of losing their job, fear they won’t find another job, fear they will be passed over for a promotion, fear of losing their credibility, fear of being branded a troublemaker, fear of being blackballed in their industry, fear of their physical safety. This is true whether it is a case of a young woman in her first job being harassed, an actress trying to make her way in the entertainment business, or a career woman desperately trying to break through the glass ceiling.\n\n>Many don’t disclose, because they fear they won’t be believed, and until very recently, that has primarily been the case. The fact that sexual misconduct is the most under-reported crime is due to a common belief that women make up these stories for attention or to get back at a man who rejected them. Victims' accounts are often scrutinized to the point of exhaustion. In high-profile cases, victims are often labeled opportunists, blamed for their own victimization, and punished for coming forward.\n\n>Another reason why victims don’t report or delay reporting is that they fear retaliation, and we have evidence from recent events to validate that fear. Sexual harassers frequently threaten the lives, jobs, and careers of their victims. And many victims are frightened by the perpetrator’s position of power and what he could do with it.\n\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-compassion-chronicles/201711/why-dont-victims-sexual-harassment-come-forward-sooner\n\nSo she's acted logical consistent for a legitimate victim. If you don't believe her, it's because you don't want to believe her for ideological reasons and not because you're being reasonable and non-biased about the issue.\n\nAnd you didn't answer my question. Is that your only example of witness testimony being debunked? Because that wasn't a legitimate example by any means.",
