They knew about it for years, and were well aware it was a cesspool of hate and violence.  I even had a [conversation](https://np.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/gvck5g/what_is_the_proper_way_for_mods_to_escalate_a/) with an admin about the proper way to report it.\n\nAll they did during the “banwave” is ban two mods at WG.  That allowed the community to reconstitute elsewhere, here on Reddit and remaining mods shill for their shitty .win site, which Reddit is still advertising at r/weekendgunnit.\n\nSpez is a prepper, [planning for an apocalypse where he'll be in charge, and you'll be his slave](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/30/doomsday-prep-for-the-super-rich).

And those are the relatively better cops. Of course, most police in most interactions aren't why people are protesting, but it really shows how deplorable their overall mindsets can be.\n\nAnd I'm kind of convinced that Tucker_Carlson isn't banned because Reddit is afraid of public pushback from the man himself.",
