Liberals still have in groups because they support capitalism which is dependant on 2 distinct classes those that work for business and those that own business. Only one of those groups has any real power. But thanks for the link I'll check it out, that quote about the law is very accurate. But yeah liberals are rightwing economically",

Sometimes I get uneasy when people say the rich and well off are making us fight against each other, not because they don't or can't, but because *where I grew up* didn't really have rich people (visible rich people, that is) and I saw a lot of what you describe - self-created, self-maintained.\n\nPeople subdivided themselves to create further divides when we were all just poor by the rest of the standards of the country. So, the people making $40k were super-ultra rich, and everyone below that just kind of accepted that they deserved to be poor, but simultaneously it was the (racial group/religious group/sub-$20ks) that were keeping them down.\n\nJust a maelstrom of hate and awfulness without any apparent end, but simultaneously one that could've been ended just by acknowledging that... Hey, none of us are actually that different.\n\nHurts still to think about.",
