It also makes an effective entry point to bring people into other, harder right-wing positions as they get acclimated to thinking of people in terms of \"deviancy\" or \"degenerateness\". Once you have something thinking the people who dress up as animals are \"sub-human degenerates\", it's easier to get them to apply that same mindset to other marginalized groups.",

No, you fucking sociopath! I DON'T think the attempted murder of thousands isn't funny! Had the attack happened *literally anywhere else* she'd have lost her fucking job!\n\nAnd yet it was every response, on every website! No matter where I went or who I talked to, nobody was taking this goddamn terrorist act seriously! I was screaming internally nonstop. I don't think they ever found whoever did it either. The thought that someone could attempt to end the lives of thousands and not only get away, but be treated as if their mass murder plot was \"no big deal\" and \"actually kinda funny\" drives me completely insane. I feel sick even thinking about it. I'm not exaggerating when I say that either. I physically may just vomit.",
