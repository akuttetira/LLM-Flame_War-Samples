    "Post_Title": "Steve “Spez” Huffman is finally claiming that Black Lives Matter, but has spent years as CEO defending white supremacy and racism on Reddit",
    "post_text ": "Late last night Steve “u/spez” Huffman, CEO of Reddit, posted a letter on the reddit blog [“Remember the Human – Black Lives Matter”]( https://redditblog.com/2020/06/01/remember-the-human-black-lives-matter/).  In this letter, Steve claims that his heart is heavy and “as Snoos, we do not tolerate hate, racism, and violence, and while we have work to do to fight these on our platform, our values are clear.”\n\nSteve Huffman is also a liar.\n\nSteve does not care about black lives and never has.  In fact, Steve has spent his entire career at Reddit defending white nationalism and endorsing racism on this website.\n\nSteve has passively stood by for well over a decade as white nationalists have built forums on this site and has only taken action once the media has got wind of it.\n\n/r/N*****S was created in 2008 and all Reddit did was mark the subreddit as NSFW and let it grow to tens of thousands of members before it was banned FIVE YEARS later in 2013.\n\n* [Does Anything Go? The Rise and Fall of a Racist Corner of Reddit](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/07/does-anything-go-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-racist-corner-of-reddit/277585/) – The Atlantic, 2013\n\nOf course, once /r/N*****S was banned, the same racists just made a new subreddit and started over again.  A process they have done time after time growing bigger in every new instance.  From /r/GreatApes, to /r/Coontown, to /r/WhiteRights, /r/GasTheKikes, /r/NationalSocialism, /r/AntiPozi, /r/Altright, /r/European, /r/CringeAnarchy, and more.\n\nUsers on the notorious white nationalist website Daily Stormer made a post in 2015 explaining that [“Reddit is Fertile Ground for Recruitment”](http://archive.is/7lQiA)\n\nThis brings us to /r/The_Donald, a subreddit that has been widely reported as a hot bed for white nationalism and calls for violence.  It took Steve Huffman years before they even quarantined the subreddit and the only reason it is now silent is because the moderators decided to move to a new website.  \n\n* [Racists Are Recruiting. Watch Your White Sons.]( https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/12/opinion/sunday/white-supremacist-recruitment.html)- New York Times, 2019\n\n* [Day of the trope: White nationalist memes thrive on Reddit's r/The_Donald]( https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/04/19/day-trope-white-nationalist-memes-thrive-reddits-rthedonald) – SPLC, 2018\n\n* [Reddit Ban Hasn’t Stopped Trump Fans From Calling for Murder of Parkland Kids, Immigrants, and Antifa]( https://www.thedailybeast.com/reddit-ban-hasnt-stopped-trump-fans-from-calling-for-murder-of-parkland-kids-immigrants-and-antifa/?via=twitter_page) – Daily Beast, 2018\n\n* [Why Reddit Is Losing Its Battle with Online Hate]( https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/08/reddit-hate-content-moderation/) – Mother Jones, 2019\n\n* [BBC calls out /r/The_donald for being a \"thriving hub for conspiracy theories,\" says Spez and admins are \"misguided\" and \"ill-equipped\" to tackle site issues]( https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43383766) – BBC, 2018\n\n\nFinally, just two short years ago, Steve Huffman went on the record saying that racism and slurs are perfectly fine to post on Reddit.\n\n* [Open racism and slurs are fine to post on Reddit, says CEO]( https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/12/racism-slurs-reddit-post-ceo-steve-huffman) – The Guardian, 2018\n\n\nSteve Huffman has made it clear that he does not care about protecting communities.  Steve Huffman does not care about black people.  Steve Huffman does not care about racism.\n\n\nSteve is a failure as a CEO and should resign.",

You _may_ be able to get individual subs to ban the behaviour, sometimes, maybe, good luck. As for sitewide? Fat fucking chance.\n\nAnd I've only been on the receiving end of basement dwelling trolls doing such. I cannot imagine what it would be like to get on the radar of one of these groups.\n\nThe only saving grace for Reddit is the level of community moderation available. It would be an absolute cesspool if it wasn't for that.",
