But like a giant boulder rolling down a mountain the truth eventually crushes the bullshit.\n\nSo, this is also a thing I've been thinking about a while, and we need to deal with it. They've taken the idea of a Gish Gallop from a debate and applied it to everything all the time. Let's figure out counter-strategies based on knowing this attack.",

Sartre's comment on fascists applies to these trolls just as well:\n\n> “Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.”",
