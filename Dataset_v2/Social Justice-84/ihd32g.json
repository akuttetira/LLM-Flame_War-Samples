Losing DMCA Safe Harbour is a potential result. That would bankrupt Reddit.\n\nSo Reddit -- in order to stay afloat _legally_, and avoid government regulators / lawsuits, remains \"agnostic\" of the content of subreddits.\n\nThey treat each report as an isolated incident, until and unless they have direct and incontrovertible proof directly from the moderators of a subreddit, that the subreddit violates -- by its nature or operation -- the Sitewide Rules and/or User Agreement ... they have to have a _case_ that will hold up in case they ever get sued by someone or investigated by some government regulator, and all their ducks in a row.",

But if you have those watchers in charge of the subreddits themselves, they'll never make the call to self ban their own hateful community. They'll only target each other, and then you risk being back to square one and Reddit needs to take a position it will judge upon, and defend.\n\nI know in my own case, a seriously unhinged stalker just kept swapping identities again and again and each time I reported it in to Reddit, I had to try and explain the backstory as to why I knew it was him all over again; I'm not sure that would even be possible now with the tiny report form Reddit allows you to fill in... The whole thing is frankly an unwholesome mess.\n\nBut good on the users here for at least trying to keep track of the hatred and continuing to flag it up.",
