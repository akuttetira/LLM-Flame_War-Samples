    "post_text ": "If you've ever visited /r/DarkHumorAndMemes you might have had an extremely hard time finding any evidence of \"humor\".   But in among the constant reposts and the same tired old recycled jokes you would have found many alt-right losers and incels who cowardly hide behind the pretense of \"humor\" in order to bully and harass marginalized groups.   \n\n\nIt was only a month ago when a mod of r/DarkHumorandMemes went mask off and called for a brigade to harass and bully the users  of  r/nonbinary.    \n\n* ARTICLE:   [Queer Subreddit Attacks Are Forcing Moderators To Demand Action](https://nowthisnews.com/news/queer-subreddit-attacks-are-forcing-moderators-to-demand-action)\n\n* r/LGBT POST:   [An open letter to Reddit about raids on LGBTQ+ Subs](https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/g76z5h/an_open_letter_to_reddit_about_raids_on_lgbtq_subs/)\n\n* r/AHS POST: [Posters on r/DarkHumorAndMemes brigades r/Nonbinary, which is against Reddit’s rules. r/nonbinary is restricted for the time being.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/g3yqf7/posters_on_rdarkhumorandmemes_brigades_rnonbinary/fnut7pf/)\n\n\n \n\nDespite the subreddit being suspended for brigading and harassment, as soon as the admins allowed DH&M to reopen their users immediately called for more harassment and more brigading.

                    "Reply_Text": "The fact that so many users believe disgusting Nazi propaganda is extremely troubling.   [[FULL DEBUNKING HERE]](https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/fwjskj/watch_reddit_lie_part_ii_how_rwatchredditdie_has/fqd6ko8/).\n\n\nHate groups  have a long history of creating hoaxes and conspiracy theories in order to accuse everyone that they disagree with of being pedophiles.   They also have a history of creating hoaxes to incite their users into taking matters into their own hands.   And these claims are no exception.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**The Claims:**\n\n1. r/againsthatesubreddits in a significant and official  capacity organized \"coordinated raids\" and \"brigaded\" hate subs.\n\n2. That AHS was responsible for trolls posting child exploitation material on toxic hate subs such as r/WatchRedditDie and r/coomer.\n\n3. They have then continually claimed that everyone who has ever used AHS is not only allegedly responsible for this, but we're also all pedophiles who commit the crime of distributing child exploitation material.\n\n4. WRD and other hate subs claimed that this occurred because hate subs aren't actually banned because they repeatedly break Reddit's TOS and harass other redditors with impunity but rather hate subs are instantly banned because hostile users post child exploitation material to \"false flag\" them.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n**1. All the \"evidence\" suggests this was the work of an anonymous troll who went out of their way to frame AHS**\n\n* The \"evidence\" does not suggest that there was any \"brigading\" (coordinated vote manipulation)  not to mention there  is no evidence of \"coordination\", just someone who made multiple alt accounts.\n\n* Anonymous trolls have been posting offensive content for the \"lulz\" since the invention of message boards on the internet.  There are and were subreddits dedicated to doing this. Pretty much all subs are targets for these trolls.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n**2. It turns out that no actual child exploitation material was ever posted on WRD or other hatesubs.**\n\n* WRD Mod:   [*\"… the content everyone is referring to as “child porn” here (at least as far as I’ve seen as a mod of WRD) isn’t pictures of child abuse.\"*](https://i.imgur.com/TXBxJIj.jpg)   //  [[ORIGINAL THREAD]](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeclineIntoCensorship/comments/ftl11x/reminder_that_ahs_is_still_posting_cp/fm9zsrv/) //  [[ARCHIVE]](https://archive.is/TBKg3)\n\n* If it was was child exploitation material like they claim, then WRD would go onto admitting  [[HERE]](https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchRedditDie/comments/fga1wg/stop_providing_links_to_removed_content_that_may/)  //  [[ARCHIVE]](https://archive.is/2qWcv)  that their users were and still are  committing serious criminal offensives - and that they had to instruct their users to not distribute it!\n\n* The fact that hate subs have openly shared extremely poorly censored version of these images suggests again suggests that they're either happy to keep committing the serious offenses they falsely accuse of AHS of, **OR** these images are not child exploitation material.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**3. There was never any evidence to support their assertion that there was any actual involvement from AHS.  Because there was never any actual involvement from AHS.**\n\n* The troll's attempts to associate themselves with AHS were so obviously deliberate that they are  comically clumsy.  They actually expect you to believe that before this user attempted to frame the hate subs that they would go out of their way to associate themselves with the people they claim were actually behind the attacks.   It is like they expect you to believe that a bank robber would pull off their mask and show their face and drivers license to the security guards before pulling out their gun and demanding that they hand over the cash.\n\n* But the conspiracy gets even dumber.   They expect you to believe that this troll would simultaneously post rule breaking content in sub in order to frame them and get that sub banned (which isn't even possible) **BUT**  at the same time the troll would  provide that sub with a signed confession which would prove that the hate sub was entirely innocent!\n\n* Additionally the same people pushing these accusations that AHS is supporting or associated with this, are the same people who manage to claim that all rule breaking posts and comments on their subs are actually 'false flags' especially the ones that become highly upvoted. Despite automod it is extremely possible for users with no affiliation and who are openly hostile to AHS to post benign comments in AHS, and then go post rule breaking content in other subs.\n\n* To suggest there is a causal connection which would suggest an actual involvement of AHS, on this basis, is laughable.\n\n* Their conspiracy of course makes no sense. But again, that is by design, it is designed to appeal mainly to the extremely radicalized and hysterical user base of hate subs.    It's so dumb that not even all hate sub users are fooled.\n\n*  WRD Mod: [*\"The kids in these pictures are not being abused in the pictures and I think it's a misnomer to suggest that they are \"child porn\" but they are certainly unwelcome.*    ***All of the evidence that AHS members are involved in these attacks is circumstantial at best, and would also be consistent with someone attempting to frame their community. \"***](https://i.imgur.com/jj7qcpa.jpg)   //  [[ORIGINAL THREAD]](https://www.reddit.com/user/FreeSpeechWarrior/comments/e74nyh/ask_me_anything/fm8ika5/?context=10000)  //  [[ARCHIVE]](https://archive.is/Mz4Ns)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**4. As expected doing something as stupid as sharing child exploitation material would not get a subreddit banned.**\n\n* To anyone with an iota of common sense the idea that a hostile user can post offensive NSFW / NSFL exploitation material to a sub and get it banned is utterly ridiculous. It simply would not get a subreddit banned. The only way a sub could get banned for this is if their mods knowingly and willingly did not remove it. The only people who are gullible enough to think that a sub could get banned for such a thing are users of hate subs who are desperate to find in conspiracy theories that absolves them of taking personal responsibility for their actions. It is those users of hate subs that this hoax is targeted at.\n\n* Many subs including r/AgainstHateSubreddits has to deal with trolls who attempt to post offensive NSFW / NSFL content.\n\n* If hate subs are getting banned because users are posting child exploitation on them, then they would be getting because it is their own users doing it and/or because their moderators were approving and or not removing it.\n\n* If this was true then hostile users could get hate subreddits banned with impunity.\n\n* And what a surprise it didn't get r/WatchRedditDie banned.",

If I were to tell you that half of our mods were legitimately gay and/or trans would you call them self-hating? Seeing as that's the case for the server, I believe you misunderstand our subreddit. I'm genuinely sorry for any emotional harm caused by those who break the rules on the subreddit but I assure you it isn't from the community as a whole.\nI genuinely don't understand where you're connecting pedophilia with AHS, that must be something I'm unaware of as I was simply trying to make a joke about how people see DHM. None of us are \"literal nazis\" because fascists get perma-banned, along with people who think \"haha n-word funny\" is a legitimate excuse.\n\n\nTLDR: I think we're at a misunderstanding.
