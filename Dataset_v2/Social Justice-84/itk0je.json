The idea that Jews were kidnapping Gentile children for sacrifice is something that dates back to at least the 19th century—and a beat for beat restatement of it is seen with the whole \"adrenochrome\" conspiracy. QAnon slightly tones down \"Jews\" in favour of \"Liberals\"—but most fascists believe that liberalism and socialism were created by Jews, so that's six of one, half a dozen of the other.",
