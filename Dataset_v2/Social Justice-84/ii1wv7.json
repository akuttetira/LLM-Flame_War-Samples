And - about what?\n\n---\n\nIf we're talking about the nature of hateful trolling that's posted to AHS, that's simple: Our words as moderators here are enough. If there was some real necessity such that someone _needed_ the content of a comment which a hateful troll left here - that's almost always captured in one of our log files or in the ban \"paperwork\" we create when we ban an account. If there's a _legal_ need, then a court could ask us and we'd comply (if they didn't just subpoena Reddit, Inc. for the text of the comments).\n\nWho are we persuading?\n\nIf we're persuading good faith users - they know already that this happens across Reddit. /r/redditsecurity's latest post discusses the scope and nature of the problem. Good faith moderators who've taken steps to shield their communities from hatred and harassment become the targets of co-ordinated efforts to harass.\n\nPersuade bad faith users? They know - and they want it spread as much as possible. They glory in undelete tools and bots - any way that allows them to flount and circumvent the rules of Reddit and a subreddit, and the technological access controls of the site and a subreddit. **They're not happy unless they're afforded the ability to exercise illicit power over someone else who cannot (easily) stop them and who is harmed by the exercise of that power.**\n\nPersuade admins? They have access to all content on the site, already. They have the ultimate \"receipts\".\n\nPersuade journalists? If it became necessary to do so, we could add a journalist or researcher to our moderator team, and they could read the material for themselves -- we could also approve specific comments temporarily - which makes them publicly readable. That -- sourcing material to a journalist -- is something we've brainstormed.\n\nWe also think it's highly unlikely a journalist would find any utility in 99% of the removed comments here, which are ultimately just vast repetitions of slight variations on themes of trite thought-terminating cliches and statements of hatred -\n\nBut, there might be some noteworthy exceptions, so we try to plan for those contingencies.\n\n----\n\nRemoveddit, reveddit, undeletebot, etc - are not your friends. They are third-party wrappers of PushShift.\n\nPushShift is owned and operated by a reputable, accredited, upstanding academic researcher, who is not using it to harm people and who takes steps to comply with the Reddit User Agreement and the Reddit API User Agreement. He's _trustworthy_.\n\nYou have no such assurances for third-party wrappers of pushshift, (e.g. reveddit), and there's copious amounts of evidence that these systems are run by untrustworthy people - who might be compiling information about visitors, might be looking for usage patterns to help de-anonymify Reddit users, and might feel the desire to change specific data being reported back to the users of their sites.\n\n----\n\nPushShift archives a lot of Reddit activity that goes public elsewhere on the site, and serves, for most intents and purposes, as close-enough-to-receipts for that activity.",
