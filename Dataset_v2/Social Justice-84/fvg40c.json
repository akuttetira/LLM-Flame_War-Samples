I don't think anyone should be praising China's handling of the virus considering they covered up the existence for a while, arrested anyone trying to spread information about it, and have blatantly lied about the case count and death count, and then only contained it by forcibly barricading people into their own homes, which cause many people to starve to death.\n\nObviously the racist garbage coming out of these subs is unwarranted, but let's not start sucking the Chinese government's dick  over this just so we can play the foil.",

Stating facts is now praise. Where you clawed that one from out the crack of your ass i do not know.\n\nAgain.\n\nTHEY WERE on the front lines. Had no chance to prepare for this.

Not sucking dick. Facts.\n\nOh and don't forget. Many of the things you're fake upset with china about our government did and is doing as we speak. With their being a massive chance they will get worse over time.\n\nI mean...did you forget that america and the uk also let people starve to death way before covid-19?

It is not binary, you don't have to praise the Chinese government at all. Why are you doing it? I feel like a lot of people are starting to reflexively defend the CCP just so they can take an opposite stand to the \"warmongering racist shits.\"\n\nRepublicans are awful, but the Chinese government is also awful, and much more so. Stop praising the Chinese government! They are committing genocide, oppress their own people and police their thoughts, and recently actively covered up a deadly pandemic that is now plaguing the entire planet, and lied to everyone about how bad it was. Is that really a good response? Jesus.",

Never said Trump isn't an idiot who caused this to get totally out of hand in the US. Go look through my post history, you'll find me arguing with people about why it's racist to call it \"The Chinese Virus\" and why Trump is calling it that to shift blame from himself to China.\n\nThat being said, I'm also not going to start praising the Chinese government and pretending that they didn't literally arrest doctors and citizens that tried spreading information on the virus which directly led to the rest of the world being unprepared for the seriousness of this.\n\nTell me, how many deaths are there actually in China from this virus? Because it sure as shit isn't 3,000. Which means the Chinese government is lying.\n\nYour usage of whataboutism and accusations of racism to defend a Chinese government that is literally genociding Uighur Muslims this very moment is ridiculous.
