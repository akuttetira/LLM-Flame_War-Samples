I'm a 73- old French, nearly Trump's age, and *never* in my life I had to suffer the least damage that came specifically from gay/trans people because of their being LGBT+.\n\nWhen our French government decided to allow gay marriage, I thought: \"Gay marriage? Weird idea, as marriage has become a hazardous affair for everybody, but, well, if gays ask for it and this can make some of them happier, why not?\". But even here, in France, a country where people are able to elect a socialist president from time to time, there were people to protest against a liberty that didn't harm them in the slightest. Those people were indeed far-right activists taking advantage of any opportunity to create disorder.\n\nThe greatest problem with the omnipresence of far-right propaganda is their obstinate search of new scapegoats and new divisions in order to create the chaos that would help them seize power. I hope that the majority of people will eventually get tired of the poisonous atmosphere of hatred they are tirelessly fostering.",

There was a ton of outright bigotry on that sub, but think it might be helpful to more accurately portray some of their thoughts, especially since we can't visit the sub anymore to see it first hand.\n\nYou don't need to argue with **me**, but go ahead and pick these apart or elaborate.\n\nMy understanding is that some gay men and lesbian women feel that the growing acceptance of trans people is becoming an over-acceptance. One that they feel is eroding their own identities.\n\nFor example, IIRC LGBdroptheT would sometimes post about how the trans community was effectively relabeling homosexuality as being a \"genital fetish.\" They felt that just because they were attracted exclusively to a cisgender \"man\" or \"woman,\" that makes them homosexual, and is *not* a genital fetish. To them, calling it a genital fetish is erasure of their sexuality in favor of trans acceptance.\n\nAnother argument I think I have a grasp on is the gay-bar one, and it goes hand in hand with the above.\n\nAccording to them: Gay bars were commonly started as a way for gay men to meet other gay men -you go to meet cisgender men with dicks to date or hook-up with. They felt that recently, trans, NB trans people, and more women have been coming to gay bars and 'muddying the waters.' In that case, they feel it's getting in the way of their lifestyle and makes finding someone they're sexually interested in more difficult.\n\nI can maybe see where they're coming from with these arguments, but I don't understand what reasonable conclusion they could result in that isn't obviously discriminatory. I guess that's why it turns into express hatred of trans people.",

I’ll link Bardfinn’s comment on the sub’s demographic: [(x)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/hqdc60/rlgbdropthet_transphobic_subreddit_got_banned/fxxedft/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\n>For example, IIRC LGBdroptheT would sometimes post about how the trans community was effectively relabeling homosexuality as being a \"genital fetish.\" They felt that just because they were attracted exclusively to a cisgender \"man\" or \"woman,\" that makes them homosexual, and is not a genital fetish. To them, calling it a genital fetish is erasure of their sexuality in favor of trans acceptance.\n\nThis one reeks of bad faith arguments and cherry-picking on their part, and/or falling for the same troll twitter accounts that pretend to be real LGBT people supporting “pedosexual” being added to the acronym. (Which is the oldest slippery-slope trick in the book regarding cis gay people, just adopted to apply to trans people.) “Having a genital preference = having a fetish” is not at all a widely-held serious viewpoint amongst trans people. When it *is* expressed in seemingly good faith, I’ve always seen other trans people engaging in debate & criticism of this idea (myself included). However, most of the time I’ve seen it expressed, it tends to be a satirical clapback at TERs reducing everyone to their genitals in a way that is graphic to the point of sounding like fetish porn (hence the sub r/TERFisafetish), as well as the creepy as fuck behavior of some TER cis women when talking about or approaching trans men. (Some of their comments about “‘trans ideology’ stealing and mutilating our ‘lesbians’” goes beyond general hatefulness and turns into heavy tones of “noo don’t cut ur tiddies off aha ur so sexy” and it makes me feel *extremely* uncomfortable. Note: I do NOT mean to feed into the “predatory lesbian” stereotype. That’s extremely harmful, and of course lesbian TERs do not represent the vast majority of lesbians. Also, some of these comments come from TER straight women. It’s not necessarily about attraction, it’s about power.)\n\n>According to them: Gay bars were commonly started as a way for gay men to meet other gay men -you go to meet cisgender men with dicks to date or hook-up with. They felt that recently, trans, NB trans people, and more women have been coming to gay bars and 'muddying the waters.' In that case, they feel it's getting in the way of their lifestyle and makes finding someone they're sexually interested in more difficult.\n\nI can come back with sources later, but most of this isn’t true at all, and I suspect comes down to confirmation bias & wanting to have something/someone to blame for not being able to find a partner.\n\nThere’s this false historically revisionist narrative that trans people are a new demographic crowding out cis gay people, but that doesn’t hold up to scrutiny when looking at the history of the gay community at all, particularly during the hysteria of straight, cis people during the AIDS crisis. Nuances of identity didn’t to matter to the status quo—all the “sexual degenerates” (including the kink community of the era, who were often LGBT themselves & a major part of gay rights advocacy—see leather gays) were lumped together by politicians and the general public. Gay bars have historically been a safe place for *all* the so-called “degenerates” to be themselves and meet to socialize/date/hookup. Gay bathhouses, in contrast, were explicitly a place for cis gay men to meet other cis gay men—*to my knowledge*. Don’t take my word as gospel; it’s been a while since I’ve read up on bathhouses.\n\nCis lesbian and bi women have been at gay bars for years, and although there’s still debate about this, the first person to throw a brick at Stonewall was most likely a cis butch lesbian named Stormé DeLarverie rather than Marsha P. Linehan, although obviously both played crucial roles in the gay liberation movement, regardless of the details of what happened at Stonewall.\n\nThere was a major overlap between the self-identification *and* intracommunity perception of trans women (“tr#nss#xuals”) vs. drag queens/cross-dressers(“transv#st#tes”) prior to & at the time of the AIDS crisis, so although the way that trans women are regarded now may be different, they have absolutely been a part of gay bars and the gay rights movement at large, hand in hand with gender-nonconforming cis bisexual & gay men.\n\nTrans men have also been around, but it’s not as widely documented for numerous reasons that I’ve run out of time to elaborate on...for a brief example: the misgendering of prominent trans male historical figures.\n\nAlright, gotta run. Hope this helps some. I’d encourage everyone to learn more about the history of the LGBT community.",

I mean, I get they don't care that supporting trans is the human thing to do here, but at least act smart and do it for self-preservation.",

He was just there to join in with his peers, aka TERFs because they had aligned themselves with his beliefs and his hatred.\n\nTLDR It was a hate sub masquerading as an LGBT sub. Maybe it started off as something else (although I doubt it) but if mods of a sub can’t keep hate out of their sub then they deserve to get the ban hammer as per Reddit’s rules about minority hate.",
