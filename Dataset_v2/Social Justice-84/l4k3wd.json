    "post_text ": "thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/jovz0o/reminder\\_that\\_men\\_are\\_men\\_and\\_gay\\_men\\_can\\_be/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/jovz0o/reminder_that_men_are_men_and_gay_men_can_be/)\n\nFrom my observation, FDS is heavy on radical feminism especially the extremely bigoted strain (think julie bindle, sheila jeffreys, germaine greer etc), which is not suprising since it shares the same userbase with r/gc and r/pinkpillfeminism.\n\nto understand radfem homophobia, radfems like sheila jeffreys and marilyn fyre write books about how the male culture is misogynistic and homoerotic. they go further and claim that misogynistic men exist because they are closeted homosexuals and turn their internalized homophobia into hatred for women (which is a popular trope parroted among FDS members including the mods) , and that gay men are inherently misogynistic because women have no use for them. in short radfem theories for homosexuality can be summarized into\n\n1. men are gay because they are misogynists\n2. men are misogynists because they are gay\n\nin fact, radfems have a tendency to breakdown and downplay LGBT issues and explain away their unique struggles in terms of misogyny. for example, they believe that \"trans ideology\" is misogynistic because they think that\n\n1. trans women exist because of misogyny\n2. trans men exist because of internalized misogyny\n\nthat's why LGBTphobia, especially transphobia, homophobia and biphobia, is a common theme in r/FDS .\n\nnow look at the comments\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Gay men are some of the strongest proponents of disgusting misogyny, never forget\n\nliterally sheila jeffrey's theory of gay misogynists\n\n>I've said this too on subs that no longer exist. Gay men are not allies. They don't need you for sex so, at best, they are making you their emotional wash rag or living out their femme fantasies through you by controlling you (approving your hair, makeup, dress, etc.). At worst, they're using you to scout talent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>This 100%. I am afraid of coming across as homophobic when I say this irl, but I think this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The truth is never \"phobic\". That's just male gaslighting and manipulation. If I'm so homophobic, how come so many lesbians are my girls? 😂\n\nthere is a rising propaganda in radfem and conservative publications to frame surrogacy as one of \"LGBT rights\", when in actuality the overwhelming majority of customers for surrogacy are straight women.\n\n>Yes. Except the rich ones are very eager to use us as surrogates (broodmares).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>And then they immediately hire a woman nanny to take care of their baby, because they don't want to take care of the kid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Yep. They find themselves a nanny.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The truth is that if men didn't want us for sex they would have murdered us all by now. Without pretending to like us so they can get laid, men just show their true colors immediately. Gay men have actively popularized calling women breeders and bitches as if being gay gives them a pass to use female spaces and slurs.\n\ntransphobia here for good measure\n\n>Ironically Gay men( and Transwomen) mimic women. If he hates us I hope he doesn't try to compete with us women in looks, fashion, makeup and others.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Meh, they mimic female stereotypes of women that were constructed by men. They couldn't survive our reality for even a week.\n\nagain, radfem homophobia\n\n>Some of the worst misogynists I’ve ever known were gay men. They don’t want to fuck us, so they have no incentive to pretend to be nice.\n\npretty sure homophobic women outnumber gay misogynists, but go off.\n\n>What is something straight men can agree with gay men on?  \n>  \n>(☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞ Denigrating Women ☜(ﾟヮﾟ☜)\n\nsome sexual economics in r/FDS . so this field is not exclusive to incels. it's all about the supply and demand, because discussing about women like they are a commodity is not denigrating at all /s.\n\n>His is not a surprising position, being that women and gay men are both competing for men. We are a threat to the available resources. The men he desires may very well go home with said “ugly bitch” due to repressed homosexuality, bisexuality, or heterosexuality if he is attracted to a straight man.\n\nof course, some homophobic slurs for good measure\n\n>All that hatred no reason. Fruit loops is lucky that someone finds him physically attractive because I know his personality is AWFUL\n\n^(AHS disclaimer: This post is a post in an anti-hatred activism subreddit which actively enforces in good faith all Reddit Sitewide Rules, including the rule against targeted harassment and the rule against promoting hatred based on identity or vulnerability, and serves the legitimate purpose of criticism of, and opposition to, hate speech platformed and promoted elsewhere on Reddit.

Any LGBTQ+ person who has spent enough time among cis gay men will be able to tell you that they can be highly prejudiced against women and especially women who do not fit western beauty standards.",
