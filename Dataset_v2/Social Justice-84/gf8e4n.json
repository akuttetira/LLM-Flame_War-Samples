He'd go to bars with us but never approach women because he was terrified they'd reject him or think he was being creepy and lacked the ability to talk to a woman as a potential sexual partner, rather than as just a person.\n\nAnyway, he's 39 now and still a virgin and while it eats him up inside - especially being slightly overweight with middle age spread - he's resigned himself to never having what others \"get so easily\" in his words. We mentioned sex workers to him but he doesn't want to go that route because of the illegality of it, plus not wanting to contribute to potential sex trafficking.\n\nIt's a shame because there are genuine incels out there who really need the help but they get thrown in with this pedo-wannabes who just want to chain women up and use them as sex slaves to carry out some hateful revenge fantasy.",
