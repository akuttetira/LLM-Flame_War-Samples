    "post_text ": "We did indeed support the final decision by the admins.  However, just like 99% of reddit, we chose not to associate with \"the movement\" as a whole for several reasons:\n\n- There were plenty of anti-LGBT & other bigoted communities on that list from the early hours that we want no association with.  This is not in any way an indictment of the rest of the subs that joined in with them, but for obvious reasons our users hold us to a different standard.\n\n- The article that started all this: The one removed from UKPolitcs.  We will not link or name the article because we don't know where the admins are on blacklisting it & also because of the crux of this point: The article that started all of this was ***extremely*** transphobic.  It's title contained the phrase **\"the danger of transgender politics\"**, it obviously did a lot of fearmongering about \"transgender politics\", it drew links between transgenderism & pedophelia, & made a big show of deliberately misgendering her.  Given the transphobic beginnings we did not want to publicly associate with the movement.\n\n- Related to the above point: We felt the people who were “leading” “the movement” were not doing enough to curb the transphobia & homophobia that was unleashed within the movement, that is to say, ***absolutely fucking nothing***.  They could have used their soapbox & new found clout to make a statement to the effect of “hey guys, not all trans people are degenerate perverts,” (which was the trope-du-jour of the “red-pilling” interlopers we exist to frustrate), or even a measly “transphobia is not good.”  They chose to stay silent on the issue & basically throw the LGBT community under the bus with the admin **& now several LGBT subs are private because of the influx of abuse.** The whole thing lacked leadership of any kind, something this community finds rather important.\n\n- Us going private would, quite frankly, be doing the admins a favor, whatever the context. \n\n- See also: [Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/wiki/faq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) for a better understanding of our community philosophies.\n\nSo, that’s why we didn’t join the blackout. The mod team was on board with the ***intended*** outcome of the movement, but again, ***just like 99% of the rest of reddit***, we opted not to be part of the movement itself.",

I took classes in archery.” <-- they don't give archery ribbons in the real world. LMFAO thanks for the share.\n\nFor Huffman, it’s been a concern for years. “Ever since I saw the movie ‘Deep Impact\" does he not understand that if something like that actually happened, it would wipe out most life on the planet? anything left would not be happy campers. No wonder reddit is so fucked up, fantasists are running the show.\n\nHuffman: \"I will probably be in charge, or at least not a slave, when push comes to shove.” sorry but this just keeps getting more and more hysterical. he wants to create a post-apocalyptic version of reddit LOL!!\n\nI hope these poor saps are doing more than just getting eye surgery. tl;dr reddit is run by an oligarch who refuses to take any responsibility for the mess he helped create. smdh\n\nOne of them says, “If we had a more equal distribution of income, and much more money and energy going into public school systems, parks and recreation, the arts, and health care, it could take an awful lot of sting out of society. We’ve largely dismantled those things.” <-- it's a vicious cycle, they say its unfair they're so rich, yet they tell the politicians they put into office that unless they transfer even more wealth, they'll be voted out of office.\n\nJohnson asked. “What does that really tell us about our system?” He added, “It’s a very odd thing. You’re basically seeing that the people who’ve been the best at reading the tea leaves—the ones with the most resources, because that’s how they made their money—are now the ones most preparing to pull the rip cord and jump out of the plane.” <-- these people actually smoke their own supply and believe that they made it on their own. what a joke.\n\nOn Huffman: \"He has witnessed how social media can magnify public fear. \" I would actually say that he has stood by while his website enabled public fear to be magnified.\n\ngood read.",

Not a pedophile but defended her father who was & married someone who wrote pedophilic erotic fiction... Reddit shouldn’t have hired her, almost everyone agrees there, I think.\n\nSo some power mods decide to ~~first approach the admins calmly and ask for her resignation~~ lol jk, they decided to chase clout & organize a rather anemic blackout while whipping up a Reddit lynch mob who proceeded to do the very predictably reddit response of filling up the front page of nearly every non-shuttered community with unflattering pictures of said admin & attacking the entire trans community while taking the stance that anyone who wasn’t a willful participant in said lynch mob was a pedophile sympathizer & then claimed “we did it!” once the admins made the only decision any reasonable person would expect.",

Counterintuitively, they all actually draw their power *from* their **impotence**.  Now most people can't do it at all, and neither can they, normally.  However, they are able to hypnotize themselves via several hours of either reactionary YouTube, Fox News or even AM radio in a pinch, and by doing so they enter a trancelike state where normal cortical function ceases and the brain is able to focus all of it's energy on convincing themselves that their profundity of **impotence** is magically someone else's fault.  This allows them to channel that **impotence** through their MTN DEW conduit straight into their Dorito gland and generate immense amounts of **impotent rage**.\n\nKnowing this, the trick is to simply remind them that their **impotence** actually belongs to them, that they are the thing that is always standing in their way and **nothing** they do **will** ever **matter**, and it disrupts this psychic channeling.  Usually they’ll just slink off to their Nazi-nest or Loli-den where they soothe themselves through a ritual of masturbation & yelling at minorities on xbox-live.  Then they are able to re-hypnotize themselves.  The whole process takes anywhere from 6-18 hours, depending on their level of lack of fitness, which is more than enough time for them to get mad about something else that either isn’t real or doesn't affect them, so you usually won’t hear from them again for a day or two, if at all.",
