If you're haggling over how many times it's acceptable to shoot someone you've already given up a downright absurd amount of ground.\n\nThe number of bullets fired should either be zero (lethal force isn't warranted) or as many as is necessary to kill someone (lethal force is warranted). The threshold to cross from the first scenario to the second is so far from where it should be it's criminal. We need to move that threshold, not argue over the number of bullets.",

It engenders this weird casual idea that shooting someone isn't gonna kill them if you weren't *trying* to.\n\nThere are much more important distinctions between our police force and others, like that many of them simply don't have officers carrying guns everywhere, or never carrying until a situation requires it. I don't think \"we should shoot the unarmed black man one time instead of seven\" should be the actual focus of concern here.\n\nEDIT: Granted, using that idea has clearly not kept the US police from treating guns incredibly casually, so take from that what you will",

If you're *truly* in a self-defense situation, you can use as many bullets as you need. If that means the entire magazine, that's what you gotta do. Everybody reacts to bullets differently, especially with differing body masses or different chemicals. Some people can eat bullets and still keep charging. If they have a knife you'd better be prepared to pull that trigger until they drop. And at the point where you're using lethal force, \"extra\" lethal force isn't really a thing. If you're worried about killing someone \"too much\", then you probably didn't need to kill them at all, meaning this isn't self-defense.\n\nAgain, this only applies if you're *actually* defending your life (and this is what *should* apply to police officers). Right now they can just say \"I feared for my life\" with a smirk and a wink and the courts say \"well ok then and thank you for your service\".",

You use as many bullets as needed to end a threat to your life, but you don't go into that thinking \"I'm just going to shoot to disable, not to kill\". If you're pulling the trigger you'd better be ready to have a life on your hands because in an uncontrolled firefight -type situation there's no reliable way to just shoot to maim or disable. If you're shooting at someone in such a situation you are trying to kill them, and training any law enforcement to think any differently just seems like a quick way to raise casualty rates on all sides.",
