Its brilliant as a meme. They also did \"Its OK to be white\" These one liners cause chaos with the far left intersectionalists. **They don't know how to respond.**\n\n(emphasis mine)\n\nThis kind of thinking must be why they've turned politics into such a team sport.  Apparently they think you can either criticize a group or support a group, but not both, and surely not for different policies or topics I guess.",
