The real reason we are anti-semitic is because the Jewish religion is supremacist. They believe that it's their destiny to rule the world and turn the rest of us into slaves. They believe this is the moral thing to do because their religion teaches that non-Jews have aninal souls and we can only elevate ourselves through obedience.\n\nClearly, my copy of the Jewish Handbook for World Domination must still be in the mail or something.",

                    "Reply_Text": "Wait, which religion fought wars to uproot all peoples inhabiting a piece of land in a bid for a religious icon? Was it the same religion that also enslaved and slaughtered their way through the Americas in the name of “purifying” and “enlightening?” It really feels like it’s the same religion that caused bloody conflict in Western Europe when a schism happened at the suggestion that maybe war crimes are bad and religion shouldn’t be pay-to-win. Wasn’t it also the same religion that currently has weaseled its way into the structure and laws of the US at a base level, and invites vitriol at the mention of changing it? Which religion has had 100% representation in the US Presidents, and has acted nuts when someone other than them runs against them? Which religion prophesies eternal damnation and pain specifically to ALL others (regardless of moral standing or opportunity to join), and to basically all minorities who seek rights for themselves? Which religion was used to justify the murder of over 6 million members of another religion?\n\nNot Jews, not Muslims, and not any of the other religions they like to shit on. If we’re talking about religions that are supremacist, cruel, violent, and devoted to the subjugation and oppression of anyone “other,” we’re talking about Christians. So many have completely abandoned their core tenant of “hey Jesus said not to be an asshole,” instead fighting to oppress and intervene in lives.\n\nFun fact, this person’s shitty mask-off admission of anti-semitism makes no sense until you replace Judaism with Christianity as the “supremacist” religion. I’ve got some substantial jewish ancestry, and I’m still waiting for my invite to whatever club this is. Nobody jewish has ever cone up to me telling me i’m damned and am going to hell if i don’t join. Nobody jewish has ever treated me differently for not practicing or following THEIR religion. I get that for every demographic there are exceptions, but it is absolutely the norm for christians in the US and other countries to be supremacist and hateful.",
