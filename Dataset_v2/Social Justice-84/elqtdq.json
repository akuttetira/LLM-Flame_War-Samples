So no, Bernie supporters did not elect Trump.\n\nThe constant scorn from moderate Democrats towards those left of Reagan since 2016 will likely sway a larger portion of further left voters to not vote or to vote for a third party. The DNCs decision that middle of the road politics is the way to go will be the death of the party.\n\nLet’s remember the DNC before the Clintons took the reigns, back when it was a big tent party and there wasn’t this insane derision. It’s quaint looking back now. Sad that the moderates haven’t learned a single lesson in two decades.",
