You may very well be asking these questions in good faith, but the *way* you are asking the questions are problematic. Nobody is telling you that you are obligated to have sex with someone with a penis, but when you say \"I am a straight guy, I like the biological genitals of a woman\" when what you mean is \"I like vaginas\" you are cutting trans women out of your definition of \"woman.\"\n\nDrawing an analogue of your refusal to have sex with trans women because of the penis to your refusal to date gay men because of their penis is again equating trans women with men. A less problematic equivalent you could draw is one about how it would not be homophobic for you to refuse to have sex with *trans* men, but then I wonder if you *would* be willing to have sex with a trans man, since as stated your primary concern when choosing sex partners is whether they have a vagina.\n\nYou are never under any obligation to have sex with another person, ever, for any reason, including that you dislike the other person's genitals. That doesn't preclude from discussion the fact that you *may* have some underlying transphobia and homophobia that makes you overly revolted by the thought of touching another person's penis. It may just be that you are legitimately not interested in penises; only you can say for sure, but since WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY you have to do a lot of self examination to be able to tell the difference.\n\nWould you date a trans woman who has had genital reassignment surgeries? Do you factor this into whatever version of \"I don't date trans women\" you use? Or in your mind is trans woman equivalent to penis-haver and cis woman is equivalent to vagina-haver? Honest questions you should ask yourself.\n\nYou may be an ally but that doesn't make you perfect. You are being informed right now that your allyship in this conversation is *imperfect* and needs work. If your heart is in the right place, change your language to more accurately reflect your heart.",

What you said implied that you don’t think women with penises are actually women, which is of course transphobic.\n\nAlso you say that you’re a straight guy, and *thats* why you like the “biological genitals” of women. This too is transphobic, because it implies 1. that a straight man would never have sex with a woman who has a penis, which is very untrue, 2. that penises cannot be the biological genitals of a woman, which is again obviously untrue, 3. that vaginas cannot be the biological genitals of a man, which is also untrue and like the above statements is also transphobic.",

If someone isn't attracted to dick, doesn't want to play with a dick, then that's a valid preference. The opposite is equally valid, someone who doesn't want to be involved with a vagina is fine to have that preference. If someone refused to date someone solely on that basis, personally I think that's a dumb reason if everything else is great. But, that's also entirely their choice and I don't think that's necessarily discriminatory or transphobic in and of itself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut that's as far as I'll give someone a pass on that. If bottom surgery has taken place, then not even that argument stands. Someone refusing to date a transgender person in that circumstance definitely *is* transphobic. Not even the argument about \"but I want kids someday!\" stands there, because adoption is a thing.",

Whenever I put myself into the sort of hypothetical situation we're discussing, I've always done it in the context of the first few dates; by the time things got to the bedroom, I'd certainly hope a number of conversations had occurred first.\n\nPersonally, it's a detail I would put on the same level as having kids. When I was in the dating pool, I was usually pretty reluctant to date someone who had kids from a previous relationship.\n\nThese are things that kinda need to be disclosed early on, mainly to save people from wasting each other's time.",

Don't fuck them. If you expected one set of genitals and didn't like what you found then it's your own fault for not asking beforehand. If you don't do that then it's obviously not important enough to claim to be harmed or defrauded about. It's no one else's business to make sure you get to go through life never being surprised by anything",

However, no one owes you physical intimacy. You can respect transgender people while still being unwilling to engage in sexual activity with them.\n\n\nHow is it any different than just saying no to someone who you are not attracted to that is cis? Trying to guilt trip someone into having sex with you is wrong no matter how you identify.\n\n\nIt would certainly be transphobic to not maintain an existing friendship with someone after finding out they are transgender, however.",

I just don't get it.\n\nI was born in the 70s, and it's not like I knew many - or any? - trans people when I was growing up, but I was certainly aware it was a thing.  I wouldn't say it was accepted, but there was definitely not this kind of vitriolic hate focused on trans people like there is now.  I remember an episode of The Jeffersons that was about it, and there the joke was about how George Jefferson was having a bit of a hard time accepting that an old friend of his was trans.\n\nIn a lot of ways, society has made lots of progress since then, but in this way, I don't think so.  It's really scary.  Trans people didn't have it easy before, but this shit is just crazy.",

They lost on interracial marriage, then (eventually) they lost on denying equal rights to gays, and everyone saw that nothing bad happened to the world, so now they're just trying to deny equal rights to trans individuals?\n\nI guess that is the simple answer, but I think something else is also going on - the way hatred has just come to the fore lately, as opposed to normal ol' bigotry and discrimination.\n\nI don't know... it's just sad.  When are people going to decide that being on the wrong side of history is probably not a good idea for them?",

They get everyone on board, then when that current \"problem\" is taken care of, move on to the next, and whittle it down bit by bit. The rabid ones have no chill and want to get to the end then and now, but the smarter ones- who know all of this is just a means to an end to place themselves in the ring-leader position- play it slow and methodical.\n\nThe hapless goons don't care to know history. Learning's hard, and the truth is hard pill to swallow. Better to delude themselves into being Gods and Emperors born to world mastery than to accept that they're losers dealt a bad hand who chose to be monsters. The leaders know history, and know enough that if you get enough idiots on your side, and you hold the reigns, what happens next doesn't matter. They want to be kings, and have their legacy engraved in stone, and once they get that they're set. They'd destroy the world so long as they can rule the ashes.",
