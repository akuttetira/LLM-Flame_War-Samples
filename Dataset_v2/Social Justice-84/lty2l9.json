    "Post_Title": "/r/NoNewNormal is a misinformation sub entirely dedicated to spread fake information about the pandemic",
    "post_text ": "I know this isn't hate, but I hope this post is allowed given that COVID denialism is leading to deaths and there's no big subreddit to denounce this kind of stuff. I'm flairing it as \"violent political movement\" because it is a political movement and I consider it violent as it literally kills people.\n\n---\n\nNNN, as I'll be calling it, is a sub that is, in theory, devoted to \"talk about concerns\" and \"what can be done to resist\" the \"new normal\", that is, anything done to stop the COVID pandemic. \"Resisting\" it literally kills people. It also harbors every kind of fake information, disinformation, bad science and denialism around COVID that exists, from \"this is all fake, nobody dies from it\" to \"there's literally nothing we can do, so let's do nothing\". \n\nOnce again, Reddit acts as a forum for insane views with real-world consequences, in this case leading to preventable deaths from a pandemic.     \nEven though it has recently added \"Misinformation\" to its list of reports - defined as \"Spreading false information such as content that undermines civic processes or provides dangerous health misinformation.\" - NNN is allowed to exist actively spreading that misinformation and even brigading other subs. Right now it has 41,965 subscribers and 1,134 users reading it.\n\n[This](https://web.archive.org/web/20210227212841/https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/ltr80n/how_now_lol/)  is the kind of content normally posted there: misinformation. Comments include bullshit like \"the virus is seasonal\" and \"this is suspicious, there's probably a conspiracy behind it\".\n\nThey also love to attack anyone who is taking precautions or denouncing those who don't. For example, in [this post](https://web.archive.org/web/20210227213225/https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/lto36a/weird_kid_stands_in_the_corner_and_takes_photo_of/) - that has lead to a massive brigading on the original post - they make fun of a underage user worried that their school is ignoring safety measures. The comments are about how anyone who wants people not to die from COVID is an authoritarian or how the user who posted the photo just wants to fit with the \"doomers\" online.\n\nConspiracy theories about COVID are, of course, [extremely common](https://web.archive.org/web/20210227213518/https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/ltrte6/big_pharma_and_corporations_during_covid_times/). They're not very far from using triple brackets. \n\n[They even take stuff directly from /pol/](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/ltpcjo/source_pol/) - sorry for the lack of archiving on this one, the Internet Archive is just refusing to archive it.\n\n\n---\n\n\nAnd that's just what I found by looking at its current first page. Their content is always like that, and sometimes worse.      \nSo to reinforce the main point: given that Reddit already considers misinformation about COVID a breach of its rules, WHY IS THIS ALLOWED TO EXIST?",
