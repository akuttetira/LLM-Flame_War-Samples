That type of dishonest methodology keeps vast swaths of the right wing hate machine alive, else it would wither on the vine like conspiracists.\n\nE: while i am sympathetic with the end of your edit, it has to be said that trump is merely a symptom of americas ills, and removing him from office is the beginning of the process, not the end. We must dismantle violent racist rhetoric and the reactionary conservative outlets that spew it in order to divide us for their own gain.\n\nThat last bit will require uncovering the secretive ways these groups are being funded by entities hostile to the american way of life, and to our perpetual goal of a more perfect union. There is going to be a reckoning, and a lot of hard truths will have to come to light. In the timeless words of our previous first lady, be better.",
