    "post_text ": "\n\nFull post archive - https://archive.is/0hhHr  \n\nComment 1:\n\n> [Pakistan just pretends, they have lost their authority and legitimacy to speak for anything, and btw India should learn Xinjiang treatment from China, anyway India is both ways defamed without committing anything. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ](https://archive.is/g30mM)\n\n(By, Xinjiang treatment, they mean they want Muslims of India to be put in Camps)\n\nComment 2:\n\n> [Slap one M and all hell breaks loose K!ll and r@pe thousands of H but nothing happens \"Secular\" India](https://archive.is/9A71c)   \n\n(By M, he means Muslims & by H, he means Hindus.)    \n\nComment 3:   \n\n> [Yes it's too sad. It wont be surprising if hindus become minority in india in next 100 years. Those namazis only aim in life is to multiply and grow their religion size](https://archive.is/xS4lv)   \n\n\n\nThis conspiracy theory is rampant on their subreddit. It is an outright lie and a proven false conspiracy theory. (it's debunked [here](https://www.thequint.com/voices/opinion/hindu-muslim-population-growth-figures-population-explosion-legislation-npr-facts-myths) and several other articles) \n\nThey say this all the time to justify a Muslim genocide that they want to do in order to “protect” or “save” Hindus. \n\n\nSimilar conspiracy theory comment:\n\n> [Not Hindu but better than what we have right now, which is heading to a disaster and a Genocide in 2 decades or more. This Genocide will happen in our life time as well.](https://archive.is/y7lLs)\n\n\n\nComment 4:\n\n\n> [See bhratas they are not all like that. There are extremists and moderates, an extremist MusIim wants to cut your head off but a moderate MusIim doesn't, they want the extremist to cut your head off](https://archive.is/wip/uS7XS)\n\n\n\n\nComment 5:\n\n> [Akhand Bharat(India) minus muslim population. That’s the dream](https://archive.is/tVOa5)\n\n\n\n\nComment 6:\n\n> [They(Muslims) are just minority in percentage, but their numbers are huge enough to cause major civil war. That's why India needs to eliminate them before they rise up](https://archive.is/X7XQR)   \n\n\nBonus: [Casteist, LGBTphobic and misogyny meme](https://archive.is/acz9U)",
