Basically it’s invoking his right to go to war against his own people.\n\nAfaik Trump hasn’t actually done this, but spreading rumors that he has are absurdly irresponsible in this present climate.",

Of course they claim it was antifa even though antifa has absolutely no reason to protest Biden being sworn in. If a huge crowd gathers the morning of the inauguration and Trump actually uses the last of his power to use the Insurrection Act and take down the crowd, it would be the most beautiful example ever of r/leopardsatemyface.\n\nIt's like that story from The Darwin Awards where two guys snuck into a trailer to kill the owner and ended up in a knife-fight with each other in the confusion. One of them died and the other got badly injured and sent to the hospital.",

Nazis burn the parliament, nazis blame the communists, Hitler gets emergency powers to fight back against the evil commies, few years later, shoots himself in the head and hundreds of his followers are hung or arrested.\n\nIf history repeats itself, one hopes it goes all the way.",
