So far, it seems like they've fallen victim to the alt-right playbook (youtube series of videos, i highly recommend them). To describe it in a sentence: they're in an abusive relationship with alt-right ideology, that works to isolate them from nonbelievers by feeding them dog whistles that are offensive, but only if you know the dog whistle; and by feeding them \"edgy\" humor that's actually just plain racist/homophobic/transphobic, which they then repeat and are socially ostracized for. Repeat that enough times, and suddenly their only source of information is the alt-right, and they think they're victims of the \"culture war\" and \"cancel culture\".",

They've already normalised at least three points amongst normal people: trans people aren't valid, trans people are rapists, and trans women want to trick men into sleeping with them. This is a social stigma that we've been fighting to change for decades, and it feels like we've been taken back in time thirty years or so.\n\nThey may dress up their rhetoric, but that's just putting lipstick on a Nazi.",

Part of it is me just getting used to it, but it’s mostly that these repeated attempts to be overtly transphobic just get kinda sad over time. Nothing they do is creative, nothing they do feels genuine, I don’t even feel like I’m any less accepted. I know these people exist, and while I don’t want to make it sound like the job is done, at this point it’s just the death rattle of another failed conservative culture war.",
