The subreddit seems to be about 50-50 right now with rational people and alt-right douchebags. However, being a user there for a while and seeing this happen in other subs, its starting its descent.",

Then the mods of those subs allow hateful comments to remain and then we see what's happening to negativewithgold today.",
