He played with 3 friends taking turns all ready to hate the game before they knew what was to happen or expected with leaks to hate. A lot of people either YouTubed it or went in already wanting to hate it. Most that played whether they liked the story or not. Can’t say it doesn’t put a dent in your brain, to ask more of the current games we play. After it, I felt like most of the upcoming games just feel stupid and outdated now🤷🏻‍♂️ We can only play so many COD and Ubisoft AC style games that get 8/10 and 10/10 that come nowhere near this level of AI and gameplay....regardless of story. In a way this game ruined a lot modern day games for me, and not in a bad way. I can still play GOW or Horizion Dawn and feel fresh. But I can’t say the same now for up and coming games repurposing open worlds and beating this area then go here with a loose story thrown in. I just feel I have to demand more out of AI, game loops and environments now that TLOU2 showed off what’s possible.",

When I was playing it, I didn’t feel like the game was making me do anything. The one time that Ellie does kill a dog, it’s attacking her and she wouldn’t reasonably do anything else. Ellie is making these choices and the player interaction is there to hammer home the consequences of those choices.",

I really did not feel that any of that was there to make the player feel personally guilty on behalf of the character. This isn’t a game like Skyrim where the character and the player are interchangeable, and the use of multiple playable characters makes that even more clear.\n\nPlayers are given choice to the limits of what that character might choose to do. In a normal combat encounter, Ellie could conceivably choose to set up traps to blow up every dog she sees, or choose to sneak by all of them to make things easier. >!But if a dog jumps at her when she opens a door, she isn’t going to choose to not kill it.!<",
