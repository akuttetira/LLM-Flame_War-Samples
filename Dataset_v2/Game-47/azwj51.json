    "Post_Title": "As a Chinese player, I feel obliged to explain why most hackers are from China",
    "post_text ": "  \n\nThings are clear now, while playing PUBG, Apex or CSGO, if there is only one hacker in the battle, the whole experience will be horrible. And without exception, the majority of hackers are from China.\n\nFor the first time I know hacks, I was twelve years old, which is ten years ago. But things are way better than today. I witness the vicious spread of this grey industry chain, and today I want to explain why this happened.\n\nFirst thing I want to talk about is the choice between vanity and honor. There is a slang in China, “a child from another family”, which represent an ideal kid who is better than you in every way. You will hear the “legend” stories of this kid from your parents, teachers, and relatives. After telling you the story, they always tell you that you should get good grades like him, be talented like him, get as many prizes as he gets. They give you peer pressure by creating a fake kid, but they don’t teach you HOW to be this kid. So, all we know is competing with others, while they don’t care how we win a competition. So if you tell me that I can win a game without effort just by using hacks, yes of course I will use it, the majority of our generation don’t care about the honor of efforts or the way we win, we just care about that we can win.\n\nThe second thing is piracy. In China, steam was not widely known until 2015, pirate was our only option if we want to play PC games. Alone with those pirate games, we would also download what we called “modifier(I’m not sure if you guys call it this way)”. Almost all players from our generation experienced PlantsvsZombies with infinite sunlight, call of duty with infinity HP and ammo (Makarov can’t even kill you in “no Russian”). It is fun when we play the single player mod with modifiers, but it is also at this moment, some of us become dependent on software that can “boost” our performance. You might ask that piracy is also an issue in Russia, but why Chinese hackers are much more, this question leads to the third.\n\nI shall call the third reason “excess production capacity”. In the last decade, China experienced the explosive development of the Internet, major in Computer science was such a popular option in university. However, as the bubble burst, many programmers were not hired by mainstream companies. And a huge amount of them was worked for anti-virus software companies and now they are unemployed. You can imagine how easy it could be for them to create a hack by their knowledge. They need to survive, so they choose to degenerate. There are even competitions among those hack studios, I won’t tell you how, but I can assure you that you can purchase a hack of CSGO for a week for only 6 dollars. It is so easy to get and so cheap.\n\nAs we can see here, with the abnormal social education, dependence on “boosters” and cheap purchase channels, we are what we are now, the majority of game hackers. Those hackers don’t even know they are ruining the environment, they just want to pursue the pleasure over and over again, kind like drugs, right? Actually sometimes I feel pity for them, some of them even think that steam is the starter of PUBG and origin is the starter of Apex.\n\nPlease trust me, every time I see the news that Chinese players are ruining another game, I feel so powerless. I can’t explain to all hackers that how proud you would be if you win a game by your own effort, I can’t explain to you guys what are the reasons that caused this situation. Making hacks is illegal in China now, but we still can’t handle games like Apex which share global servers (because of the vague expressions in law).\n\nAnd also trust me that many players in China agree with my opinion, we feel shame about using hacks, but we are still minority. All we can do is advocating people around us not to use it. We are changing this situation, but it may cost years to change it for real.\n\nIf you have read this far, thanks for putting up with my poor English, it is midnight here, I still have classes tmr morning. If you have any questions, I will answer them at my best when I am available.",

I think a lot of people don't realize it's a social issue over there with the mentality of \"Win by absolutely any means necessary.\"\n\nIt's one of the things that some westerners might not be familiar with especially when talking about Asian gamers because there is, obviously, a cultural divide.\n\nWhat the OP presented is also common here in the Philippines. It's not just the \"win by absolutely any means\" mentality, it's also the social aspect of peer pressure and people wanting to emulate those who have success.\n\nOne of the reasons why microtransactions became popular during the early-2000s in our online PC games was because these were seen as \"status symbols.\"\n\nIt's been ingrained in our society -- from the basic building blocks of a family to larger communities -- that you'd want to achieve success, and you'd look up to people who've obtained the experience and the means to achieve that success.\n\n- \"Tingnan mo yung pinsan mo, mayaman.\" -- Look at your cousin, he's rich.\n\n- \"Yung kapitbahay natin ang daming pera.\" -- Our neighbor has a lot of money.\n\n- \"Yung kaklase mo, ang galing galing sa Math at English.\" -- Your classmate is good in Math and English classes.\n\nFrom a young age, you realize that you need to reach that level and to even surpass those whom you are being compared to. It's a common trait in Asian culture, I believe. Heck, you'd even see Asian stand-up comedians joking about their childhoods or what their parents were like.",

I think we need to get past these primitive notions of fairness and realise that we should do what produces better outcomes for people, rather than what we decide they \"deserve\".",

Think of our Sherlocks, Houses, Monks, or any number of TV geniuses who have photographic memories. They are not hard workers they are natural geniuses. People didn't work hard they are just smart. The athlete isn't well trained they are talented. This idea of innate greatness pervades our fiction and culture in pretty much every level. Such is the reason for the participation trophy. When talent is believed to be innate no trophy indicates an innate deficit to the participant that is impossible to overcome. Sure you get your underdog stories but even then you here things like \"There is greatness in you\" or \"You can't teach real talent\" because hard work is to find something that is already great about you not to build greatness.\n\nThen in the east the idea is reversed but also in the extreme. Anybody can be successful so if you are not you are lazy. That is why the comparisons are used, they are like you but better so obviously its because you aren't working hard enough or doing what it takes to be successful. In Korea the obsession with memorization and competition has skyrocketed our suicide rate and yeah our grades are better but the cost is just too damn high.",

I personally believe that participation trophies do more harm than good, but encouraging a \"best effort\" is good in that a person's self-esteem is still rewarded by acknowledgement without pretending that they achieved an accomplishment that they have in fact not attained.

Westerners don't look at it as winning, they look at it as cheating.\n\nBut Chinese gamers don't care that they aren't actually good at the game, they don't care that a bot aims for them or whatever.

Sure, you may \"win\" a game of PuBG, but it's a completely hollow, unfulfilling victory because your skill level had nothing to do with it, it was done by software.\n\nIf you see someone who is better than you at something or more successful than you it should motivate you to improve yourself legitimately.

Whatever I want to do. They’ll support. They had my back. But in the end it always came down to, X is studying this and made it into med school. X is a nurse now. Y is a teaching now. Etc. comparisons after comparisons. And why don’t you do the same or asking what my plan is. And honestly. I didn’t have a plan. My sister and I broke that mold. We grew up being told how someone was successful. That we should do that. Or why not study this like X. We were always told what we should do but NEVER were we shown how. Whether it be our parents themselves or them guiding us the best they can. It was pretty much getting tossed in the water, and figuring it ourselves. One of the biggest things, was money. All they said was save save save save. When asked how. They said “well you save, open a savings account” and sure that’s the cut and dry of it. But they never discussed the discipline and the habit of it. This went for many things, they were full of “suggestions” but without any follow up. And I feel growing up, that’s follow up is definitely something children and teens need. I know that’s what I am doing with my children now, I don’t just tell em, I show them. Even when they don’t think they need to be shown or don’t even think of asking how.",

Which I'd imagine is more expensive then the China version. If it's a multiplayer game, chances are they're not pirating it, since it's kinda hard to get around looking like you have a legit copy when connecting to multiplayer servers. Throw even the $15 a month on a VPN service, it starts adding up, especially for a player in China. That's why I said region locks would probably deter most Chinese players from hopping on Western servers to cheat",

Now if the game is region locked as in banned in your country, then yes you would have to VPN to that region to play it each time, but having to pay for a VPN wouldn't be much of a deterrent.

If you were on the US server you would have to buy a US key. It's not about making it harder to circumvent a ip ban entirely but more about making the cost that much higher. If a chinese gamer has to pay full US price to play on US servers they can but it will cost 2x-10x as much as doing so on the Asian servers. This alone could cut down the percentage of recurring hackers down. However this wouldn't stop people who don't care from buying cheap stolen credit card codes and accounts, but even that takes more work from the hackers to play.",

Ping was an issue, although this has become far less of a problem, but the problem mostly rests with language barriers.\n\nI eventually found a 3rd party app for CSGO that automatically blocks all of Valve's servers and you have to whitelist the servers you want to play on. I only ticked the one in Amsterdam and the UK, and i suddenly had a lot less Eastern European, Russian and Turkish players in my games. I really have nothing against you guys - but i do spite you for the fact you dont speak English. (Granted, i do meet a lot of Germans that barely speak English too) It's not my first language either. Communication is key to victory. And we cannot communicate if we don't both speak the same language.",

And there aren't enough servers in the Australian region to begin with.\n\nGo back to an older game like BF4 and there are around 2 or 3 Australian servers available.  We have to play in Asia, or the US or Europe because there simply aren't enough local servers.

Hacking takes that away and makes it purely about winning, so what is even the point? There's no recognition or awards for people that win by hacking and it presumably takes any fun out of it.\n\nI guess I can't really wrap my head around what is obviously a very different cultural paradigm. The whole \"win by any means\" and just ignoring the importance of actual effort is something I have a hard time grasping. Especially in a culture that pushes their kids to be the absolute best and most successful. It almost seems hypocritical in a way - be the best even if it means cheating, in which case, you're not the best because you had to cheat.",

They obviously score way higher than anyone else. I make a big point of saying \"you won't be able to have your notes in the exam so don't rely on them\" in front of the class but they just laugh it off. Next mock test half the class started cheating because after the last one they fiercely compared scores. This happened with nearly every single group I ever taught. There were of course a few solid people who didn't cheat the entire way through or just used their notes as a crutch so as to not flub their early mocks but those types normally went into the less intense classes where you actually learn English, not how to pass a test.",

They cheat non- stop, for the most part the professors know, but it’s almost impossible to prove. Some of them are legit, engaged and willing to learn: but there’s a LARGE margin who don’t even come to class, pay others to write their papers, and basically ruin it for those of us who are actually trying. The mindset isn’t based around gaming, it’s how they were raised.\n\nIt doesn’t matter if you’re actually the best in your field, as long as other people think you are.",

Also, I haven’t talked about any Activision game in a long while, unless the topic is Destiny 2 and that’s no longer an Activision game either.",
