It's rather bulky and definitely heavier than ds4. With that said it's by far the most comfortable controller I've used. Oh yea performance is great too!",

While Sony can release updates to the PS4 OS that adjust features for the DualShock 4—such as the post-launch ability to dim the light bar—the device itself lacks an independent update system.",

Yeah, I've found playing PS4 remote play is FANTASTIC, the only thing that is annoying is the fact the touch pad doubles as a mouse cursor.\n\nWhenever I need to get to a menu, look at the map, or change my gear, especially in a hurry, it's just not happening. I actually just died to a boss in The Surge 2 because he came out of nowhere and I needed to change my gear, but trying to open the menu was just fucking me up more lol.\n\nDo you have any tips on how to NOT use the \"mouse functionality\" and just use the touchpad as... well, the touchpad? I really would appreciate an answer on this as it would make my three hours of remote play PS4 at the end of work much more enjoyable. LOL.",
