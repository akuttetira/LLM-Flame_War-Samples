Kind of like that person who could pre-release movie screeners back in the day and could never shut up about it.",

I wouldn’t like at all to be forced into that situation.\n\nAlso very interesting how diverse the Last of Us world got in the course of just 5 years. It’s cool to be more diverse for representing the crowd of people playing but when your entire world shifts to a whole new way of living in just 5 years. Bizzare. I guess the apocalypse brings out the good in people?",

Any deviation was received as a breath of fresh air, so where exactly did you read all those \"I want a white male protagonist\" oppinions. Source?\n\nI for instance read the spoilers but I'm still open to the game and hope it's gonna be good. In the spoilers discussions people never mentioned a need for white male protagonists, but instead of the story paths which were terrible.\n\nYou mentioned also (like a 10y child) that people have problems with women who have a strong build. Nobody said \"a woman shouldn't be like that\", but people argued how a person in that time would be able to find enough muscle sustaining food, while many are starving to death. Hunting is one argument, but all the areas are sepperated into gang regions, so someone who hunts down a big animal hast to share it. Many think Neil implemented this with a purpose to support his political views, which should never be in any game.\n\nAgain, show a source of people wanting a white male as a protagonist. For that I'm really curious.",

I don’t think it’s fair to rip into one character if we’re going to talk about inconsistencies in muscle mass. I think the point is, why did it matter with her when it literally didn’t matter with any other character?",

I don’t think it takes much thought to realise what they’re trying to portray. In a world like Ellie lives in, it makes total sense to me that she’s going to be attracted to something.....don’t know how to say it without sounding sexist. But something less frightening and typically more comforting\n\nI have a lesbian friend who’s built like a brick shit house. She had to do that for herself to survive in the brutal upbringing she’s had. Never mind the world of The Last of Us",

Personally i thought it's stupid to cry about story from out of context events from a leak. That said, it's insane how people are twisting it to 'Oh you just don't like women!'. I'm sure some people are like that, but most people who were outraged over the leaks were about how the story unfolds.",

Happened with this game, happened with Red Dead 2, happened with Bioware, will probably happen with Cyberpunk again before it's out. Usually it starts with a Jason Schreier article. And it's usually forgotten about after a few weeks, until he posts another article 8 months later.\n\nCrunch is absolutely a legitimate issue, don't get me wrong. It's 1000x more damaging to the games industry than gay protagonists or whatever the fuck else Gamerbros complain about lol. The brutal crunch is driving talented developers away from Naughty Dog. But it's an issue that plagues almost all AAA studios, not just ND.\n\nI almost *wish* crunch was the reason people were upset at Naughty Dog, at least it actually matters. But no, we live in a world where Gamers get more upset about women with big arms than game developers working absolutely ludicrous hours and crunching 12+ months away from release. It's sad.",

They think it sucks shit, the word spreads that it sucks shit. This really isn't helped by people being rightly pissed off that ND is no exception when it comes to crunch culture. I'm of the general opinion that a similar thing likely would have happened if the first game's ending had been spoiled. Many people hated it even in context at launch so I can only imagine the outcry in 2013 if bad press like this got pushed months before launch. I'll respect the game on its own merits and hopefully it was worth being so skeptical over this long (skeptical of the criticisms).",
