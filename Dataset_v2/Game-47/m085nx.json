Do they not matter?”\n\nThe fastest way to downplay the importance of Women’s Day is by saying “What about men’s day?”\n\nAs a middle class, healthy, white male, I’m really fucking tired of people thinking that I need some special day to help *my people* stand out from the crowd. I am the fucking crowd. People like me have systematically fucked over groups for *NOT* being like me. Let’s undo that. These days serve to recognize that.\n\nBut for real, thanks for putting it into such a bite sized approach.",
