People are delusional conspiracy theorists and will just go to their grave insisting that Sony and ND are lying when there's legit fucking no evidence to back up the idea that it was an employee.\n\nHumanity really needs to be culled.

He pretty much confirmed the exact same thing.\n\nThis could very well be  PR damage control but I don't think it is. Reason being that this is not what ND themselves posted, but a third party and the fact that this won't do much. Whatever happened, happened. This info won't mean much in the grand scheme of things. People who believe ND is at fault will continue to believe so. People who think it wasn't ND/Sony got one more reason to continue beleiving so.\n\nIf this was something Druckmann himself posted, I'd be right there with you. Like a company or not, I'd like some third party perspective more than anything. But we only have unsubstantiated reddit/4chan rumors on one hand and several 3rd parties saying the opposite. For now, I go with the latter, until new info comes up.\n\nI'm more interested in seeing what info these 3rd parties can come up with, rather than what ND themselves have to say.",

To me it's because of how deeply emotionally involved I feel with the characters, their story and development throughout the game.\n\nThis is not just another FPS, it's  one of the very few games, where I actually care about what happens to the characters, and because of that, it means a lot not knowing what happens. If I know the future of the characters, the story up till that point will suddenly feel hollow.\n\nPlease do yourself a favor and keep yourself spoiler free... and now, go get TLOU 1 and start playing.",

Have you ever went to drink something expecting it to be pop but it was actually milk and the utter disgust you have when reality didn't match your expectations.
