But I also think that most people who are going to play it on a PC would rather wait for a port than buy a PS5. specially if they start seeing more games being ported.\n\nWe are already seeing the term \"Xbox exclusive\" having less value because most, if not all of them are going to end up in PC. But Microsoft is betting on selling subscriptions not consoles. If Sony keeps going that way, they might end up pulling a MS sooner or later.",

I think Sony could make their own launcher and keep 100% of the profits and that'd be just as good as owning windows. PC gamers love to bitch about launchers but if we're talking day 1 releases, I'd gladly use Sony's to get *good* pc ports for their exclusives.",

But if Sony brings their games to PC, especially PS5 games which are designed from the ground up on the PS5, they would look a lot better than Halo Infinite.",

Older games coming to PC after a long time should be seen as a good thing, more people playing a game is a good thing.

Graphics settings doing nothing at all cause they're broken. When Digital Foundry says your port is bad, it's bad, even more so considering how hard they praised HZD when it came out initially.",

On top of allowing more people to play them, it also makes it easier for people to play games from past generations. I never had a PS3 or an Xbox 360, but through PC I've been able to play games from that generation.\n\nAnd while it makes sense for Sony not to port their titles to Xbox, the PC market is distinct enough from the home console market that it should increase game sales without hurting console sales that much. Many PC users like PC, and buy neither an Xbox or a PlayStation, so porting games to PC allows Sony to sell to that market, which wasn't going to buy a PlayStation anyways.",

Just buy a PC and play it better.\n\nExclusives are the lifeblood of consoles. Nintendo wouldn't be where they are without Mario/Zelda, and Sony wouldn't be where it is without God of War/ The Last of Us.\n\nAnd they can complain about oh this is best for everyone or whatever, but it isn't. It's best for everyone but PlayStation. They expect us to fight for them but when it comes down to it they would never fight for us. If a game releases on PC only they would brag about it the same.\n\nAnd exclusives sell.

Surely the more people who experience your favourite games the better?\n\nPersonally I buy almost every PS exclusive on launch and I would absolutely be double dipping on a PC release of each game.
