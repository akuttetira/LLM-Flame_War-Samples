If anyone can make a sequel to one of the best games of all time, and tell another incredible story, it’s these guys. I have no reason to think they didn’t pull it off again. Haters are dumb enough to think that they decided to go “woke” and sacrifice everything about the first game that was so loved - why tf would a game 7 years in development by one of the best studios in the industry not be an amazing one??",

Another thing is that these ppl haven’t even played the game but have already decided to hate it because of the leaks - they don’t have a valid reason to hate it but reviewers that give it a 9/10+ have a valid to reason to love it because they’ve played the whole thing",
