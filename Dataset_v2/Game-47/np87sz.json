I can always come on here and debate things, but facebook is like my front yard or something.\n\n\nOf the few people I can think who even still posts on there, likely for the same reasons I don't, most don't reply any more.\n\n\nIt really is quite a sorry state of affairs. Perhaps I lean too heavily to the online status of relationships. I know some people just don't do that well, but.. Yes you're quite right. I don't have the power to really alter his actions, or anyone's.\n\n\nSad after such a long friendship, but.. Onwards..",

I got one, but since the SSD is non replaceable, kinda waiting for the m.2 update. I enjoy it but wouldn't recommend it. If someone likes it, they'll fall into it themselves, don't need me to encourage them towards it. Just have fun playing the games, and if you see a fun platinum like ghost of Tsushima or GoW, go for it if your having fun.",

Vita was Sony's second handheld console. M.2 is a type of storage drive/hard drive that you can put in the ps5 to add more space. The ps5 only comes with like 660 gigs of space for games. Sony is planning to release a software update that adds m.2 support in the summer. After that, you could buy a m.2 drive, Pop it in, and add lots of space for your ps5 games.\n\nAs for MW2, it's fun to play/plat, the veterans difficulty can be hard though, and beating that obstacle course under time for that trophy can require lots of practice. Give it a shot if you feel up to it :P",

And yeah ive never even heard of the Vita, but I have something similar to the M.2 for PS4 and Xbox, which basically just an extended storage that also can be transferred, not sure what it’s called though. Also I’m pretty sure I beat MW2 or realism, or maybe I’m thinking of the new MW. Either way I know I beat it on the hardest and geez there’s this one mission that I remember sucking to get past. If the Vita is anything like the PSP, I had one of those for a while too. As well as GameCube, Nintendo and Wii, not sure if those are considered “old school” yet or not, though. Anyway yeah hopefully you get that M.2 soon for your PS5 👍🏻\n\nEdit: hopefully they **make** the M.2 soon, since you can’t get it yet. Poor wording in my comment lol\n\nEdit 2: or if it’s already made hopefully they make it compatible for PS5, or something, lol",
