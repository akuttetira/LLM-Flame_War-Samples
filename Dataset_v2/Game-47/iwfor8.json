Even CP 2077 will run on a potato.\nI’m still using gtx 1080 i bought when it was still considered a beast, still playing on 1440p, just not getting consistent 144 fps anymore.Newest doom ran flawlessly. Games i enjoy the most right now? Fkn indies like Hades. Any reason to freak out about rtx 3080 ? Zero. Even if you got your hands on such card what you would play? Garbage like cod in 4k? Microsoft flight simulator?",

I can actually read text on other car's liveries when it's on my monitor as opposed to my vr headset.",

My motivation for wanting a new card is primarily because my son is using a single GTX 760. (it was in SLI, but the second card isn't working right, and most games don't really take great advantage of it anyway.) With the price point similar to what the 2000 series was going for, it looks pretty attractive. Eventually supply will catch up; I just hope prices aren't higher then. I got my card right around the downturn from bitmining and it was still more expensive than my husband's 1070. (He wants the 3080 primarily so he can run 144 fps in everything and for VR.)",
