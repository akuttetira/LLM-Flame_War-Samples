They're already the bad guy.\n\nAlso the reason they're doing shit like this in the first place is because there is currently a lot of controversy over preorder content and the like, and as such they know that releasing a game that does not contain stuff like that is what appeals to the market at the moment. If we were a few years ago and consumers hadn't become wary enough yet not to get distracted by shiny preorder content, it is almost certainly exactly what they'd do.",

And the mocking is because CDPR released one game that rocked the world and you've got people un-ironically calling them the messiah of gaming like that. And don't @ me about track records when 90% of the current fanbase didn't play 1&2 before 3 came out, if they'd even heard of the franchise at all. I really want the game to succeed but I also don't want it to fail and see nothing but \"you were supposed to be the chosen one\" memes from people that for all intents and purposes only watched episode II.",
