After a month of daily playing (doing daily challenges) you maxed out your multiplier for gold gains at 2.5X normal, and you kept the multiplier forever if you kept playing daily.\n\nIn the latest patch, not only was the amount of gold per daily challenge cut in half, but the multiplier resets after a month. IE before the patch on day 29 you'd be making 0.5 gold per challenge. Now on day 29 you're making 0.1 gold per challenge. It's a pretty big fuck you considering the new DLC content they released costs a total of 55 full gold bars to buy. I don't want to do the math but needless to say, your grinding for a damn long time, and those Gold bar bundles you can buy from R* for real money start to look a lot more appealing",

Imagine if GTAO never got heists, but they kept saying they were coming soon... for years, and years... and then they announced a photographer instead.",
