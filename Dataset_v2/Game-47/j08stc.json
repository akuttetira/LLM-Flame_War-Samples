The game is writing contrivence incarnate. Neil has said this himself multiple times. Even stating he wanted to make a girl people could look up to. instead he made the worlds most decisively warped amnesia induced characters gaming has ever seen with nothing redeemable about them let alone to the point of a role model.\n\ni dont visit that subreddit. I dont care people hate a virtual character and I dont care people love one. Its a shit story and a huge failure writing wise with a masculine political stance given form.\n\nShe hulk had her personality absolutely attached to her build. To the point she is called \"Abs\" its preschool writing. Her whole story is. Even making a throwaway gym schedule to prove she does indeed workout.\n\nStop acting like people who make fun of this terrible contrived agenda of a product are somehow lesser beings and trolls or something just because you want to suck off the creator telling him how mind blowing his vision is or something.\n\nFuck this game. Fuck the fans. You are a dismisisve and cognitive dissonent fandom that use misplaced shame to judge people and opinions because you cant admit the story and characters are a bloody fucking mess of a pretencious and petty man.\n\nI dont knownif its because you people have never red a story. Because you feel younidentity conected to the game. But when you fans actually get challenged with facts and point from the story you shrink awt calling people bigots, trolls and more.\n\n\"dunno ifbyou are lastofuspart2ing but i liked her character\"\n\nGood for you. Many more didnt. Get the fuck over the fact people think the creator, the game and the characters fucking suck.",
