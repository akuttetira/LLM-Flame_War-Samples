            "Reply_Text": "The biggest shocker on this is that Ubisoft is actually optimizing their game to properly utilize the hardware. Even 2080Tis couldn’t do 4K 60 FPS on AC odyssey.\n\nEdit: Yes I understand there’s a difference between the low to mid to high to ultra settings. This wasn’t to say the 2080 sucks, it’s the opposite, 2080Ti is powerful and should run games really really well. But (especially at launch) it couldn’t run 4K 60 FPS on any settings (has since improved significantly). This is to say Ubisoft games are notoriously not optimized.\n\nAlso, the XSX ram Gears of War 5 at 4K, 60FPS (up to 100) on ultra settings with some settings not included on PC release. PS5 isn’t quite as powerful but just putting out as an example. This is not to trigger PCMR, if anything it’s to support it.",

And considering I'll save money from not buying subscriptions the price of a console ends up going up over time while pc does not.\n\nEven if I built a $700 pc at the start of the last gen, I would have spent less than someone who bought a console. A ps4 was $400 at launch and by the end of it with ps plus it will have been a total of $820. Which means I saved $120 from going pc.\n\nAnd with the people who upgraded to a ps4 pro that adds an extra $400 widens the gap as its now at $1220. Could the person who went pc have upgraded? Sure, but that amount is enough to where upgrading is not needed.",

Cables? Most $500 builds I’ve seen are complete shit and won’t handle any recent games, much less future ones)",

Hell, despite how limited the hardware of this gen was even at release, we got some astonightly amazing-looking games in the last 7 years.\n\nIf a game looks gorgeous, do you care if it's Medium or Ultra settings?

I spend too much time fiddling with graphics settings and mods that I never end up finishing a game. I prefer consoles for the simplicity.",

NVIDIA and AMD release updates for their drivers that allow their GPU's to support the game in the most efficient and capable ways. There's some work by the devs to get any specific features on board, but none more than consoles. That's just speaking in terms of capability.\n\n\nThis \"optimization\" that consoles have is just the devs going in and saying \"we can put the grass at medium, the render distance at high, and the texture quality at ultra.\" Sometimes they go in-between those settings, like a medium-high setting but it's all just a puzzle to see what they can sacrifice to reach the desired resolution while not losing too much visual fidelity. PC's can do that too, it just takes some work from the user by reading guides, watching the DF videos, or just experimenting to see what you need to do to get it working well. NVIDIA actually has a program that optimizes games for you based on what they consider the best experience for your graphics card to be. It's hit or miss, but a decent option for those unaware of what to do when it comes to game settings. So while consoles are more plug and play and easier for the user, the devs don't put in any effort for optimization on PC because that's the users choice on PC. Not everyone wants 4K high, some want 1440 Ultra.",

He hit 4k 60 by turning down settings, very much in the same way that the consoles will achieve 4k 60. This was on a rtx 2060 super which isn't a high end card, closer to a mid-range card from 2019. A 2080ti could do 4k 60 on ACO.\n\nWhen Odyssey first came out it had horrible optimization problems on all fronts. I bought the game shortly after launch on my PS4 pro and returned it because I wasn't happy with the quality of the game. I returned to it back in March on my PC and much to my surprise the game's optimization and gameplay issues were mostly fixed. The game is in a good state now and I loved my 100+ hrs with it.\n\nAt this point it isn't worth getting too hyped for Valhalla. Let's wait and see how it actually holds up when we get the game.",

It’s usually in the settings, with console versions never running at maxed out settings which are benchmarked on pc gpus.",

My 2080ti can do 4K60FPS with ray tracing if I set it to medium-ish settings. Also, to be fair, the 2080ti came out 2 years ago.",

Many of these ultra/max settings options are just kinda overkill options for those with the spare power, cuz why not?\n\nAs usual, people here dont understand how this stuff works.

Also the XsX will probably run third party titles slightly better because it is set up more traditionally and third party devs are less likely to use the PS5’s proprietary features, so the raw horsepower of the XsX will be better there.",
