    "post_text ": "EDIT - HOD Gaming has been unbanned but Wildcard's statement was pretty much damage control in response to this and didn't address anything about the actual exploits which HOD got banned for in the first place. The usual \"we are working on it\" that we have been hearing for 3 years now so I doubt much will change. Full statement -   [https://survivetheark.com/index.php?/articles.html/official-statement-regarding-hod-gaming-and-game-exploits-r1137/](https://survivetheark.com/index.php?/articles.html/official-statement-regarding-hod-gaming-and-game-exploits-r1137/) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA popular ARK youtuber, H.O.D Gaming, recently made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrxxwnyFkuY) exposing some of ARK's glitches that have been in the game for years. Because of the nature of the game (a PvP survival game) these bugs let people destroy other player's thousands of hours of work in just a few minutes.\n\nAs a response to this video, the developers of ARK [have globally banned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85CemXW6lPA) one of their most dedicated content creators.\n\nThis is an issue that players have been trying to get fixed for 2 years, that's right TWO YEARS. The only way to get something done about this is go public and put Studio Wildcard under fire.\n\nJust to clear it up, HOD never used these exploits on online servers, the only thing he did is demonstrate them on a singleplayer game.\n\nIf you have bought the game consider leaving a negative review if you have been affected by these bugs.\n\nEDIT - Some more videos about this from the ARK community for people who are interested:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh2-OhnobC0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh2-OhnobC0)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8XS-aDQ3gw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8XS-aDQ3gw)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG2hXxY8yqs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG2hXxY8yqs)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj88OlB\\_X70](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj88OlB_X70)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYZDl9MYqIY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYZDl9MYqIY&t=123s)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxv0T--0qDU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxv0T--0qDU)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL:DR - Youtuber tries to fix exploits by making it public, gets banned by the game devs.",

The bugs combined with them selling me half a game but saying it is full, requiring me to pay even more for the game even after i bought it, completely ruined the experience.",

Used a local discord to LFG a couple weeks and made a decent amount of friends. If I ever play ranked atleast one of those guys are always online and they all have friends of their own. That said... having a core of 5 friends who always queue together is incredible fun.",

They input things in game that actually effect the code, since the NES has such a small file size, forcing you to basically beat the game.\n\nWhat you found is not modifying the files, it's modifying how the game reads the files, right? The bugged map forces it to cache the object because it thinks it's correct, but it isn't so it just shows up as invisible. So you're tricking the game cache. I wouldn't call that modding, because it can happen just by accident by joining a bugged map on some random server. Everyone can agree it's cheating if you go out of your way to do it and should be fixed, though.",

This was also during the \"play early\" period before the official full release and that patch was the \"day 1\" patch. He got banned for \"exploiting resource economy\" or something to that effect even though he only messed around with it for a very shot amount of time then continuing to play the game normally. Keep in mind this is a PVE only game, there is no economy because there is no trading or pvp so this doesn't even impact other players let alone negatively affect their experience.\n\nIMO there are glitches that are clear exploits that have a massive negative impact on players experiences, then there are ones like this that are just fun and opportunistic for a period of time. Ones like this don't deserve being punished especially taking the entire context of the situation.\n\nTo Bioware's credit, they did rescind the ban after he contacted them and explained what was going on.  The damage was done though, he likely won't return to the game and they lose out a lot of content creator presence in the game and \"free advertisement\" that helps keep a playerbase and bring new people to the game. They basically killed their game overnight with this blunder. I can only imagine how many people got banned that aren't content creators or influencers that maybe werent' as lucky or got unbanned.",

I really hope you are actually trolling right now\n\nThe idea is that making it a bannable offense will deter most people from cheating, same goes with crime, and it is proven that increased crime enforcement results in decreased crime overall, thus your claim that it doesn't \"stop crime\" is false, it mitigates crime, it reduces it to a much needed, drastic degree.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's probably alot of illegal things that you'd want to do, but you wouldn't because you know you have things to lose, this is the idea of an anticheat, you will lose all your progress, money from buying the game, and potentially all of your reputation if caught, if an improved client side anticheat would catch these cheaters on a quicker basis, then cheaters would lose money much faster re-buying the game, and i know it's hard to believe but most cheaters aren't rich, it's just the fact that they usually get banned within every 2-3 months or so and they can afford $15 every 2-3 months as even most poor people can.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot only that but valve is clearly ignoring the concept of HWID banning, although it is bypassable, if implemented right it is an absolute hassle to bypass, two great examples of these are fortnite's HWID banning system and ESEA's HWID banning system.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>you should know why it's difficult to catch cheaters IN F2P game as it's  somewhat pointless because they can create new account and do this  again.\n\nI'm not talking about the free to play servers, i am specifically talking about the paid servers, aka prime servers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>so the only thing that \"stops\" (or hide them, lol) is trust factor.\n\nIt doesn't really work because if there is not a high amount of players currently in your area to matchmake, and if no one is close to your trust factor at that time of searching for other players, you will be connected to a much wider range of a trust factor score regardless of how legit you are, for players like me who have a nightly sleep schedule, trust factor is essentially useless, and it is a band-aid, rather than an actual fix, which would be an improved client-side anticheat, they wanted as little false positives as possible, and with that decision they sacrificed the effectivity of the anticheat as a whole, there is not much that can be done with server-side anticheats, sure they are a great addition and a much needed layer of cheat mitigation, but the primary focus should definitely be on the client-side anticheat as that component can detect incriminating code being ran on the user's machine, and contrary to popular belief, if written carefully, it can be done without the user sacrificing his privacy to play the game.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, side note, don't downvote me because i called you out for talking out of your ass , it is pretty obvious you probably have no programming skills or even basic knowledge of how an anticheat works, if you didn't downvote me i wouldn't add this in, but i really do hate it when people try to use the downvote system over personal bias and not clearcut objective fact.",

At no point did I ever say anything to imply that ark’s map is unlimited. My point is that they’re much larger than any cs go map and almost every object can be interacted with. Your inability to understand this from my original comment leads me to believe you’re either extremely uncharitable or extremely dense. Most likely both.",
