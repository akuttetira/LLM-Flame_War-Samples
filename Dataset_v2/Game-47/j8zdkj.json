It happened literally once, out of someone who has 5 thousand videos and countless streams.\n\nYet most of the media still tries to make him the bad guy at any moment just cause they're scared of the actual influence he has, compared to some outdated publishers. He's done more charity work than everyone shitting on him tenfold, and has done it without bragging or letting his ego involved.\n\nLike if you're really hating on Felix at this point its just sad and such a shame, since he's one of the few guys out there that's still keeping it 100% real and can actually unite us.",
