Everyone has their own opinions and entitled to their opinions in a democratic society. I’m gay and proud and bro, if you don’t like gay people or anti-gay marriage, I’m just hoping one day you will change your mind.\n\nI’m not going to shove my beliefs down somebodies throat and get angry at people for having opposing views. That’s just childish and immature as fuck.\n\nYou childish CIS people gotta stop being so damn fragile more than us gays. Jesus fucking Christ.",

But for completeness, a quick scan of this asshole's post history reveals:\n\nWithin the past few weeks, he's claimed to be a college student (both currently and 10 years ago), ex-lawyer, game developer, teenager, multimillionaire, father and married 7 years to a woman of the \"opposite sex\". He's also labeled himself a conservative, liberal, progressive, and centrist all in this period. And let's not gloss over referring to both himself and his friends as \"colored people\" (?!). The only thing he's been consistent about is being Korean, and given all the other bullshit, I'm not sure we can even believe that much.\n\nDude is sketchy as hell, almost certainly full of bullshit and has some issues to work out.",

If someone openly fights trans rights then I don't want to support that person. It's as simple as that.\n\nIt's not just someone with \"opposing views\", it's someone who is actively against our very existence. I don't want to roll over and have transphobia and homophobia become the norm. It's not being fragile, it's giving a fuck about those who are suffering from transphobia every single day.",
