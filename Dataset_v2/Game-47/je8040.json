The AI and graphics sucks...\n\nThis was my first Soul's type game and the game must be a pretty good game in the genre because everyone likes it, but I am curious why do you play it? The gameplay isn't even that good, Nioh's gameplay is just amazing with great focus on sword fighting, whereas you gotta dodge and find a rhythm to BloodBorne.",

The level design is very confusing too, small ledges and no recovery, Nioh you can recover from fall... Just these make dying in Nioh, your fault. But BloodBorne doesn't give opportunities and I wouldn't like to spend a lot of time in a game, whose game mechanics I hate.\n\nI know it saves automatically when you exit.",
