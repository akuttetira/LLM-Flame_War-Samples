Old film projectors work by having a 24 frame film and then show each frame twice, or practically speaking they may pass a black bar through while each frame is being displayed, so in effect it seems like 48 frames per second even though the film only has 24 different frames per second.\n\nDigital can support much higher and variable frame rates. And that was a frequent complaint about early all digital films and projectors. Folks didn't think it looked the same as the lower frame rate celluloid film.",

Miles is initially animated in 12fps, but during the dual swinging scene with Peter Parker he gradually syncs up to 24. The \"choppy\" animation showed his awkwardness with his new abilities, and the sync up to a higher framerate was one of the artistic ways they showed Miles progressing into becoming Spider-Man.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/5PiYGLR3Wv8?t=447",

It’s literary license to use something like cancelled to describe the effect and intent of your comment.  The purpose of your comment was to ridicule him for having a different opinion than you, and also to get others to join in on putting him down and devaluing his speech because this is a public forum.  This of course is similar to how people on twitter will campaign to “cancel” those they disagree with by ratio-ing their tweets, trying to get them fired, and other methods to silence the speech they do not like.\n\nSo, even though these two scenarios are not the exact same, they do share in many qualities. By saying that what you did was “cancelling” him, he intentionally exaggerates the situation by using hyperbole, and also calls to mind the nature of the internet mob and how ignorant people can be.\n\nI would call this “artistic” in a certain sense, so who here really appreciates and understands the subjective nature of art?  But I digress, you should get back to being the arbiter of what is and isn’t art, the world needs you.",
