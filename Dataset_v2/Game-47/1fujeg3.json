Which both still suffer from to this day.\nHowever, I don't see any kind of anti Masculinity in GOW in fact, it can be pro Masculinity considering how Kratos develops as a character.",

Drinking tons of alcohol makes you gain a 'beer gut' should you not counteract it with exercise, and though he's a God, he drinks more of a godly amount of beer over the amount of godly exercise he gets.  Plus, you can have a lot of muscle and a lot of fat at the same time.  One of my Drill Instructors from USMC boot camp, (Gunny Richardson, one of the manliest sons'a'bitches I know,) had a beer gut but was the strongest of all of my DIs.  Dude was a fucking tank and still is.  Odin has Gunny Richardson's build, and it makes sense within the narrative.  I'm not saying GoW isn't infested with some woke shit, but honestly, they did this version of Thor just fine imho.",

There were sexualized and non-sexualized women in video games before, just like there were hyper-masculine and non-hyper-masculine men in video games before. Western studios, though, have had a heavy push towards the latter for both men and women in recent years. The fact that you're so hardup for tits that you only notice cleavage being covered, and not men becoming pussies, says more about you than it does about the industry. From the difference between end-bosses [Zeus](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Zv_VRIcDe24/maxresdefault.jpg) and [Odin](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/vsbattles/images/8/8e/ODIN_COSPLAY_GUIDE_RAGNAROK.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20230701021409) to even the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on the [SNES](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i9eZ3JAWjfo/maxresdefault.jpg) compared to their versions [now](https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles-Mutants-Unleashed.jpg), there's a concerted effort to feminize men, which you might notice if you weren't such a soy boy yourself.",

How come some Western superhero games still steroid abusing male leads? How come Dustborne, a woke game, still have a handsome boy band type character? Do you even know that in a recent Western Spider-game game, you are able to unlock a \"costume\" to play him just in his underwear?\n\nI am sure you know that the Western mainstream games media is a megaphone for the games industry and a major indicator of what the agenda and trends are.\n\nTherefore again, *show me an example of the Western mainstream games media and the woke/feminists complaining of male characters being too handsome and muscley and how them having visible six packs is objectifying and sexualizing men and driving away the male audience.*\n\nYou can keep defecating \"muh strawman\" in response yet you cannot provide one (which would be a unicorn anyway) or even a few examples of it.\n\nEven if there really was a push for male characters to be \"censored\" or \"uglified\" (which I don't think there is), it is nowhere near the push for female characters to censored and uglfied, which would be 99.5% female characters targeted for this treatment compared to 0.5% or less for male characters to have this treatment.\n\n>The fact that you're so hardup for tits\n\nUsing woke insults now are we? Mask slipping perhaps?\n\nI can reverse this and say that you're so hardup for d\\*\\*k that you don't notice the tits being censored far more.\n\n>that you only notice cleavage being covered\n\nThe entire Western mainstream games media, games industry, developers, publishers, Rainbow groups, feminist groups, woke groups on social media and websites pushing for censorship and uglification of attractive female characters and praising ugly female characters.\n\nNot to mention virtually 100% of the censorship and uglification happening to female characters.\n\nYeah, anyone would tend to notice the cleavage being covered.\n\n>and not men becoming pussies\nthere's a concerted effort to feminize men, which you might notice\n\nI have noticed that. However, this is different and separate issue to censorship and uglification, as male characters/men being feminized is virtually always regarding their characterization and personalities, and not their physical traits which is what this thread is about.\n\nBesides, I could not give a flying f\\*\\*k on how they physically depict male characters as I am not interested in men.\n\n>if you weren't such a soy boy yourself.\n\nThis is coming from someone who is majorly concerned about his handsome steroid-abusing six pack Chad characters being supposedly \"censored\" and/or \"uglified\".",
