    "post_text ": "Recently, the FCC announced its proposed rollback of [net neutrality rules.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rz4Ej3IVefo) The gaming community has good reasons to consider this move a threat. Gamers are especially vulnerable to ISPs for two reasons:\n\n1. we depend on high quality Internet access.\n2. we spend money.\n\nThe second one is the biggest reason to worry. ISPs' primary motivation for gutting net neutrality rules to extract more revenue both from *us* (for high quality service that should be standard) *and* the companies we're trying to access. The PC gaming market grew to $36 billion in 2016, with F2P games like League of Legends, World of Tanks, and DOTA 2 [leading the charge](http://www.pcgamer.com/pc-gaming-market-worth-36-billion-in-2016/). \n\nThe New York Attorney General is suing Time Warner Cable right now for [interfering with both Netflix *and* League of Legends players](http://www.polygon.com/2017/2/9/14548880/time-warner-lawsuit-new-york-league-of-legends-netflix). Riot provided data on latency and packet loss for the lawsuit, which is pretty damning, [you can read it here](https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/summons_and_complaint.pdf). It wasn't just incompetence on TWC's part. TWC was deliberately allowing failure while they were pressuring Riot Games for a payment.\n\nAnother thing to consider is how much data games use. Many modern games are over 50GB in size. Not even counting online gaming, game downloads must count for a sizable chunk of internet traffic. ISPs could charge fast lane fees to companies like Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, and Valve, which would drive up the cost of games and services. In a world without net neutrality, we’ll see shallower discounts, and $70 or $80 games if ISPs get their way.\n\nIf we lose net neutrality, whenever you open our wallet online, ISPs will want a piece, and there will be little or nothing you can do about it. But we can stop this. FCC Chair Ajit Pai can ignore the public, But it’s much harder for him to ignore Congress. That’s why the most important thing you can do right now is [email](https://battleforthenet.com) and [call](https://battleforthenet.com/call) your Senators and House reps, and tell them to oppose Ajit Pai's reconfirmation, and [send a comment to the FCC in support of Net Neutrality](https://battleforthenet.com/). \n\nBut perhaps **more than anything** we need a team who can help us organize gamers, and the industry as a whole to fight back. If you can help PM me!\n\nIf you're confused about what's going on, or need a quick refresher, here is a great video from John Oliver: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92vuuZt7wak",

            "Reply_Text": "On May 16, 2018, Robert moved to a new city. He was excited to start his new job, and lay down roots in the community. He wasn't worried about losing connections to his old friends, because Robert would play games with them every thursday night. Robert arrived at his new house and called the only ISP that services his house, \"BIG ISP Co.\" They sent a technician the next day to set up his Internet service.\n\n\"Okay, I've got your modem plugged in, now I just need to know what services you use.\" The tech looked down at his tablet and cleared his throat, preparing to read from a list. \"Just stop me when you hear a service you would like to use.\" He began to read, \"BIG Movies, BIG Music, BIG Storage.\"\n\n\"No, I don't use those, I didn't have BIG Internet at my last house.\" Robert replied, \"I think it would be faster if I just gave you a list of what I plan to use.\"\n\n\"That might be a problem, especially if your services don't fit in a BIG Internet bundle we already offer.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Well, do you watch movies online from services like Netflix and Amazon Prime?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course I do.\"\n\n\"Okay, we'll add the streaming movies package.\" The tech checked off a box, and the monthly price for Robert's quote got higher at the bottom of the his tablet. \"What about television, do you catch up on missed episodes online?\n\n\"Yes, of course! I can't be around all the time when shows are on!\"\n\n\"No problem. I'll add the streaming television package too.\" The tech checked another box, and Robert's quote got higher again. \"How about music, you said you don't use BIG Music, do you want to listen to another internet radio service?\"\n\n\"I have a ton of Spotify playlists! Pretty much one for every occasion.\"\n\n\"Okay, we'll need to add the Music Streaming package, then.\" Another box checked, another increase to Robert's monthly subscription cost. \"Now, how about games, do you use BIG Games to play with friends?\"\n\n\"No, I connect with friends using Discord, and we play all sort of games.\"\n\n\"Discord, huh? VOIP service too, then.\" The tech scrolled through his list looking for VOIP services. He checked the box, and the quote got higher. \"You play games from Steam?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Origin?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"GoG?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWith each \"yes,\" the price of Robert's monthly fee went up.\n\n\"Guild Wars?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Battle.net?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Star Citizen?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Candy Crush?\"\n\n\"No. I don't play Candy Crush.\"\n\n\"Great, you're going to love the savings of not paying for Facebook games.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure about that.\" Robert looked at the tablet. The long list of third party services had come with service charges that ballooned his rate to twice what he expected to pay. \"My last service provider didn't charge me extra to use Netflix or Spotify or Steam. This seems like a racket!\"\n\n\"Well, sir, you're welcome to use a competitor, then. LARGENET services the other side of town. I think their service charges are pretty much the same, so if you care about it so much, you're welcome to move. I won't keep you here.\"\n\n\"That's it, I can pay your fees or move?! Those are my only options?\" Robert was incredulous. \"This can't be legal!\"\n\n\"Completely legal, sir. Net Neutrality is a thing of the past. I am a BIG ISP Co shareholder, and I would be furious if they weren't making all the money they could. LARGENET does it. GIANT CONNECT does it. We have to do it to compete!\"\n\n\"Fine\" Robert said, \"lets just sign this thing.\"\n\n\"Hold your horses, Cowboy\" The technician guffawed at the idea that he was finished. \"We haven't even talked about your data cap yet.\"",

Just to balance it out a little bit - in Poland, where I live, I pay around $25 for 150/15 cable and I live in the centre of a big 700k population city. I don't have alternatives and even though fiber is laying under most streets getting it connected to your apartment building is a pain and a half because you have to get a lot of people to split the cost. Otherwise it is just very expensive to do it by yourself.\n\nSome people in other areas have it even worse if they only have access to small, privately owned ISPs. They can often only get sub 20 mbit and pay pretty much the same money that I do or more.\n\nThankfully pretty much all new developments that get built(and there's a fuckton of them lately) are getting connected to either fiber or a very fast cable connection straight away so there's progress in that area at least.",

How about any loans you took out yourself? Did they, will they, are are they delaying or preventing you from buying a home? Will you be renting until they day you die? With a university education paid for through taxes, this wouldn't be a problem. Not just for you, but for everyone else in your family, your extended family, your city, your state, and your country. The benefits from this are almost immeasurable.\n\nHow about healthcare? Do you know anyone who went into bankruptcy because of medical debt? Are you related to anyone who had to fork over an unhealthy amount of money to pay medical bills? How about a family member who had to borrow money to pay for them?\n\nWhat about friends? What about your customers? Their friends? Their families? What about you being chained to your job for the rest of your life because you need health insurance? Sure, you get it, but your life is not yours. Every choice you make until you retire will be weighed against your health insurance.\n\nWhat about if you lose your job? What if it takes a few months to get a new one? What if you *can't*?\n\nWhat if?\nWhat if?\n*What if?*\n\nWhat if you had an idea and you wanted to run with it and see if you could turn it into a career?

It should be an embarrassment that we have the largest prison population in the world. It should be an embarrassment that we have some of the worst wealth inequality in the world. Stop with this Murica bullshit and smell the coffee.",

The ISP was about four blocks away but there was some weird thing about there being no conduit running under ground across one street and that street was between us and the ISP (and the city wouldn't let them run above ground wiring). We had a directional antenna on the roof pointed at the antenna on the ISP's roof. It was horribly kludgy but it worked.\n\nI have no idea if the conduit excuse was real, I inherited managing the pre-existing wireless setup. It worked though, so I guess I can't complain.",

Ping is fine though, and its a dedicated line so you dont hit those \"peak usage\" slowdowns.\n\nI think its a big missed market with how many people are upset at their cable providers internet packages, if some company could start offering DSL with reasonable bandwidth in those markets where timewarner and comcast are the only options, theyd make a killing I'm sure.",

Single payer systems don't mean nobody can invent a better bedpan or make money selling it to institutions.  Likewise, not having a bunch of corporate players with >30% spending on marketing in the middle doesn't mean nobody can invent a better packet switcher or develop a new method of laying lines.  I don't even think AT&T does theoretical science anymore, and they were one of the last corporate entities in the U.S. to engage in such research.\n\nBrand competition and marketing are drains, not assets, and surely not sources of new ideas that make life better for human beings.  Making most of our working musicians write jingles is not the optimal way to organize human endeavor.  None of this has anything at all to do with the real innovations.  If anything corporate competition in the telecommunications sector fubars regulation while simultaneously diverting resources into redundant projects.",

Sort of like \"socialized losses, privatized profits\".\n\nIt puts us in a position were either moving to a utility model or a free market would improve the situation.\n\nPersonally, I believe altering the regs to foster actual competition would have the best outcome. If everyone at every level of the Internet infrastructure had four providers to choose from, we'd have the best and cheapest Internet in the world. With the bonus of the market automatically responding to changes instead of waiting for regs to catch up.\n\nBut, either way is an improvement. I'll take what I can get.",

It would be a hellscape for urban planners.  Connectivity is a little bit like that.  Also, big corporations will always be able to muscle town governments, stifling competition in markets too small to justify the struggle.

I don't see upholding NN and favoring ISP competition at odds. I think people *correctly* see a problem with the service. I think they *incorrectly* see upholding NN as the key to improving service. I don't necessarily think NN will make internet service worse. It may not. But I don't think it will help either, and it may have unintended negative consequences. I fail to see how NN does anything to break up monopolies either. It simply lays rules on how the existing monopolies must act.\n\nWhich again, isn't *necessarily* a bad thing. But it isn't *necessarily* a good thing either. I see NN largely as a red herring.

Your opponent is approaching this from the infrastructure angle and that the basic infrastructure *should* be government managed. The actual service provision can be handled by ISPs. The issue is when ISPs have control over both infrastructure and service, they basically neglect the areas which are not as profitable for them whilst continuing to charge them significant amounts of money for the same shitty service being provided. By contrast, the cities get far better service due to greater presence of a market and profit from a good service being better.\n\nNow, I agree that opening up the US internet market to full competition instead of the protectionist measures undertaken by the government currently would benefit the customers overall, but its more than likely that many of the customers not living in the cities will continue to see shitty substandard service because private companies have no incentive to invest in a market that is unlikely to make them any profit.",

I've used my mobile data plan as my sole internet source for over a year now. I live in a small town so 3G works great, even for gaming(50-70 ping in CSGO. Not great, but sufficable) I use around 160-170gbs of data monthly so if ISPs started implementing mobile data caps widely, it would really set me back economically.

People still pay $100+ for cable, after all. They won't increase their price all at once, they will add \"features\" and charge extra for things you were already getting for free.\n\nDid you ever have an unlimited cell phone data plan in the US? They got rid of those by offering cheaper plans that had data limits and then just didn't let you go back to true unlimited. I think some companies do have true unlimited again, but it's been over 10 years before they deemed that profitable again.",

This is now the third or fourth time the big ISP's in the US have tried to do this in the last 10 years.\n\nThe worst thing of the last couple years, the FCC [allowed Centurylink to purchase with Level 3](http://news.level3.com/news-archive?item=65568) the TLDR on that is that Level 3 used to charge companies like Valve, Netflix, Microsoft, EA, etc...  to provide content 'upstream' to users, where as Centurylink charges users to bring data 'downstream' from providers. With this purchase now Centurylink has the rights to charge on both ends of the stream, you pay them to get data, and companies pay them to provide data. This is terrible, as they can just go and say 'hey Valve, you're late on your payments, ALL data going through our system is going to get throttled until you pay your extra value premium', AND they can charge you for downloading from Steam because 'hey that steam stuff is high bandwidth, and causes extra use on our system' Then, on top of all that they can give you a nice 'hey you gotta pay extra because that Steam download pushed you over your data cap'.\n\nBefore you think this is not going to happen, [it already is](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/03/netflix-says-it-will-pay-tolls-to-more-isps-not-just-comcast/)",

That's not how data works. It all depends on the infrastructure between A and B. Yes, you can load down hops along the way, but this should not be fixed by segregating/prioritizing traffic, it should be fixed by upgrading infrastructure.\n\nThink of it this way. Have you ever been to Disneland/Disneyworld? If yes, have you ever seen the FastPass option? These are priority ticket sales, and Disney is pushing these options quite a lot lately, they're free, and you get to 'skip the line' however, due to the rise in popularity, you now have the option of either waiting 1 hour in the normal line, or 55 minutes in the fast pass line. Pretty soon, with the way things are going, you'll have a 55 minute wait in the normal line, and 1 hour in the 'fast pass' line... This is what Net Neutrality is meant to prevent.\n\nAnd, yes, this does happen. Once someone finds out they can pay for 'better' service, they will pay for it, then, that 'better service' will suddenly be the average service, the previous average service will become the slow service, and the old slow service will be slowly phased out, and a newer, faster, more expensive 'priority/better' service will become available.\n\n5 year ago, 50Mb/s was $50/month, and other speeds were cheaper and slower but available. than the 'premium' speed was 100Mb/s and it was $70/month, the 50 was still around, but it was usually around 40Mb/s because more of the traffic was allocated to the 100Mb/s. Once people started complaining that the 100 was only 80Mb/s, they introduced the 150Mb/s plan, this was $90/month. That was a year ago, it's currently averaging around 140Mb/s (I have the 150Mb/s plan), I know that my ISP is working on a 250Mb/s plan, as they offer it to the company I work for, and it will be rolling out to residential plans next year. This is Canada, where net neutrality is still a thing, but ISP's still find ways to get around that by simply 1 upping their own plans, allowing the previous ones to become unusable. the 50Mb/s plan now averages around 10-15Mb/s during 'peak hours' and the ISP response is generally 'sorry, to many people torrenting'... And yet other people in the neighborhood are getting 80-140Mb/s just fine, depending on the service they're paying for.\n\nThe only 'segregation' that I'm OK with is emergency # call priority (911/999/whathaveyou). And I'm only ok with this because it's a potential life saving 'segregation' allowing people in emergency to have a priority line. Anything else is just BS.",

And to double dip, they're charging Netflix just to reach their customers.\nAnd companies like Comcast also own content (NBC). So they can provide free, unhindered access to their own content. (which would incentivize people away from using a competitor.)\n\nNow, ISPs will say that this will allow them to charge a premium and provide improved service to those that want it.\nBut what it really means is that you will have to pay extra just to maintain the service you have today. Otherwise, you're network connection will have a lower priority to them.

It's a dumb move that hurts more than it helps.  Jobs are worth what jobs are worth in the free market, you can't artificially inflate that value; all it does is push the cost off to the consumer and destroys small businesses...it create all sorts of problems like increased unemployment, health care shortages, housing issues, etc.\n\n>higher taxes on the rich\n\nAlso reduced job creation and stagnates growth.  The benefit of high taxes on the rich, when you actually run the numbers, is not at all impressive.  Take a look at Europe's economy, it's decidedly mediocre and stagnant.\n\n>net neutrality\n\nDemocrats aren't for Net Neutrality, their sponsors are (Google, Facebook, Netflix, etc).  Their sponsors aren't for net neutrality for the *people*, they are for net neutrality become it will cost them income.  The only people *for* net neutrality are people, not politicians or corporations.\n\nIf you don't think this is true, look at how Democrats are perfectly fine with Google and Facebook collecting and selling your data but not ISPs.\n\n>civil rights, voting rights\n\nNeither of which are challenged by modern Republicans nor have they been in 40 years.  Unless your talking about non-US citizens voting, which many democrats support, and is wildly illegal.  The only thing I've ever seen Republicans do is to want to verify that people *are* citizens, which is something damn near every other country in the world does.\n\n>LGBT rights\n\nTrump was the only President who publicly came out for gays.  Only a subsection of the religious right actually cares anymore.\n\nhttp://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/nov/2/donald-trump-holds-high-flag-gay-equality/\n\n>acknowledging climate change is real\n\nAnd pretending biology isn't.  Let us not pretend Democrats are the \"science\" party, cause that's completely full of shit and ignores a lot of the garbage being spewed out of liberally dominated social science and liberal arts departments.  For fuck sake, you turned these departments into the same sort of brainwashing political garbage that republicans did with Churches.\n\n>feel free to dump them\n\nParties aren't black and white.

I hope nobody is stupid enough to simply ask a kid about that and be done with it.\n\n>I still don't quite understand how a transgendered person can \"feel\" like another gender, without ever having known what it is like to be that gender.\nFeel something's not right, sure, but how do you know what it feels like to be a woman on the inside?\n\nIt usually starts with people feeling like something is not right, and then throughout the years and learning the societal standards for both genders etc etc. they can put a finger on the 'wrong feeling' they have. At least that is how I understand that. I talked with some trans people but I can't say that I prodded enough at it to have te perfect understanding of the process.\nBut it seems reasonable to me to assume that, with time and experience, they will see in what things and spheres of life they are naturally inclined to act contrary to the standards expected from their gender.",

Does a geologist have a say when speaking about biology or physics?\n\nAnecdotal I know, but I think there are two major genders (XX, XY) with some genetic mutations (Kleinfelter syndrome, Turner syndrome) withstanding. For you to tell me that there is a 'scientific consensus' that there is more than two (mutations apart) biological genders, I will need a scientific study that has been peer reviewed. With climate change I believe that the climate is changing mainly in part due to humanity's insistence on pumping CO2 into the ozone layer. As for believing in creationism? You couldn't pay me enough to go along with that fairy tale.\n\nSo please, tell me in your infinite wisdom of how I know nothing about of what I speak and how you are the one true speaker for all of science.",

Gender is a linguistic, sociological, and psychological concept. It's exclusively the domain of the social sciences, and maybe to a limited extent neurology. There *is* such a thing as biological sex, and you're correct that there's basically two of those, plus some rare oddballs that aren't considered sexes in their own right, but that's completely irrelevant to the issue at hand.\n\nWhen the International Astronomer's Union declared that Pluto was no longer a planet, was it because they'd suddenly discovered new information about Pluto? Of course not. It was because they decided that the definition of \"planet\" they'd been working with was no longer useful, and they were going to come up with a new one. At the end of the day, \"sex\" and \"planet\" are just words. They're useful words, but assuming that because biologists only think there's two sexes worth keeping track of there must only be two genders is like thinking that because Pluto is no longer a planet, it must not exist.",

The FCC chairman is crooked as hell and I just don't think Republicans understand the ramifications. ISPs are telling them this is the pro-business move and leaving out the fact that it is only pro-ISP. I think they are so anti-Obama and anti-Democrat that if the Democrats want it and ISPs are telling them net neutrality is anti-business, that is enough for them to make up their minds.",

They're doing a great job so far and uncovering a lot of very sketchy stuff. You should try cracking open a newspaper. But maybe you'd like to start with a book to help you learn how to read. I suggest the Hungry Caterpillar. It really helped me when I was a toddler. I'm sure you can handle it.\n\n>marching for women's rights that women already have had for 50 years\n\nYou mean the ones that are under threat, explicitly, every time Republicans get a whiff of power?\n\nThose rights?\n\nJust like Democrats are still fighting to preserve the rights of minorities and poor people to vote even though that should have been settled 60 years ago during the Civil Rights era. Because Republicans have overturned voting rights protections and have been found by multiple courts to have targeted the rights of minorities to vote in elections.\n\nYeah. Democrats sure are obsessed with protecting the rights of people who are constantly having their rights threatened by Republicans. How dare they?",

Those are my only options?\" Robert was incredulous. \"This can't be legal!\"\n\nNo.\n\nYour best option is to stop playing games.  I know this is an unpopular opinion here - this thread turned up on all, so I decided to look.\n\nI played computer and console games when I was a kid.  Then puberty hit and I lost interest.  That was 1985.  I'll look through the game section at the store now and then.  Nothing appeals to me.  Nothing.  And I don't think I'm missing out.\n\nWhen a company pisses me off, they stop getting my money.  I don't care if it is a service I like, I am not going to pay for bad corporate behavior.  Which is why you should vote with your feet and your wallet.  Turn it off.\n\nThis is why I cut the cord back in 1999.  There were TV shows I loved.  But fuck cable companies.  I learned to live without.  I am better off for it, as well.  I became a lot more productive since I stopped watching TV and, again, I don't think I missed anything important.\n\nI've been amazed at how much time people put into videogames.  What do you get out of it?  I saw a guy on Reddit who claimed to have several thousand hours into one particular game.\n\nI did a rough calculation of how many hours I put into law school and passing the bar.  This guy had more hours into a game than it took me to become a lawyer.  Not just a little bit, like a couple thousand hours more.\n\nAnd for what?  I'm a lawyer.  He's, what, a level 70 elf?\n\nSeriously, folks.  Forget the games.  They're a waste of life.  Put those hours into *yourself.*  Games aren't worth it.  And fuck the ISPs if they want to charge more.  Don't give them the money.  Put it into yourself.  Don't throw away your money and your life on a game.  That's bullshit.\n\nGo ahead and start downvoting, folks.  Or maybe you should stop wasting your life doing nothing and do something you can be proud of.",

My only gripe is bandwidth, but my bandwidth is reasonable. But the upcoming situation with NN gone is a huge net loss to me. I'll be paying more for less at best, and at worst there will be no \"complete internet\" package.\n\nAnd seriously, what am I going to do in the meantime before a new business sets up in my area? Utility markets don't disrupt overnight. It may seriously be a decade or more before the ISP market budges, if it even does at all for the majority of areas.",
