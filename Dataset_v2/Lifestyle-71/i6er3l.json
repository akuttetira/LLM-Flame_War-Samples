Came back from vacation to find my foster kittens in terrible condition and one dead. Everyone yelled at me for my reaction",
    "post_text ": "I knew this was a mistake. I regret going. \n\nI was fostering kittens for several weeks when nmom wanted me to go on vacation with her, my sister, and my niece. Nmom told me the kittens would be fine. I didn't believe her, butThey are now near death, and one of them was deceased. The deceased kitten had been there for a while. You could tell it wasn't a recent death. I started hyperventilating when I saw what condition they were in.\n\nHe lied to us everyday and said the kittens were fine. We left him tons of food for them and litter. He had the resources, but he didn't use them. He's a 30 year old man.\n\nHe denied ALL accountability despite them being incredibly thin and covered in feces. He yelled at me and my family took his side, saying he did his best. They said I was being irrational and crazy by hyperventilating. I wasn't able to say much at the moment, I felt like I couldn't breathe.\n\nMy family reacted to my reaction by saying \"It's not all about you. You act like this is all about YOU. We aren't going to pander to you they are CATS.  You're upsetting your niece and acting like a crazy person.\"\n\nMy 10 year old niece wasn't even in the room, but they used that to justify screaming at me and told me I was a drama queen and a psycho for crying. \n\nI started off sad, but when they started to shift the blame to me I was furious. I told them I want to estrange from everyone and my sister was like \"And where will you go? You're not going to do that.\" I told them I wasn't going to keep what happened a secret. \n\nI'm reporting my brother for animal neglect, because this isn't a one time incident. There were similar incidents that nmom promised would \"never happen again.\" My family is furious at me and says I'm going to ruin everyone's lives by reporting my brother. \n\nThe kittens were around 8 weeks old when we went on vacation. Healthy, fat, great condition. When I got back, they were emaciated and dirty and one was dead.\n\nPlease tell me I'm not the crazy one. I feel like I am.",
