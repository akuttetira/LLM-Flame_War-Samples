    "post_text ": "This is what social distancing with an only child looks like right now.  I usually let him play out back for a few minutes at a time since our backyard is fenced, but I check on him often.  During a few minute stretch, he decided to pull down his pants and poop in the backyard like our dog.  He ran inside to proudly tell me what he had done.  I immediately told him how inappropriate that was and to show me where so I could clean up the mess.  By the time we got to where he had pooped, our dog had already eaten it.  That’s it.  I’m done for today.",
