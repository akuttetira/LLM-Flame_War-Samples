    "Post_Title": "Likely final update: Husband wants to divorce/\"start over,\" he \"can't bond\" with daughter",
    "post_text ": "This is probably going to be long and it isn't a happy update. \n\nMy other posts can be seen in my post history but the short of it is that I (30NB) gave birth to my daughter in September. My STBX husband (29M) did not see her birth; things went very badly and I needed emergency intervention. He was not in the room for the C-Section. About a month and a half ago he informed me that he \"cannot bond with her because he did not see her be born\" and he \"wants to divorce so he can start over on his dreams of a close-knit family.\"\n\nWe have filed. I have taken Daughter and moved back in with my parents, who aren't very happy about the divorce but are thrilled to \"have the chance to nanny\" Daughter (their words, not mine!)\n\nLife was in stasis for about a week after my last post until FIL asked us to come over for dinner. He informed me that STBX had asked for his help paying for a lawyer. He had agreed with the requirement that we all sit down and have one last talk about the situation. He opened with saying that he thinks that \"getting this over with\" would be best for me and Daughter (STBX looked a little hurt at this) so he's willing to help but he wanted to take one last shot at fixing it. The one last shot ended up being several hours of talking. \n\nFIL bluntly demanded that STBX explain his reasoning. STBX repeated the can't bond thing, FIL asked why. The \"employment contract\" analogy was brought up again. After much back, forth, what do you mean by this, why that...FIL just said \"I'm not buying this. What's the real reason, STBX?\" \n\nSTBX insisted til the end that what he'd been saying all along was his reasoning. He did not see Daughter be born so he can't bond. He tried, he insisted. The connection isn't there. He was supposed to connect when Daughter was born, there \"was supposed to be a spark of connection between them\" but that spark can only happen right at birth I guess? In his mind he can't get it now. \n\nFIL asked if STBX thought Daughter wasn't his. STBX insists he has no doubts he is Daughter's biological father. \n\nFIL asked if STBX was seeing someone else. Was there a woman or another pregnancy somewhere? STBX did not react well to this. He threw his phone down on the table and said that we were free to search it; he's not a scumbag. \n\nAfter that the conversation turned to post-divorce life. STBX offered up that he'd been running the numbers and would volunteer 50/month alimony and 50/month in child support. He doesn't *have to* do either, mind, because we're divorcing and he wants to cut all ties with the kid, but he wants to be fair. \n\n$50 in alimony? Whatever, I have a job and a roof over our heads. I don't need it. $50 dollars in child support? That is alot less whatever. But I'm refusing to stress about it. The court will handle CS amounts. I'm making myself not be angry and let them deal with it. \n\nI admit I tuned out most of the rest of FIL's attempt to talk sense into his son after that comment. I think that was when the coffin finally nailed itself shut. I started packing when we got home and went to my parents' house the next day. I'm no longer talking to STBX, his lawyer talks to mine. We haven't spoken in almost 3 weeks. I don't think I need to tell you that he hasn't shown any concern for Daughter but here I am anyway. \n\nThe day after I got there my sister kidnapped me to her place. We got very drunk (Daughter was with parents, not us!) talked about everything and I screamed alot. I got most of it out of my system. After that we had more drinks and watched terrible horror movies. I woke up the next day with the headache from hell but otherwise feeling better than I had in a long time. \n\nMy job can't transfer me, just my luck, but I've been promised a glowing reference and I'm cashing out what little paid leave I have left to add to my savings. FIL asked after the failed conversation if I would be cutting *him* off. I assured him that he might not see us as much because of how far away my parents live and not knowing where I'll end up but he's not getting rid of me or Daughter that easily. He was very happy to hear that. \n\nSo that's where I am. Papers have been filed, Daughter and I have moved out of the house, I'm doing my best to ignore STBX's existence. Thank you all again for listening to me cry and complain over the past couple months.",

I'm so sorry you're going through this!\n\nAlso hard lol to \"I don't HAVE to do anything because I'm divorcing you and cutting ties with my child, but out of the goodness of my heart I'll give you $50 a month.\"\n\nI know you can support yourself and your child on your own, but your child deserves every penny the courts award. You are 100% correct to let the lawyers handle this from here, and tell'em to get everything they can.",

Men all over the world miss the birth of their kids for multiple reasons. They don't spout bullshit about some spark that apparently only happens if you watch the kid leave the mother's body. The whole \"spark\" thing makes me wonder what his excuse would have been if he had seen it and not felt it, because after such a huge ordeal going through labour, there's not always a \"spark\". Relief, happiness, lots of things, but not always this immediate spark of love and bonding.",

I remember joking that he must have imprinted on Husband like a baby duck because they were best buddies from the beginning. I didn't feel a bond with Son for a solid month and I felt so broken. I wish people talked about this more, because I have since learned that it's common and not at all a reason to feel like a failure at being a mom (like I did, which didn't help the PPD I struggled with).",

He just leaves behind kids with a shitty deadbeat dad because he can't be arsed putting in the work to create a tight-knit family.\n\nBecause even if you do feel that spark immediately, that's not a guarantee of a perfect family.

Even if you sign away your rights to visit or make choices on their upbringing, you cannot sign away your responsibility to ensure they have their basic needs taken care of (i.e. pay child support). Only if they are no longer their legal parent (as you mentioned, adoption) are they absolved of their financial responsibilities. Otherwise, every deadbeat parent would just sign away their rights/responsibilities and leave the State or the remaining parent holding the bill.\n\n\nAdditionally, if a parent ever files for social assistance, the State WILL file for child support on their behalf, regardless of whatever \"contract\" is signed between parents. You cannot sign away a child's right to be supported financially, and the State will make you participate financially even if you don't want to.",

On what planet does watching someone else give birth help a person bond with the child being born?\n\nEither STBX is mentally ill, or a liar, or an alien... Or he simply does not know what the word \"bond\" means and is also confused about what the role of a parent is. A lot of people don't really like newborns. That's not really the point of being a father.\n\nI hope we get an update on STBX's jaw hitting the floor when he realizes that he can't just decide for himself what amount of child support is fair. OP is better off without this fucker. He seems... delusional.",
