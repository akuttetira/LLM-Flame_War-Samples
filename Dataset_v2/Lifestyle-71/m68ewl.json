And I found them. I put everything back exactly where it was and took these documents back in my room. I'm trying to find a good spot for them but holy shit I did it. This is a huge step in the right direction. I'm one step closer to leaving this hell hole.\n\nEdit: Wow thank you all for the karma and support! I also really appreciate all the advice I've been given. This community is amazing. ♥",
