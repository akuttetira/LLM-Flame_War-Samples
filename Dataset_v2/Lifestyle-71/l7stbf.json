    "post_text ": "Can't believe I even have to write this.\n\nFor years my mom had this weird \"joke\" of touching my behind. She likes to pinch it, go with her fingers up my exposed legs, or \"tickle me on the insight of my legs near my crotch. She did this for years and for years I hated this, but she always told me \"oh, my mother used to do this\", or \"you're my child, I can do this\", or \"I'm your mother. Calm down, it's nothing sexual.\"\n\nWell, today I had enough. When she tried to tickle me, I slapped her hand away and told her off. Told her straight that I don't want to be touched there. She responded the same comments, but I said \"no. I don't want to be touched. I have a right to not get touched if I don't want to.\"\n\nShe probably didn't learn her lesson, but I still am kinda proud of myself. As you read, I currently have to endure her \"pouting season\" rn. In the next time, I'll have to put up with random aggressions, mocking jokes and dramatic acts, when I'll accidentally run into her.\n\nI don't care though.\n\n_Edit_ :So first of all, thanks for all the kind words! I really didn't think a lot about my progression, but apparently it struck a nerve with people.\n\nHowever, just to clear a few things up a bit:\n\n1. A lot of people seem to believe I'm a guy and that I still go to school. No, I am a girl and  go to university. However, even when I told teachers when I was still at school they either didn't believe me, or brushed it off as me overreacting.\n\n2. No, I sadly can't call CPS. Long story short; I'm from a place where CPS is rather lazy. Being 18yo most people believe I can \"just move out\" and in general I'm from a culture where people tend to stick to their own problems. And even if they'd help me, my mother is pretty good at lying to people\n\n3. She's not a paedophile, but definitely fucked up. She has a lot of crooked ideas around sexuality like f.ex  thinking cheating is natural and everyone who denies doing it, simply lies about it",
