    "post_text ": "When I was growing up, “I need to talk to you” quite literally meant impending doom. It quite literally meant that I was going to walk into a room, have a screaming battle for 30 minutes, cry, and want to commit suicide, over and over again. I have PTSD from it all. \n\nMy boyfriends mom, every other day, comes to us and says “I need to talk to you guys *later*” and it makes me live in anxiety now. And it’s almost always something trivial that could have been said in passing. \n\nGod, please just say it in passing. Don’t say that we need to talk *later* and then have it be something that you could’ve just said right then in there. I really hate going through the whole day in anxiety like that.",

I’d never say things to someone and deliberately try to trigger their anxiety, as it’s just another way of them having control over you.",

I highly doubt she actually means me any harm. And I have so far not spilled the beans that I have PTSD, and when she says these things, that it gives me anxiety.\n\n> It’s fucking cruel\n\nYou are absolutely right. If it were a narcissist doing this, I’d resonate with this comment completely. My narcissist father is the reason I feel this way, and again, I don’t think she knows.\n\nHere’s the deal. She makes LISTS and NOTES of what she wants to talk to us about so she doesn’t forget. waits till they add up a bit, then says “we need to talk later.” It drives me absolutely insane.\n\nBut i’m living under her roof, by the grace of her, because my own family is abusive. So i don’t want to do anything that could cause any friction between us. And Ibdont want to step on her toes. That’s why i’m afraid to bring up the idea of asking her to change something about herself that is likely just a force of habit.",

Tell her you appreciate her, give her bad news, then follow up with more appreciation.\n\nEven suggestions such as \"I made some notes for later\" or \"I have a list so I didn't forget\" could say the same thing without triggering you in an intense way.

It was the same for me growing up, and my Nmother and I have fought over the phone/text so many times I also have anxiety about getting a text or call, or even notifications sometimes. It's super draining and brutal. Sometimes I have to ignore all texts/calls/messages for days at a time before I feel okay about it again. Luckily my friends are aware of this and are supportive.\n\nAnd getting into the whole \"I have anxiety. No, actual anxiety that greatly impacts my day-to-day and overall quality of life,\" is so shitty and frustrating. It might help if you just let her know that it's making you uncomfortable. Maybe you won't have to deal with all the explaining BS. Another thing that helps me is repeating to myself that they're not my Nparent, they're my BFs amazing mom. That I'm out of that situation and I don't need to be afraid or hyper-aware anymore. That my BFs mom is different and doesn't deserve to be perceived the same as my Nparent. Obviously that is the tricky part. If we could all think our way out if anxiety it wouldn't be a problem, but I find the repetition finally helps drill it home, and over time it's easier for me to calm myself and not associate others with my Nparent.\n\nI hope she listens easily and everything is resolved without much fuss.

Do what you feel like.\" I've heard that phrase before and know what it means. It's burned me before. I admit, my response was a touch harsh, but things finally came to a head. We went on a cruise recently (right before things went sideways) and my younger brother (26 year old) didn't want to go. Which, if you're not going to enjoy it, why let someone waste the money on a ticket (she paid most of our fares).\n\nShe whined and bitched and moaned all week because he didn't want to be there with the family. The WHOLE FUCKING WEEK. and I guarantee she gave him the same passive aggressive bullshit to convince him to\"make the right choice\".",

I recently told my boss how much anxiety the \"we need to talk\" comment gives me. 99% of the time it's nothing to worry about, but I spend the interim worried I'm getting fired or something even though I know that they like my work (and would get a chance to improve if they didn't). Since I told her, my boss has changed how she says this. Instead of saying, \"please schedule a meeting with me for tomorrow\" she'll now say, \"please schedule a meeting with me tomorrow to discuss this year's conference schedule\" or whatever. This small change has made such a difference in my work life.\n\nHow is your relationship with your boyfriend's mom? Good enough that you would feel comfortable talking to her about how this is a problem for you? If this phrase isn't an issue for her, there is a good chance that your kind of reaction has never occurred as a possibility to her.\n\nI really encourage you to ask her to stop doing this. It doesn't have to be confrontational. You don't have to reveal your whole history. You can say, \"I know it might feel like a small thing, but when you tell me that you want to talk to me later without telling what you want to talk about it really gives me anxiety and I'd appreciate if you'd either tell me the thing in the moment or tell me what the topic for later it. It would stop my imagination and anxiety from going into overdrive.\"",

Or I’ll ask them what it’s about for some clarification.\n\nWhen do people say this to you? It might help reminding yourself that most things that require a conversation need to be saved for when you actually have time, and maybe they’re asking because they *know* they don’t have the time right now, but don’t want to forget later.\n\nEither way, it’s totally reasonable to ask them to clarify and at least let you know what the conversation will be about. I hate when people make a big deal out of it and like you said, follow it up with something small that could’ve been said without all that.",

We are on decent terms though I only see him every few years. Mom never apologized, but she’s also changed for the positive as a person. I keep her at a distance as well, but I’m glad I things have changed. I chose to never be a father because of how I was brought up, and I believe it was the best choice for me (I do have a daughter I met when she was a teen and we are good friends).",

I rarely show emotion in my professional life let alone personal life, but my normal life anxiety is anywhere from 5-7/10.\n\nI had to have a frank conversation with her because on a particularly high-anxiety day where this particular phrase had me on the verge of a breakdown... she slips sometimes, but rarely uses those exact words anymore.

I know how much anxiety I had to go through till I could safely get away for a few minutes to make the call. A lot of people don't actually understand this and it can be hard for them to empathise with our situations. And it's hard for us to explain WHY we feel so anxious. But it's not something I can control. It took him a while to understand that and when he finally did, he was so apologetic and never did it again.",
