    "post_text ": "My mom doesn't like that I masturbate and she wants me infibulated so I don't have sex/unable to masturbate. \n\nI read on Washington's laws and they say I'm not protected and that my mom can have it performed on me. There's nothing to protect me from my mother forcing this on me if she wants it.\n\nMy mom pulled me out of school temporarily and now I'm afraid she means it.\n\nMy mom says we're going to the clinic for me to be infibulated in two days. My mom says I have to comply because she is my parent and I can't say no or resist. She says my infibulation and clitoris removal will be done under anesthetic and while I'm unconscious. The person infibulating me is a former doctor, but not an active one. She's planning to have the clinic he used to own cover it up. I'm also Caucasian so is my mom, so she can't take me out of country.\n\nI tried posting on r/legaladvice but my post got deleted in two hours.\n\nPlease tell me what I can do, my mom took my phone away so I can't call or text cps or police.",

Other teens in your area might be able to get you out, if legal resources aren't helpful. A locked window is only as good as the rock used to break it. You absolutely can get out. Running away isn't the best advice, there's plenty of better advice on this thread, but this sub is one more resource for you to explore if all else fails.\n\nIf you need a silver lining, also consider that if she goes through with this, then you can file a lawsuit against her, the doctor, and the clinic, after you turn 18. I learned about this due to the nature of my own work. I believe you have until you are 21 to file a lawsuit for harm done to you as a minor. I'm not a lawyer, but you'll need to consult one to file the suit anyway.\n\nFor goodness sake though, please do everything you can to get out of this situation. Don't believe her when she says you can't run away. She's been lying to you your entire life. Get out of that house and tell an adult what's going on. Teachers, in particular, are suited to help you.",
