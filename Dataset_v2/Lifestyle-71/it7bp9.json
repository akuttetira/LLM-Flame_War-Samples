    "post_text ": "This is my first post here, I've been a long time lurker though. English is not my first or second language, so if I make any mistakes, sorry in advance.  \n\n\nOnto the post.   \nMy parents were the popular type in highschool. They had a lot of friends and never did anything during class, so naturally they failed their classes.   \nThen they had me. I'm introverted and quiet. The 'good student' type. Lately, due to stress for my exams and all that, school isn't going as good for me as it used to. My Ndad, however, keeps complaining to me about my grades, while I'm trying my very best. I keep telling him that I try my hardest to secure a good future, but it's never good enough. When I'm expressing to him how stressed I am and that I could use some motivation or just a fucking hug, I always get the 'highschool is the best time of your life' bullshit.\n\nWell, dad, guess what? For me it isn't. I study four levels (or how you'd call that in English Idk) above what you did. I often stay up until five in the morning doing my homework, dad. The lack of sleep is affecting my mental and physical health, dad. But you never cared about that. Because when the teachers give me a mark for not making my homework, you always scream at me. Because of this I can never really enjoy highschool, if I make one slip-up, you're ready to scold me.   \nSo dad, you can fuck right off with that 'highschool is great' crap. Thanks to you it's very stressful.  \n(Sorry, this turned into a rant.)",

It was so easy to see all of my friends and my evenings were never dull whether it be with study groups after school, playing games online or just going out to eat with my friends. Then the next day you’d get to recap the nights antics. Compared to my life now, my friends and I rarely get to catch up due to our busy schedules and when I look back to my time in high school I was definitely happier and felt that the world was my oyster.",

I just wanted to offer a perspective from someone relatively normal who has an NMum and who genuinely misses high school. I def sympathise with the OP as I dealt with the same pressures and somehow got pressured into undertaking an honours law degree by my NMum but am still not good enough.. that’s a whole other kettle of fish though haha.",
