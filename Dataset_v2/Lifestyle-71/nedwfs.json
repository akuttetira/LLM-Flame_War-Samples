Talking about it and trying to explain just incriminates you more sometimes. Being late, sitting down and just saying sorry is just enough.",

I remember once being an hour late to a dinner at one of my husband's relative's homes because my husband misunderstood that dinner **at** 5 doesn't mean ''**Anytime after 5**''. I immediately went into full over-explaining mode, apologizing profusely, you know the drill. The thing is, nobody really cared. The hostess thought we were probably stuck in traffic or something, so she just turned down the oven, and everyone else was still mingling and socializing.\n\nNow, in **MY** family, we would have been yelled at as soon as we walked in the door, told to go fix ourselves a plate from the ice-cold uncovered food in the kitchen, and every other time I had ever been late- or ''ruined'' some other event for some other reason- would have been thrown up in my face. Why are they like this?",

Not just because of a fear of getting scolded, mostly because we don't show the level respect that we get back. And because we really want to show respect we feel bad for being late. I feel like people are now interpreting it as you caring more about the fact of being late rather than the reason, while I feel like you actually mean the effort put into getting on time, i.e. the effort out into showing respect.\n\nAnd let's be real here, I think everyone here puts a little to much effort into showing respect.\n\nSorry if I misinterpreted this tho.",
