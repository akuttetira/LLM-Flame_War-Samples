Yes, I will play baby shark on loop for her an hour if she likes it. Yes, she is squealing with joy everywhere she goes. And yes, I will sing and dance alongside her.\n\nNo, I will not beat her ass for making noise. No, I will not feel ashamed if nobody praises me in public for her good behaviour. No, I will not laugh and make fun of her for being distressed or crying. No, I will not lock her in a closet if she disturbs my nap. No, I will not tell her that every other child in the world has terrible parents for letting them run around and be wild on the playground.\n\nI refuse. \n\nMy daughter is happy. She is having fun. I can teach her manners without taking away her liberty to be a kid.\n\nDeal with it mom.",

            "Reply_Text": "I live with my Nmom, who is now 80, as her caregiver. My two youngest kids were 8 and 9 back when we initially moved in, as I was newly divorced, both kids were undergoing ABA therapy daily for autism, and my dad was diagnosed with cancer 18 months later. My oldest daughter and son-in-law moved in to my home, which was right next door, but on 30 acres of almonds. My mom, at that time was on oxycontin for a work related accident that she had milked for about 15 years? Give or take. She was not going to give up her Oxys for anything so she always had a pain level of 8-9, hence, Oxycontin. Did I forget to mention that she had been an alcoholic for most of my life? I was 47 then. My daughter's family soon grew to 3 children, my father passed away and the martyr/mom took refuge in the living room, dead center, couch. From the time she opened her eyes around 6:30 am until she shuffled to bed, around 11 pm. That room revolved around her. And she made everyone MISERABLE. Until the day my daughter told me that she was no longer coming over because she was tired of Nana yelling at the kids. MY GRANDCHILDREN. I WAS DONE. I told my mother that the living room was for the LIVING, and she was not living, she was EXISTING. She was now going to stay in her room, where she had a tv. Meals would be brought to her. AND IT WORKED. What narcissist doesn't want to be catered to? A little visit now and then, I even got her a bigger tv, a Fire Stick, a Spotify account for her music. SHE NEVER LEAVES.We even sold the ranch and moved. I gave her the master bedroom. She feels like she is the queen. All her hateful comments are in one room. Locked away. Sigh... I do go visit but I CAN LEAVE. Best thing I ever did.",

Theirs was primarily focused on learning emotions and the socializing. They were homeschooled during their therapy so they didn't have anyone at school with them. I put them back in school after the two years, a private school with smaller class sizes. My daughter has done really well. She was a cheerleader for 3 years in high school. She didn't do it for her senior year. She wanted to have her time to be with her friends and just have fun. She's dated and has an amazing boyfriend right now. My son, who was diagnosed much earlier than his sister, had a rougher time. I moved him out of the private school into our local public high school in the middle of his sophomore year. He's flourished there. He loved public school. He needed a big school setting with lots of kids, more social interaction with lots of different personalities. It was far too limiting at the smaller school for him. He's been in school plays. He is still in touch with a couple of kids from the other school but has made a lot of friends at this school. He's a huge video game player and has a group of friends (all older than him) that he runs tournaments with at our house, they hang out here all weekend, eat our food, and are part of the family. We talk about how when he was little, did he ever imagine that he would have as many friends as he does now, and that when he would watch videos of people playing games on YouTube, did he ever imagine that his games would be on YouTube? He's come so far. Both of them have. But I tell them all the time, and always did, that if they had told me that there was a pill I could have given them to take away their autism, would I have done it? No, because it's made them who they are. I couldn't have one without the other. All their little quirks and sensory issues and likes and dislikes make them THEM.\nBUT... my son and I have had some heavy discussions about a family we know with twin boys who also have autism and how their parents are raising them. We were talking about the boys and my son said that as hard as his childhood was on him, and with everything that he and I went through (his father was involved in none of it and we divorced when they were 6 & 7) he is not sure he is willing to burden his own children with a possible autism diagnosis.
