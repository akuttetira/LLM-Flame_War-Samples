We are all responsible for our own emotions. (Yes, people can hurt us, but I’m thinking about “normal” situations). If a child is depressed about their birthday, it could be about something that you have no power over.  You cannot “make” someone happy. You can just act with empathy, and not make it about your own needs (the way your parents probably did). It’s so important to break the cycle!",

If a child is depressed a healthy person will respond to the situation by centering what the child needs. Yes, it may hurt you to hear that your child is hurting but you treat your pain as secondary so you can prioritize helping your child.\n\nIf you're a narc, on the other hand, then you find a way to make it all about you no matter what's happening with your child. Their emotions and needs are an inconvenience not important enough to be discussed, let alone require support that takes the attention off of you where it belongs.",

I explained it was a defensive move to protect me. But apparently I’m doing this to punish her and “stop her having that pleasure” of giving good gifts to us. It’s apparently me out to get her, not me trying to avoid more hurt and drama. I don’t know if she’s a narc but she shows some scary signs she might be and I don’t know that she knows it.\n\nShe asked what my husband would like one Christmas and never takes his Amazon list suggestion (he doesn’t expect people to buy from it, it’s just a “if you’re stuck, I’d like anything from here” and it’s got a range of low to higher priced items on it) and to be fair she did a good job that year for him with my help, though she’s gotten him some questionable things in the past (and one even seemed like a dig).\n\nFor me she never seems to ask what I might like and just gets me shoes or clothes and I’m quite particular with those and like some input.\n\nBut it’s not even about what she gets us. I’m not that fussy. It’s about what happens afterwards and how she doesn’t seem to put much thought into it where I’m concerned. She just assumed I’ll like something. To be fair, I’ve never rejected what she’s given me, and sometimes I even like it, I only mention if it’s clearly faulty and even then I’ll do it with grace and tact. But if they get a whiff I might not like something, it’s mentioned...and I’m made out to be ungrateful somehow. I’m too afraid to tell them if I don’t like something because I don’t want to hurt them, especially her. Mostly out of compassion as I never wanted her to feel bad, but I think partially out of fear. I just quietly get rid of it these days. Easier now that I don’t live there.\n\nEdit: Sorry, kind of went on a tangent there. It’s just the recent argument has been going a while and it stemmed from something I said about a gift that she (finally, months after it) got for my birthday. She’s making out she’s super sad and hurt about it and I’m saying this isn’t the main issue if *that* caused this months long argument, especially as I’ve since apologised for what was said (even though it was fairly innocuous).",

Apparently I’m “ungrateful”. She also was not interested in the Amazon wishlist.  I should mention it’s not about money, she spends a lot on these things. I’d be thrilled if she gave me a check or gift card for half of what she spent on this stuff.\n\nEven presents for you are about her, not you.",

We were both weirded out by it and this is the time I said it felt like a dig at him.\n\nHe likes to doodle. Draw. Write. He’ll do it when we’re out in a casual setting and has done it when we’ve been over at my parents house. They question me on why I don’t seem to mind it when I used to mind my sister doing it (she has aspergers, my husband doesn’t). I just told them I’ve come to accept it about both of them. Plus I’ve grown up since then. And my husband will put it away if you ask him to. They seemed to take offence that he’d do it at their house, when nobody was talking to him so what was he gonna do? He’s a quiet man and he’s never felt comfortable at their house - for reasons I now see. So one birthday they got him a small wooden box. Kinda nice. Not ornate and kinda cheap, but the cost of things don’t really come into it for us. Inside it was full of Marvel universe things. We both like Marvel, but I’m talking a kids colouring book, colouring pencils, erasers, pencils, etc. And a pinky/purple notebook (that sort of A/B foil that changes colour in the light when it moves) that looked more girly than anything. He was like...eeeehhhh....thanks!\n\nMuch later I asked them about it. They said it was a joke, and the main present was the box. I still don’t accept that it wasn’t a dig. As my counsellor has told me recently, “it’s only a joke if everybody is in on it and finds it funny”.",

Every birthday, every Christmas, my mother will ask me what I would like- she asks lots of detailed questions like what colour/ size/ style/ where to buy it etc. In my entire life she has bought the thing we discussed once.\n\nWhen I was a kid she would typically buy me a cheap knock-off version of whatever I had asked for (a generic fashion doll instead of a Barbie, market stall trainers instead of brand name ones, a blue summer dress if I asked for a black Goth dress)- it wasn't about money because she would buy a load of tat to go with the gift, so the whole pile cost more than the one thing I actually wanted. One Christmas I tried to explain that although it was kind of her to spend £80 on a necklace with a verse about mothers and daughters engraved on it, it just wasn't my style and I would have preferred the £25 earrings she'd asked for the details of. She. Went. Ballistic. I was ungrateful, I was cruel, I didn't deserve her thoughtfulness and consideration...\n\nIn recent years she will give me boxes of gifts (lots of little bits and pieces)- most of them are pre-loved and sometimes well used... she's given me chocolates with bites taken out, wrapped up as a gift. Body cream with half of it used. A slightly burnt candle.\n\nKeeps me in my place, eh? 😏",

I tried to see it as them trying to be thoughtful and considerate but ending up way off the mark but they didn’t even ask about that sort of thing. Plus I didn’t expect them to get me gear anyway as it’s expensive (for the real thing, anyway!).\n\nI never used it and eventually years later it got decluttered and donated to a charity shop. I’ve had so much tat over the years. I’ve had some nice things too, like video games and once we got a Wii, but I stopped playing console games eventually because I was made to feel bad about playing them during the day (lazy) and I couldn’t play them in the living room at night since they’d be watching TV. They did set up a room to play games in but it was uncomfortable, the chair was lumpy and the room smelled of the dogs since it was their “bedroom” lol.\n\nThat’s awful about the chocolates though, not had anything that bad at least.

But there was something about “smudging” in it that I found odd as as far as I’m aware it relates to new age/Wicca practices so it made me a little uncomfortable (I’m a Christian) but only as a point of “oh, turn to page xyz, it says bla bla bla and I thought that related to Wicca etc. Bit odd” I was looking for reassurance from my mother, an older Christian, I guess? I could have worded it better really. She got the same book at the same time.\n\nAnyway, she got down about it. She said she didn’t know it was in there as if I implied she did (I didn’t) and then got all surly later but pretended nothing was wrong right up until I accepted that maybe she *was* ok and I was reading too much into what she was saying on messenger. Then she said “have you ever considered not being so negative?”\n\nI wasn’t being, I was a bit uncertain if anything, not sure what to make of it, but she makes out I was looking for something bad to say about it when in reality I was just absent mindedly flicking through it. I said it was ok, I didn’t need to pay attention to that bit if I didn’t like it and I left it there, but that wasn’t enough. Kept telling me to send the book back to Amazon if I didn’t want it even after I’d said it was fine. I hadn’t said thank you for the gift yet though, and I think it was partially because we were already on thin ice from a previous argument of her nagging me to read health things even after her saying it was up to me if I read them or not. Plus I was ill. And kind of annoyed it was now March/April and my birthday was 3-4 months ago. And various other things. She much much later (as in a couple of weeks ago while we were still discussing it all) brought up the gifts that failed for Christmas and my birthday - shoes. One pair was too big even with thick socks and the others were faulty (and ugly as heck so I’m so glad they were faulty, but she doesn’t know I think that). She said she thought she’d finally got me something I liked with the book but even that “wasn’t up to scratch” and she’d never mentioned the shoes before. She said she was only bringing it up to give context to how she finally felt about the book (reasonable for most people I guess) but the hidden subtext seems to be it’s my fault the shoes didn’t work out or that I rejected them somehow when I didn’t, especially as she’s never brought them up before. She got me to try the ugly shoes on to see if they fit and it was obvious they were faulty. But yeah, to hear her say “you’re punishing me for something and taking away the pleasure I get from giving gifts” was like wow, really? You’re making this about YOU? I even said as much but she had no real answer. It felt like a mask slipping moment. It’s never been about trying to get back at her. I just want it all to be normal.",
