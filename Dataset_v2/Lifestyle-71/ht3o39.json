    "post_text ": "She looked like she was 14 or 15. We were all in the underwear aisle. She looked so embarrassed. She turned to him and said \"Dad, I need underwear.\"\n\nHe looked at her, then said, \"Do you want me to turn around?\"\n\nShe said yes in the smallest voice. He turned his back to her. She looked through the underwear, got what she wanted and put it in the cart. Then she said, \"I'm finished.\"\n\nHe turned around and said, \"Honey, if you're uncomfortable with me doing something like this with you, just tell me. I can go do something else. I don't want you to feel embarrassed. I know it's weird to be in this aisle with your dad. In fact, I think you're old enough to come back here by yourself next time.\"\n\nShe smiled and said, \"Thanks dad.\"\n\nHe smiled back and said, \"Thanks for not asking me if they were cute like you did with your dresses.\"\n\nI almost cried. Like I laughed but tears welled up in my eyes. He respected her privacy and rights as an individual. He respected her boundries. He acknowledged her feelings and validated them. He encouraged her and her independence. \n\nMy dad never did those things. He was gross. He asked me very invasive questions. Seeing that reminded me that my dad sucked, but that there are awesome dads in the world. \n\nTo all you awesome dads out there, thanks.",

Do you guys think father's assume girls can grow without needing underwear?\n\nAnd, yes, I do have a 15 year old daughter. I really don't think her choice of under garments could be a source of embarrassment to either of us.",

We were punished for trying to be our own person or feeling an emotion the narc didn't like.\n\nThis girl's father obviously knew his daughter needed to be reassured and dignified, and he did that.",
