Sometimes I wouldn’t eat enough during the day (bc she literally never left me alone about anything) and I’d wait until 3am to eat...kind of awful the only time I could “be” in my own home was when the monster was snoring lol.",

Not every relationship is meant to be permanent, if their partner has the freedom to choose to behave in toxic ways than op has the equal freedom to remove themselves from that behavior.\n\nAnd not everyone is like a narc parent, op should be able to date their way through the pool however they feel fit.  This pandemic has shown a lot of us the worst sides of our so bc narcs have difficulty wearing their masks 24/7 for months on end.\n\nI think it’s naive and dangerous to tell anyone that they should just ignore red flags and work through them. You can’t work through a red flag when you’re the only one working.\n\nWhy would you hold op to a higher standard than their so? Why does op have to show more loyalty and love WHILE being abused? Why don’t you put the weight of that loyalty and love on the abuser?  Why are you equating toxic and abusive behavior to a “normal” rough patch in a relationship?  Why are you condemning op to “discarding” their so- isn’t the so discarding op when they abuse them?   Hope my reply isn’t too harsh.",
