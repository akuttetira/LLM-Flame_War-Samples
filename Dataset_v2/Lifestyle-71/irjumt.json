    "post_text ": "The bowl shattered and I stained the rug. I started sobbing, because I expected to be yelled at, or even hit, because I'd broken a bowl from a set, and had stained the carpet. My step-mum told me to stop crying and said she'd serve me more ice cream. I was confused. I broke a bowl, that's a bad thing, why am I still getting my treat? She told me she knew I didn't mean it, and the bowl was less important than my own safety. That was the first time any woman my father had dated, (including my Nmum) that had ever treated me kindly. It was the first time I realised not all women are like that, and I wasn't necessarily destined to grow up to be a woman like my mother, or my father's ex's",

It’s sad whenever a step parent is a better parent then the biological parent (and this isn’t to say they aren’t real parents, because they definitely are)\n\nIt’s a mistake, so it should be treated like that, it’s not like you intentionally slammed it into the ground shattering the bowl. But yall need some better bowls, I’ve dropped mine probably hundreds of times and it still is fine",

The only ones who will ever understand that, and I mean truly understand, are those who also suffer it.\nIt's like trying to explain a rainbow to a blind person, or why you love milk to someone who is extremely lactose intolerant (milk tastes sour to them and leaves a really bad aftertaste in their mouth, which let's them know they are in fact drinking milk and should spit it out unless they want to cry on the toilet for five hours. This reaction is, in a sense, a defense mechanism. The connection of lactose and the after effects causes you to develop, over time, a fake flag when consuming it. Or so I've been told that why it tastes like I'm drinking sour milk from three years ago no matter how fresh.)\n\nI suffer Bipolar, and my SO has severe depression, and even then, we still fail to really understand what the other is experiencing. We have minor understandings, but we still don't truly know just what to do or say in situations when we have an episode because they're completely different types of mental illnesses. We try to apply our own methods on each other and it's a coin toss at that point of success or failure.\n\nPoint being, I'm glad you don't feel resentment towards the lack of understanding. It takes time to really get it when you don't experience it, and even then, you'll never truly get it, just kinda, graze the point.",

I think it's just the circle of people you socialize with.
