I always felt infringed upon and violated. But with my kid... Meh. She wants her space. I am not threatened by this. She's just being her, and I respect that. Because I am not my mother. ✊\n\nEdit: Went to bed and woke up to 2K upvotes. This issue clearly struck a chord. I wish I could adequately respond to everyone. Just know that I see you and admire you. ❤️",
