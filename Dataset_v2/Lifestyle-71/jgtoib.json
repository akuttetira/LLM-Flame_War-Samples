    "post_text ": "Not sure why I was thinking about this today, but - I remember when I was a kid I didn't know how to do things that I guess seem like they \"should\" be obvious, but... realized that they're probably only obvious when you know how to do them, and a kid would have to be taught. And I wasn't. I just had to figure stuff out, or do things wrong and be ridiculed for it. \n\nFor example I distinctly remember not knowing how to hand wash dishes, I just sort of submerged them in the sink full of soapy water and swished them around and figured \"Yeah, that looks like what's happening when people wash dishes, that must be how it goes\" I didn't realize you had to scrub them or anything. I was probably too young to be asked to wash the dishes in the first place, but either way no one actually taught me. Or I remember not knowing how to dry off after taking a shower for whatever reason, I'd just sort of huddle under a towel while I ended up mostly air-drying. I felt like an idiot for stuff like that for a long time, but... I was just a kid. Kids need to be taught things.\n\nAnd of course now I still assume I need to figure everything out myself and hate asking for help with anything lol.",

I won't punish anyone with details but pads were not a good option for me even when I was young. For my cousins birthday we went to a Waterpark and I didnt want to miss it because of my period so she finally let me start using them. I was the oldest girl on a trip with all younger girls and my uncle.\n\n\nShe wouldn't buy them until we were waiting for my uncle to pick me up and go to the water park!!! I mean, she sent me clueless to figure out tampons for the first time alone and in public. She was adamant that Im fine on my own and she didn't want to talk about how vaginas work, at all. She didn't even send me with the box and instructions. My poor uncle had to try his best to teach me then when I was crying/embarrassed and decided to sit out all day, a lifeguard had to teach me with all of these grown women laughing and making fun of me in the bathroom.\n\n\nI'm now starting to wonder if this is exactly what my mom wanted to happen, public shame and borderline traumatic embarrassment",

While i was in the bathroom crying trying to get it out my mom accused me of “playing with” myself. She started screaming at me because we had a dinner guest coming and I was supposed to be helping prepare. She was like “ok if it’s really stuck then i’ll take you to the emergency room right now” and just made it even more humiliating. I didn’t want it to be a big deal I just wanted some compassion and guidance. Some people are really just so cold and apathetic it’s baffling.",
