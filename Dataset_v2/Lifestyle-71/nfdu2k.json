My nMother has called my enabler brother a racist because he has opposing views from her on immigration.  Keep in mind, that my daughter which he adores is mixed and that for several years we lived in a border state.  We have seen the effects of immigration policies up close.  Plus, my daughter's father's family legally immigrated and hold the same views.\nDon't even get me started on my nGandmother...she was heavily involved in politics and that party all thought she was great.  Basically, did a lot of damage to her children and grandchildren.  Sure, a great party person but an absolute wreck of a human being.  Narcissistic  people came do damage that extends for generations.\nPersonally, as to politics I could care less what party.  I vote for the best candidate.  Unfortunately, at times it a choice between the lessor of two evils.",
