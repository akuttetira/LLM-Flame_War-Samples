She’ll bait you into an argument and you’ll stay calm for awhile but she’ll push and push until you finally lose your temper, and then she’ll get this sh*t eating sly little grin on her face and calmly and quietly say “look how crazy you’re acting.” Or “why are you yelling at me?” Makes me sick.",

They want you to feel flawed and share in the drama and chaos that THEY start. Let me leave you with this: Reacting to the abuser does not make you an abuser!!!! You are human; you have human limits. Your reaction to being attacked whether emotionally or physically is your basic HUMAN RIGHT. She is the one with the problem. Period. She wants you to feel guilty. Don’t. Maybe you should grey rock your mom. Narcissists use stuff like this to feed their hollow souls. She feeds on these situations to survive. Starve her.",

It’s almost like you’re conditioned to have your buttons pushed by her and get angry/emotional - which you have been by her your whole life. You’ve been groomed to supply her like this. Don’t react to it, just look away and say nothing, as if you didn’t hear it. But not in a passive aggressive way, rather completely emotionless. Change the topic to something about her, ask a question about something mundane. Like “so did your rose bush recover from the aphids?” Narcs love to talk about their own stuff so this will work like a charm. If she’s hell bent on talking about your flaws, just say “ok” or “if you say so”. You will be astonished by the results.\nMy nmom does the exact same thing or at least used to. It drove me crazy. I still have so much pent up anger from years of enduring this. But then I realized that her opinions are stupid, that she’s mean and not normal and that she doesn’t deserve to have any power whatsoever about my emotions. She’s just a little troll who thinks they’re so clever and powerful but she’s really just extremely dumb. Now when I don’t react to her bullshit, you can literally see how insecure she gets. It’s almost as if she’s gonna start crying. Get ready for the love bombing and hovering after that. The trick is to never again let your guard down, even then.",

Like wow...cause they certainly dont act like it?\n\nI'm psychic myself or I guess you could say I have a 6th sense but of course as little kids I guess its just the way we can feel certain people out.\n\nWell K remember a lot of things as toddler even when I didnt talk much. Like I remember the things I felt and why and what it wss like being around my aunts and cousins and stuff.\n\nLike its true what they say about kids is that they can tell whos a bad person/ or like they can feel the energy or whatever.\n\nI'm not saying my moms a bad person but I remember feeling something and experiencing it first hand as a kid/ toddler.\nI barely recently told this to my a so ling a few years back\n\nBut basically as a little one I was always attached to my siing more than my mom more than anyone. That if I was out of my siblings arms for more than what was comfortable I would get fussy or uncomfortably agitated. And cry loudly. I know all kids do that. But with my cousins or aunts I would be with them but I could feel they werent familiar people but I knew they were family just you know seperation anxiety.\n\nBur one thing I remember is that my mom was there and it wasnt that I didnt know she was my mom or I didnt know she had held me before. I remember her asking if she could hold me. And I felt sad and scared cause I wanted to stop being passed around to everyone. I just wanted to stay in one spot. When they put me in my moms arms I started crying immediately because she felt unknown to me even though I knew who she was and I could tell she didnt know what to do or say to calm me down but she tried. She sings this song to babies to calm them down and even to this day when I hear it I become calm just like that day. But the point of the story is that even though eventually I was calm for a bit she held me in her arms. And I felt something so different from her than the other adults in the room. On the outsidd she was smiling and laughing but in her arms I felt I connected with her energy/vibe. It felt like pure empty space. Like what I understand now to be an empty void or hollow.\nNot hollow like she didnt have a heart beat...just..hollow and the energy was just.like nervous/complete opposite of that comforting feeling.\n\nSo I dont really know. But as a baby/toddler I did remember feeling weird that I was feeling this from my mother. Like I could feel her pain.",

I wouldn't even know where to start with the slamming doors and the like.\nWhen I finally went no contact with her this past March for the entire previous year literally every single damn morning everyone in the house was awoken to the sounds of her completely unjustified temper tantrums. I am talking Every. Single. Fucking. Day. Waking up to the sounds of doors slamming, random obscenities and threats being SCREAMED at nobody in particular, loud ranting, again aimed towards nobody in particular about \"all of these sorry ass worthless motherfuckers, no good stupid, lazy, filthy, pieces of shit who all need to just go fucking die, stupid fucking worthless whore/bitch, dumb fucking cunt, etc, etc\" (the funny part is that SHE was the only lazy/filthy person in the house, my older brother and I are actually clean freaks while she had no problem living in her own filth. She even had to abandon her house because she let it get so nasty like one of those hoarder houses) things being thrown around the house and broken, objects and doors being kicked, the dogs being hit, kicked, and called names. Imagine waking up this every damn day. It was so horrible that I just wanted to go to sleep every night and die in my sleep so that I did not have to put up with it anymore. If not for my own young daughter I would have killed myself without a doubt just to get away from this life. \"Depressing\" does not even begin to describe it..",

It's just incredible how out of character people will get when they're no longer able to manipulate you in the way they want.

For me with my nmom, it's dangerous to keep grey rocking and provoke her by not showing any reaction, because if I don't act like a whimpering weak child over who she thinks she has complete power over now, she will continue to pick on me and say harsh things until she bursts on everyone in the house.\nThe other members in the house start blaming me for provoking her to the extreme, and for not bowing down to her and give her the reactions that she wants. A curfew is put on for a few days where everyone walks on eggshells around her, trying to please her until she calms down and wants to be all happy and friendly with everyone in the house again.",
