    "post_text ": "[The original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/lv1plf/i_got_a_warning_at_the_nursing_home_i_work_at_for/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\nThe woman emailed to complain about my colleague's behavior, saying she was being judgemental and rude. She also thanked me for stepping in and explained she didn't say anything at the time because she was so anxious and stressed about seeing her mother and then being judged on top of that made it hard to speak or stand up for herself. She didn't go into detail into her relationship with her mother, she just said she feels uncomfortable around her and would prefer not to be judged about her unwillingness to see her.\n\nSo my supervisor apologized to me but mentioned I should try a slightly more diplomatic way of intervening next time, which is fair. My colleague has been warned not to make judgemental comments in front of residents or family. It won't stop my colleagues talking amongst themselves about how ungrateful or cruel they think some adult children are just for not visiting, but maybe it'll prevent more people from being judged to their face.",

Good on you, OP!",

Harassment is one of those buzzwords used by many and HR has to take it seriously if it really was harassment, which in this case, it’s not, because it’s not repeated, unwelcomed behaviors.\n\nEdit: not sure why I was down voted. No where does it say the coworker claimed “harassment.” I’m making just as much of a conclusion and assumption as the person above me. Also, look up what harassment is before you get pissed that I didn’t exactly validate misinformation.",
