    "post_text ": "I constantly hear judgement from my colleagues about the adult children who don't visit their parents. I've bitten my tongue so far, but recently I had to step in when a colleague actually confronted a resident's adult child about it. \n\nWe have a resident who has 5 kids, 2 of whom have never visited. The other 3 have only visited once each, to deal with some legal documents and manage family affairs, and were all strictly business while they were there. Recently one of her children made an appointment to visit in order to drop off some photos she had asked her for, and when she arrived she decided to ask us to deliver the photos rather than visit face to face, citing covid concerns even though we do allow visits. My colleague decided to guilt trip her about her poor lonely mother who has been looking forward to the visit all week. I had to intervene and apologize to the poor woman, and I told my colleague that if all 5 of someone's kids are apprehensive about seeing them, it says more about them than it does about their kids. I got a warning, but I think it was worth it.\n\nUpdate: the woman emailed to complain about my colleague and thank me for stepping in, so I received an apology and my colleague has been warned not to make judgemental comments in front of residents or family.",

It's not their place. It's also not the place of the first employee to do the guilt trip.\n\nIf OP just said 'knock it off' then they shouldnt get a warning, however, it sounds like they the  proceeded to give their opinion on the family which was not appropriate.",
