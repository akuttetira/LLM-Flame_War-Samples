    "post_text ": "My parents are anti maskers... And they hate the fact that I wear masks everywhere all the time...\n\nThey've tried many tricks to prevent me from wearing masks and most of the time it hasn't worked...\n\nWe've had countless nights fighting over this and my parents always end with \"I wish we had a faithful child who wouldn't argue with us about what's right n what's wrong\"\n\nThis time they pulled a new trick...\n\nI have a massive allergy to a lot of deoderants and perfumes... And also many scents of flowers and essential oils (you probably know where I'm going with this) they cause me to have continuous sneezing, headaches, nausea, dizziness, stomach ache, a hard time breathing, and I've even slipped/fallen from the dizziness it causes me...\n\nMy parents scented all 3 of my masks that I have (I generally wash em after using em once so I need 3 because it takes time for them to dry up) right before we were about to leave the house for a \"new years party\" which I was forced to go to...\n\nI realised that they did so, and I was really angry at first but couldn't do much... I had to keep my mask up in the uber for the whole ride and it started giving me a massive headache, the specific smells I noticed were naphthalene, and jasmine which irritate me the most...\n\nI tried keeping my mask on for the whole time but it was really tough for me to do so...\n\nBecause of the smell I had to take multiple trips to the washroom to throw up, I couldn't stand properly and it felt like hell...\n\nMy parents reaction to this you ask? They did nothing, just looked at me and laughed... \"So how's the mask going on for you? The mask seems to be affecting you right now, why don't you take it off?\", \"poor kid has breathing problems it seems... Only if he wasn't wearing a mask\"...\n\nI'm sick now cuz of this and can't get very far out of bed because of my stomach ache... It goes away for a few minutes and comes back to annoy the fuck out of me...",

But this person is still under their hold with no way out. It's better to lay low, hide the masks and hand wash them yourself in hot water. Slip away some detergent or buy your own bottle and keep everything to yourself. Do not share anything with them or let them touch your masks ever. Report them for poisoning regardless of evidence so they have a paper trail.",

If they find out it was you, they will make your life worst. Narcs love attention...any attention. All you would be doing is giving them a supply and more interest in messing with you. They will not be angry about this, they be happy and more willing to continue this cycle of attack on you.\n\nNarcs are not human beings. They do not react like human beings. They do not have human empathy. The best you can do is be aware of what they do to you and keep a record of it. Writing down information like dates and what they did (for child services or the police). The best you can do is not give attention, as best as you can until you're out of there. Also make sure anyone that you trust and care about knows your situation and keep them aware about what is going on in your life. Narcs isolate and keep their victims to themselves.",
