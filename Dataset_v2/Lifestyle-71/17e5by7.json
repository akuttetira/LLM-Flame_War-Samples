    "post_text ": "This is my husband’s account but I don’t have one and I really need advice so I had to post on here. We have three little girls under the age of six. Im pregnant with baby number 4 and we just had our gender reveal party with family today. He has really been wanting a son ever since our first child was born. I personally don’t care about the gender so If I ever had a son I know I’d be so happy. He on the other hand ruined our gender reveal party and he says he isn’t sorry. We counted down and cut the cake and the icing was pink. I was so happy but he yelled “f no” threw the plastic knife across the yard and kicked the whole table over. Our other daughters looked at their dad and said “you don’t like girls?” He stomped off and told me it was my fault we were having another girl. I have no control over what we have but my kids and I will always remember how he acted over this gender reveal. I get people can be disappointed with gender but throwing things and kicking things is too much.",
