    "post_text ": "Alright. Bear with me. I scrolled this sub for a good half hour and didn’t see anyone mentioning this, so I will in case anyone is looking for new weekly entertainment. \n\nThere’s this comedian named Ziwe— also her @ on twitter, she’s on IG as @ziwef— who started a series on IG Live called “Baited” where she discusses white privilege and racism... with white, privileged (possibly racist) people. \n\nLast week she had Caroline Calloway on and HOLY SHIT it was a trainwreck. Caroline’s manager called her a bunch of times and made her abruptly end the livestream because she was saying so much embarrassing stuff. Tomorrow it’s Alison Roman’s turn and I can’t wait to hear what flies out of *her* mouth 😂\n\n\n\n** filed under politics because since the topic is racism and the birth of this show was because of the BLM movement I figured that would be it. please correct if I’m wrong!",
