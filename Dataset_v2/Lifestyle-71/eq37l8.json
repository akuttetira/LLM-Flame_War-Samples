Danielle contacted her and asked her to take them down, and offered payment. She later backtracked, said she will not be paying retail or resale value, and threatened to destroy Jade's Poshmark business by contacting the CEO. \n\nJade posted all receipts on her story, they can be found here: https://imgur.com/a/T9UMfqi",

Holy shit they’re a bunch of ghouls, Alice in particular who is yammering on about Jade having stolen property and that she should hand it back and grovel. I’m sorry, wut?! In what universe is it theft to buy discarded goods at goodwill and resell them online? GOMI needs to GOMI, I occasionally enjoy threads there but lately every one has been absolutely vile.",

You don't get to keep property put into the world market without permission and make a profit from it just because you shrug and say 'well I found it at goodwill!' The minute she was informed that property was not released or intended for sale she is obligated to return the property and take any compensation offered if she's lucky enough to be offered any.

Yeah, that seems way more professional and worthy of sympathy and viral hashtag-team-reseller support.\n\n> And Danielle is a dumbass as well. She should have contact the police and her lawyers to retrieve the property rather than try to be the 'cool influencer' who handles things directly with people. Because this is what happens.

Danielle needs to stop handling business matters via DM. Everyone involved needs to grow tf up.\n\n(Start of since-deleted response)\nThis is actually simply not true. Jade is not obligated to return anything that she legally acquired and paid for. It's Danielle's (costly) mistake for not having \"sample\" or \"not for resale\" on any of her tags. I asked my SIL (who is an attorney) what the stipulations on this whole situation would be, who technically owns the property, etc, and she mirrored it similar to a stolen car. If person A steals a car and sells it to person B, then person C (the first owner of the car) cannot demand the car back from person B, as he is the owner of the car. Person C can only go after person A (the thief) for damages. Person B, who bought the car not knowing it was stolen gets to keep the car with no repercussions unless he wanted to sell it back to person C for whatever price he wanted. Not even the police could do anything about it, as Danielle even admitted herself that the items were donated, albeit by mistake. They were discarded. The end. The ONLY way that Jade would be facing any kind of prosecution would be if SHE or someone on her team stole the items HERSELF, which I strongly believe didn't happen. The items are in no way, shape or form stolen if Jade purchased the items at a thrift store.\n\nETA: we wore what thread is now locked.",
