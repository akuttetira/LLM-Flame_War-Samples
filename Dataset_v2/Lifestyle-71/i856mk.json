    "post_text ": "My mother used to love to use that comeback. When she had company coming over and was too lazy to clean up her/my dads mess herself, she’d get mad at me because I “didn’t clean up the obvious mess.” And that she “shouldn’t have had to ask me because everything was always left to her.” (That was a Texas size lie, she’d always get me to clean up her messes for her). If I had the nerve to step out of my room without a broom in one hand and a dustpan in the other, it was a guaranteed guilt trip and hearing the poor men’s from my mother all day. \n\nWas anyone else’s parent(s) like that?",

Doing the dishes should never be the person who cooked dinners job. The child should be given an easy list to begin with and as they get older it should get harder. Chores prepare you for the real world. What you see as lazy now might change. It might not but always keep an open mind about keeping the house clean\nIf you feel you're being taken advantage of, sit your parents down and CALMLY tell them what you feel is wrong. Make a list of your expected chores and don't complain if they add a small job. JUST DO IT",

To people with the same ideas🤯BTW I only haven't chosen to have kids because I don't want them to be like you and blame me for eeevvveerthhiiinnnggg that goes wrong. I expected people to disagree with me but I thought they'd give smarter points. All you've done is try to offend me personally",

You havent contributed to any real discussion here, your initial post and every comment is full of angsty vitriol and disparagement, and ironically \"whining\" a lot more than anybody else. Lol. Playing devil's advocate or civilly disagreeing with others is perfectly fine and probably would not get downvoted, complaining+disparaging others not so much. Youre obviously not here to have civil discussion. You're out to personally attack people and label their experiences as laziness. Your behavior has blatant elements of Narc \"(truth stating) What I say is the truth, (downplaying+gaslighting) their parents aren't narcissists, youre a whining adult, etc\" this is really not the place for your attitude. Plus that's not fact. It's all your opinions. Everybody has an opinion, yours isn't special or superior. Didn't think I'd have to spell it out but you're exhibiting no insight or wisdom here.\nKids in a healthy relationship with their parents do not blame their parents for \"eeeeverythingggg\", and when they do it's a really normal phase of development (teenage rebellion). I find it odd you think a perfectly normal human phase is so horrid and unforgiveable. If you think normal healthy development is a bad thing then I worry about your spiteful parenting skills and budding narcissistic traits. I wouldn't wish for anyone to be your kid if you treat them with hate. If the massive amount of people here are really ALL rebellious angsty kids then that's fine? Considering the sheer number and living with an Nparent I'm okay with taking their experiences at face value. The one small superficial problem is the surface of a much deeper relationship with a Narc which you don't seem to understand. Narcissistics have a hard time with introspection so I doubt you'll take in anything I said but that's the gist of your problem.",
