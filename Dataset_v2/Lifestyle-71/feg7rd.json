    "Post_Title": "My brother has started ending phone calls with \"I love you\"",
    "post_text ": "I was on the phone with my brother a few weeks ago. We shot the shit, he talked about his new job and I talked about school. Usually phone calls between my siblings and I end with a \"Well, gotta go. Talk to you later\" and that's it. Growing up we didn't get told I love you at all from our parents, and never got shown any physical affection. It was just normal for us to reflect that in the relationship on each other because we didn't know anything else. \n\nSo we get to the end of our phone call and I go for the classic \"talk to you later\" and he responds \"ok, I love you\". It caught me so off guard that I had trouble even processing those words before he hung up. \"L-love... you too...\".\n\nThese last few weeks I've tried my hardest to end all of the phone calls I have with him and my sisters with \"I love you\". Its such a small thing, but I can always hear the smiles on their faces in their response.",

I'm going to have to try that with my sister.  We're both so cold and cut off from emotion it's scary.  Thank you guys for being a reminder of the work done, and the work that needs to be done.  This place actually helps me out.  Lol",
