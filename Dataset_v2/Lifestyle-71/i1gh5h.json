    "post_text ": "I could take the physical abuse. I could take the bullying at my new school after we moved, that no one noticed until I started pulling my hair out.\n\nI could take being responsible for my moms emotional needs. I could take her severe depression and the ever-present fear of her suicide. I could take the berating and constant scolding. I could take my ever-victim dad coming on weekends complaining about how mean my mom treats him. I could take them fighting and spitting in each other's face. I could take being forced to use my own pocket money to buy a school bag I was embarrassed to wear. I could take my mom throwing all my stuff in a pile in the middle of my room because she wasn't pleased with the way I tidied my room. I could take being treated like a piece of garbage for a large part of my childhood.\n\nBut I couldn't take that there was no one there who asked me what I wanted. Who gave a damn about how  I was feeling. Who showed just a LITTLE interest in me, other than that my heart was still beating. I couldn't take that I didn't get to do fucking normal kid things, because they were \"dangerous\". You rather had me clean the garage or the cellar or my room for the 3rd day in a row. \n\nThen, when things normalized, I was supposed to become a successful young man - \"such a talented, bright boy\"\n\nMy lack of \"success\" is my greatest fucking achievement. It was the big, nuclear middle finger in your faces and you had it coming dear parents. \n\nNever will I live a life you will be proud of in any way. I will always fight against the messed up world you failed to prepare me the to thrive in. You made me a rebel - after holding this shit in for almost three decades I am finally admitting the truth: you failed me.  I would have been better off without you.\n\nI am taking things into my own hands now. I will give that inner child all the love you didn't. I will hold it lovingly until every single tear of grief has been cried. I will give it all the fun it was never allowed to have when my parents were my cruel and incompetent dictators. \n\nUntil we both are at peace. I love you, you sweet, sweet, innocent little boy. I will never abandon you. You are my everything! This adult here will never tell you to shut up or \"why the fuck are you crying, you character-pig\". He will never abuse you and when you raise your arms in a defensive reflex scream \"HOW DARE YOU RAISE YOUR HAND AGAINST ME?!\"\n\nUntil we are both ok, that is a promise, however long it takes.",

They'll say, \"look at the successful kid I raised!\" I'm gonna show them the type of kid they raised. It may be incredibly ignorant, but I need to prove to them that they were disgusting parents. Like that quote that says it takes a whole village to raise a child, but the child will burn the village down just to feel it's warmth, and I intend to do just that.",

Is it a job where you work with people, or more of a technical job?  My job is mostly technical, but with enough social aspects that I could learn how to talk to people while I’m working.  I kind of used it as practice for learning how to meet new people and build relationships with them.\n\nIf you’re passionate about your job, you might also define success as doing your job well.  If it’s a job that’s not very well paid, but makes a difference in the lives of others, I’d certainly be proud of that.  If it’s a job with lots of potential for growth, focus on gaining experience and building a career out of it.  Following that path is something to be proud of, as well.",
