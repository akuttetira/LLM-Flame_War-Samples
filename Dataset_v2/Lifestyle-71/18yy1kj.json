    "post_text ": "That's all I got.... Holy shit,  my 8 year old started her period today\n\nIt happened while she was a friends house and i was at work.  She used her tablet to take a picture of her panties and send it to me.  We'd had the talk and read the books a couple months ago,  so thankfully it wasn't a Carrie moment... \n\nThere have been signs,  but nothing obvious. I thought I noticed buds developing several months ago,  but dismissed it.  She was avoiding wearing shorts in the summer because of her leg hair... but fuck... I thought I had like,  a couple more years. \n\nI left work early,  went to target for supplies.  I wanted to include a stuffy that she'd appreciate, and it sank in that I'm in the little kids section buying cutsie little kids stuffed animals while shes dealing with this incredibly adult thing.  I cried at target. \n\nI gave her the supplies,  a bouquet of flowers,  and told her all the things.  She listened,  she asked questions,  she responded so positively. I don't think it could've gone better,  but fuck... this is so much for a single mom just trying to get by\n\nHow the hell am I supposed to teach someone who keeps an active booger wall how to properly take care of menstrual pads?! \n\nI can't... I just... can't\n\nETA: her gift basket consisted of a bouquet of flowers,  2 packages of period panties (4 in each pack), pads, a reusable gel hot pack,  beef jerky, and a stuffy to love on. I would've added chocolate,  but it's right after the holidays ave we are drowning in candy haha... not gonna lie, I got me a box of wine too 🤣",

Mother was projecting her feelings rather than thinking of her daughter’s (not in a bad way), and gave flowers accordingly.",

It gives you something new to deal with but as a human being you are the same person you were yesterday. Do you love rock and roll and 1920s animation shorts? Well then you're still allowed to. Do you like dolls and ballet? Then you are still allowed to. Do you like scrimshaw and hang gliding? Then you're still allowed to. Nothing about you as a human being has changed just like you don't go through a transformation when you get a bloody nose or you lose a fingernail in a carpentry accident.\n\n>You can't be the same level of carefree kid anymore,\n\nAlso? How does blood coming from your vagina mean you can't be carefree?\n\n>you have hygiene chores and need to keep track of time and period supplies.\n\nIt's really not that difficult to put in a new pad when yours gets full. As for keeping track of supplies that is the parents job. The child does not have a job. The child does not have a debit card. The child does not have a car. The adult is the one who needs to go to the store and purchase these supplies.\n\nGiving a period any kind of value judgment, positive or negative, is extremely weird to me. I mean think about it, would you go get your son flowers for his first nocturnal emission?",

If you got your period at 15 then of course it didn’t mean anything. You were nearly able to drive. You knew everything you needed to know about it. An 8 year old is still a child. Not a teenager. The fact that you cannot put that together in your head is shocking.",

Considering the fact that flowers are given for birth, deaths, and weddings then yes, flowers are used to mark huge life events. Walk in and you see a vase flowers you know something is up. I've never heard of anybody buying flowers for somebody just for the sake of buying flowers... Well that with our cultures sexist ideas involving little girls, their bodies, and compared to the fact that we have no equivalent for a little boys and yes, the whole thing perpetuates the idea that a period is something other than a non-event in your life. Which it should be.\n\n>My partner brought me flowers the other day for no reason at all - should I be freaked out?\n\nHonestly, I'd have been weirded out. Flowers for no reason....the fuck? Why not just start a meal train at that point?\n\n>My mom gave me a hug when I started my period. Should that have traumatized me? Was it too much? Because I just found it comforting during a confusing transition.\n\nStill weirded out. Did you have the idea in your head that this was some kind of transition before she made a big deal out of it? Or did you let sex ed get to you, all those \"you're going to be a woman\" soon talks? Did you never, ever, question why the same thing isn't done for boys?",

I just like flowers. What a truly bizarre take.\n\nAnd no. I saw blood, told my mom, she hugged me and asked if I had any questions. I said no, put on a pad, and went to school. Literally no one in my life ever told me ‘you’re going to be a woman soon’ - but it’s possible that bloody underwear can be startling the first time, even if you’re educated. My mom’s hug and support made the blood not scary. Seeing blood on my underwear *was not normal for me* and even though I knew it was coming, I was young and needed some reassurance. Why are you making that sound like a toxic thing for a child to need?\n\nPuberty is something that needs to be discussed for both genders? Why are you making this a thing rooted in sexism? My partner has told me about his dad explaining to him how to properly wash his genitals. He had the same experience with new body hair growing in that I did. Children *need* to learn about their changing bodies and how to look after them. There is nothing wrong with a parent supporting their child through transitions, ‘firsts’, etc.\n\nI’m going to stop replying now. This is too much lol. You’re mad about flowers, comrade. Accept that perhaps the majority of people put less stock into plants than you do. You don’t need to buy your kid anything and no one is telling you to. You don’t have to like flowers. You just have to understand they aren’t scary for most people. Nice gestures don’t have to signify life changing events - they can just be nice.",

Personally, I don't see the blood as life-changing considering the fact that everything about you is the same. You're still allowed to like and dislike the same things. Your parents are still the same, you aren't suddenly going to change hair or eye color. You're still going to go to the same school tomorrow. You're still going to do the same extracurriculars. You're still going to have the same friends. Hell, you're still going to have your same pizza topping preference. Maybe we shouldn't be perpetuating the myth to our daughters that a period is a mystical thing that turns you into another person. Do we do the same thing for our sons for their nocturnal emissions?",

Certain bodily changes are happening but that doesn't mean that your kids suddenly can't play with LOL surprise dolls anymore, or hang out with her friends, or make slime, or any of the other things a child does. She isn't suddenly going to transform like a butterfly coming out of a cocoon. You put a pad on and then you go about your day, that's all.",
