    "post_text ": "I am 17, male. I got into an argument with my brother. He is a hothead. He grabbed his ps4 controller and broke it. My mother came to investigate and she discovered the controller crushed. And my brother said that I did that.\n\nMy parent's trust whatever he says. They gave him mine. \n\nMy father asked me to come into the living room. And he starts talking about how making money isn't easy and it just pulled a different thread, he started talking about my past, my bad grades, and other things I am not good at. He slapped me and continued doing that until my mom stopped him and told him about another. This triggered him more, he punched me in my stomach and my back. \n\nMy brother was watching all of this and he came forth and told the truth. My dad thought he was saying that to protect me. But he swore and started crying, which made them believe and they simply told him to go into his room. He told me to wash up because I smelled bad.\n\nMy parents were always like that to me, verbally abusive, but he never hit me that hard. \n\nI don't what is gonna happened next. I don't have guts to step out of my room. Things have never gotten this far. I need some help on what I should do next.",

I don't know what escalated him to physical violence but you don't know if it'll keep happening now.\n\nYou're close to 18, you don't deserve to be belittled or hit. My advice is report or get out.",

Good for my brother and sister, me, not so much. This is the same grandma that fucked up my dad so badly he actually parented as many of the actual narcisist parents described here. He's not a true narcisist, and while he never did a single dad-thing and pretty much only made us miserable with constant verbal abuse, he never did something like what OP described here. He'd just straight up say our mom would take care of stuff like bithdays, and she did. He still loved to ruin the party with a monologue about what worthless shitty children we were though. Took me years to understand why friends never wanted to play at our house, because they werent spared either.\n\nHowever, I have a suspicion that my friend's mom knew what was going on and provided me with a safe haven. My brother and sister were welcome there too. And before you go nuts and say she should have done more, this is actually the most anybody ever did for us where it concerns my father's \"parenting style\".  She never did say anything, I think because its inadvisable to shit on some kid's parents as an adult. I just suspect. I was so welcome there, it still baffles me sometimes. I never felt wanted or welcome at home. It made me terribly shy, even anxious, towards the parents of other kids.",

He was an unwanted child to a 16 year old mother in the seventies who was abandoned by her family because of his existence. She in turn was terribly abused by her father and brother, throughout her life before being kicked to the curb with a premature baby. Why she didn't give him up, I'll never know,  she's dead. That entire side of the family is toxic. Even I was toxic as a kid, because that behaviour was considered normal in the family. Thats was just the way we comnunicated, I didn't know any different, just like my father.\n\nThankfully my lightbulb turned on somewhere around the age of 10 and I realised I did not want to make others miserable, the exact opposite in fact, I feel a staggering need to take other people's pain away when they are hurting. Because I know what its like to hurt so badly in an emotional sense it becomes physical. Took some stumbling and some fuck ups, but I'm pretty sure I'm not toxic anymore. I hope...",

My sister is the golden child and until just recently, almost 15 years after my narcissistic parents last attack on me and I left home at 24, she didn’t realize how bad things were for me. She saw my mother beat me for hours and lock me up in a room to only later kiss my step-father’s feet as an apology for telling my sister I was her half sibling 10 years after my mother scared me into never mentioning this fact again. I was 21 then and it wasn’t till I was 33 that she finally realize what had been going on and the parts she played in it.\n\nSo no, it doesn’t matter the age, it rather matters the maturity level of the golden child. And unfortunately that only happens after that child has had the same experience and learnt firsthand what the scapegoat has been going through.\n\nTrust me, narcissism is a demonic mental illness. It doesn’t go down easily. And everyone involved in it is scared by it no matter their age. In fact, the younger they are the worse the long term effects.\n\nSo please call CPS and the police, if you live in the states, and leave ASAP. You are old enough that you may not get put into foster care but rather something worse. So find family or a friend who will let you stay while you finish school. Go to university, find means of getting the money for it and go. That is the foundation you need to get as far away from this illness as possible. Also find affordable therapy, you need it. But yeah, definitely take pictures of the bruises and make sure you file a case against your parents with the police. Even if they don’t take you seriously, make sure it’s on record for later use. You know your parents and you know how easily this could be turned on you to make you seem crazy.\n\nYou’ll be fine. I was you once and today at age 36 I’m finally getting my life back. I don’t doubt that there are others like me so you can be sure that your recovery will be faster. I didn’t have all these resources and stories to help me when I was trying to heal. I didn’t even know what I was experiencing so you are mikes ahead of me already. So don’t let my age scare you. I believe very strongly that you’ll recover faster.",

The brother will most likely lie on their behalf, so even with pictures, with no witnesses, there might be no case. Since you weren't hit before, there's probably no record of abuse or anything like that. Even if your parents aren't as bad as mine which they probably aren't, it is unlikely CPS is going to do much in this situation even without COVID. The most that will probably happen is that you will succeed in pissing your father off even more. My personal advice would be to wait until age 18, make sure you have birth certificate, drivers' license or state ID card, then leave that day and go full NC. Look up shelters in your area or talk to friends and have everything ready for that day. And in the meantime just lay low, and maybe avoid the brother. Also google the grey rock method.",

My mom was so upset, said that \"they made you so nice to your mommy\", referring to herself in the third person included.\n\n\nIt was one of the things that really fucked with my ability to seek medical help for my MDD, C-PTSD, and general anxiety, because I was terrified of being drugged into silence again.\n\n\nI'd also had a social worker that visited me at school twice a month after my parents' divorce.

Get a notebook and start writing detailed descriptions of what happened. Try to keep it factual and make sure you date each entry, and if there is physical abuse take pictures. Back up these pictures if you can.\n\nYou may want to post this in r/legaladvice, they will be able to help you immensely over there with legal questions and stuff if you decide to call the cops or CPS.\n\nYou can get through this okay?

It's easy to see an abuser as evil, because of what they do, especially if he is a parent abusing his kid. And if he's a narc, there simply isnt a cure or solution, narcs are friggin impossible to work with. So dont bother with them.\n\nVictimblaming is the absolute LAST thing we should do, I agree with that.\n\nI'm just trying to say that abuse has many forms and the people involved arent simply the good guy and the bad guy.\n\nFor example: If there is a couple where one abuses the other, BOTH of them need help and tools to change this downward spiralling pattern. The abuser won't change on his own, perhaps you dont even want to bother with them. But in my experience, most people who suffer abuse want the abuse to stop, but not the relationship. This is why children of abusive parents often remain loyal to some degree. I am one of those children.\n\nMy dad was an awful father and systematically destroyed my confidence and self image, and yet, I cannot bear the thought of severing all ties. Its not as simple as it sounds. Even though I am still damaged by it 10 years after leaving home.",

This is a very unhealthy lifestyle and if it goes on it could possibly end badly. From every parent they will always use outdated ways of punishment. I think its time to show baby boomers, Gen X's and Gen Y's that beating your children just makes the problem worse and can potentially end up bad for the child. Sorry got of topic, anyways talking to your parents about this situation is a good idea\n\nOption #2: Call CPS. Even though you still only have about a year till your an adult, CPS will take you under their wing as you are still a minor. However this is last because I have heard pretty scary stories of people being taken by CPS. However if Option #1 fails, this is your last option...\n\nHey Man I really hope you do get some help. Mabey you should see a therapist to discuss the problems your having, It worked for me when I had depression.",

You deserve to be happy, you deserve to be safe. You are endangered where you currently are. Your father attacked you , he should be in jail, like most attackers are. If you dont do anything, you will regret it later in life.

Its so common in trauma and abuse survivors to protect their abusers, especially since the abuser is their parent.
