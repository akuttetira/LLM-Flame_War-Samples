I also told them I was going to a different place than where I’m at. \n\nI can go outside whenever I want. I don’t have to walk on eggshells. I can exist. \n\nIn the mornings I wake up peacefully and then I go for a walk along the ocean. \n\nI can breathe. Life is good.\n\nedit: Ahhh thank you so much everyone for the sweet comments and the awards, I am holding space in my heart for all of you <3",

So it is good to be aware and have a plan to call police for trespassing, keep doors/windows locked, in case the narcissist decides to do a pop-in. Or move frequently. Not sure how celebrities keep their addresses private. It would be good to know.\n\nThis all is not said to diminish the need to celebrate OPs Freedom!!!\nCongrats to OP!!! <3 Nicely done!!!",
