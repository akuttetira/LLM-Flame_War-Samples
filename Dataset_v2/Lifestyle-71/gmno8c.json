    "Post_Title": "Dad told me I'm \"Not allowed to move out.\"",
    "post_text ": "After telling my parents a few weeks ago that I'm moving in with my best friend (for only $450 a month might I add), my parents were completely against it. Well of course they would be, they're the reason I'm moving out. While I am gonna have to pay rent paycheck-to-paycheck, I'll do what it takes to get away from here. I even graduated college one year early to move out earlier. Plus, I've paid off all my student loans and have no outstanding debt. I finally am free to work on myself, and stop letting their abuse, trauma, and manipulation determine what's best for me.\n\nWell my dad called me yesterday saying how he's so glad I'm not moving out, because \"It was a dumbass, bonehead idea. I'd ruin my life if I did.\" Funny, because I never said I'm not moving out. He's still confident I need them in my life and am staying. I didn't say a word while he was speaking, and just let him keep going with his manipulation. \"Plus, me and your mother are putting our foot down. You're not allowed to move out now.\"\n\nExcuse me? I'm 1000% positive I don't need your permission. I'm 21, can sign a lease on my own, and wasn't ASKING to move out. I was TELLING. It's not your decision, it's mine.\n\nEdit: Wow, thank you all SO SO much for your love, kind words and support!! I did not expect this post to blow up like it did, but I appreciate every single bit of advice. I've read every comment, and I definitely feel much more reassured that I'm not just some crazy, young 21 year old moving out too early. You're all amazing, incredible people! Thank you for sharing your stories. I will definitely keep you posted.\n\nUpdate 6/5:\nI'm not moving out. My father threatened to leave my mother, said he's taking my car, insurance, and basically everything they've ever given to me away if I leave the house. My mother can't afford a mortgage on her own. There's been constant fights. I feel broken. I'm stuck here for at least another year.\n\nUpdate 6/17:\nHey everyone, I wanted to let you know I'm doing much much better. Honestly, I sat down and had a FANTASTIC talk with my parents. This has never happened before lol. Things are doing much better in my house ever since, and honestly, I'm really happy. They truly are respecting me as an individual after the deep talk we've had where I literally poured out my feelings of their manipulation and poor parenting choices. My household is still nowhere near perfect, but my parents have recognized their poor treatment towards me and each other, and are working on repairing it. I am religious, and owe it. toGod for softening their hearts and being open to my feelings. I did want to add that I have gotten a lot of disrespectful messages and assumptions about my family. I want to say first and foremost, my parents are not monsters. Yes, there have been many abusive and difficult times, but I still truly love them and do not appreciate the disgusting messages I've received about them. Next, I wanted to say I would like to close this thread. I'm in a safe space (emotionally and physically) and have come to terms that I have to wait just one more year.\n\nThank you for all of your help.",

My friends who didn't have a controlling/verbally abusive parent growing up didn't understand why I didn't just \"move out anyway, you're an adult\". It is a very difficult thing to do, and you have my respect.\n\nBest wishes.",

It is understandable and very, very hard to make the move away from your parents, especially when they have been a very prominent controlling force in your life. I am proud of you, no matter what happens after you move out.\n\nEven if you end up struggling for a bit, you didn't fail. You will succeed. Stay firm in your decision, and have confidence.\n\nGood luck",

And the fear it might be true can often overwhelm the part of you saying it isn't true.\n\nWe aren't staying because we want to. We stay because we struggle to take the first steps out.\n\nNote: this is not the exact experience of all of us, but it is mine and I know I am not the only one",

It is a process, and I have no idea how long it takes to finish, if ever. Don't expect that moving out will necessarily mean sunshine and daisies forever.\n\nDon't be mad or disappointed in yourself if your parents' voices come creeping back.

However when I got myself out the door, at least I could control more things including not listening to that crap.  I was low contact for many many years (40) My mistake was not going full NC right off the bat.  I just prolonged the agony of listening to all this negative stuff.\n\nBack to basics---my first motivation was to escape in any way possible.  Anything had to be better, and it was...even living next door to someone where they tried to break the neighbor's door down with an ax.  I guess for me the most important thing is to get away.  You have the rest of your life to thing about not making it!!! Seriously.  Once you get away your thinking will taking a big leap toward clarity.",
