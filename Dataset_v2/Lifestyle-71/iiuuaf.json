    "Post_Title": "My sexually abusive nStep-dad got arrested yesterday",
    "post_text ": "Basically, the title. He sexually abused me from the age of 10-19. I reported him to the police almost 1 year ago now, and after a lengthy investigation, he is in police custody at this moment.\n\nI was not expecting the call from the detevtive telling me my step-father was in police custody yesterday, and all I could think when he told me was, \"Oh my god. I have to tell my brother [who he physically and emotionally abused].\" \n\nI feel like I'm finally getting some justice and closure for what happened to me. This man ruined my life, and he's gotten away with it for so long. Well, no longer. This week, the victims earned a victory.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for the awards and support! I may not be able to reply to every comment, but I have read them all and I genuinely appreciate your messages of support.\n\nTo those of you who have shared your own stories, both on my post and in their own, I want you to know that you deserve all of the genuine love and affection that your abusers and nParents have denied you. You are a beautiful human being, and I hope every one of you is able to get the closure and peace that you need.\n\nI promised to update when I found out if my nStep-father was going to be kept in police custody or released with conditions, so here's that update.\n\nHe has been released, with a laundry list of conditions. Those conditions are:\n\n•No contact with me or [other victim who testified (hereafter OV)], directly or indirectly.\n\n•Except as specified, no being within 200ft of me or [OV], or anywhere that we can reasonably be expected to be (home, school, work, place of worship, etc).\n\n•No weapons (he can use tools he needs for his job when he's working and utensils needed for eating, but beyond that, he is not allowed to have anything that could be defined as a weapon in his possession).\n\n•No contact with any child under age of 16, except with parent/guardian supervision. This includes his grandchildren.\n\n•No seeking employment or volunteer positions that involve being in a position of power or authority over children under 16. He typically volunteers with his community theater, and he teaches young children at his church. Both of those are now completely off limits.\n\n•No public parks or swimming areas, or anywhere that children under 16 can reasonably be expected to be present. \n\nFurther, the police service in the area that my abuse took place is going to make a media release asking for any other victims to come forward and make statements. They hope that if more victims make statements, they can add more charges to the case against him.\n\nAs it stands, he has 6 charges against him: 3 counts of Sexual Interference under section 151 of the Criminal Code of Canada, 1 count of Sexual Exploitation under section 153 of the CCC, and 2 counts of Sexual Assault under section 173 of CCC.\n\nI'll continue to update as court dates begin and the case goes forward.\n\nTo those of you sitting on the fence about reporting your abuse or assault, please, please report. You never know what kind of difference you can make to your life and someone else's life.",

I genuinely appreciate that.\n\nMy hope is to see him behind bars, never in a position to hurt other girls again.\n\nBecause of him, I have struggled with maintaining normal, healthy relationships. I can't have a full-time job because of the anxiety and depression his actions directly caused.\n\nI have been in therapy for 6 years now, and I can feel myself growing and healing in every session. I genuinely hope that getting justice will help me continue the process.\n\nI have a case worker who has supported me through this process, and she's encouraging me to write a book after all is said and done. I think that that will help me heal as well, to put my life on paper and share it with the world.\n\nI want to let every victim of abuse know that they are strong, and they deserve justice. They deserve to be heard. Most of all, they deserve love and everything that their abusers have denied them.",

Thank you for posting it.\n\nI thought I’d offer this perspective: Human pieces of shit who do things like your stepfather did/does are rare. I’m not saying they’re not real and I will say that even one of them existing is too many. But my point is that the vast majority of people aren’t like that. So I hope you’re able to find a high quality person to trust and love. And I’d say the odds are stacked heavily in your favor. Good luck to you.",
