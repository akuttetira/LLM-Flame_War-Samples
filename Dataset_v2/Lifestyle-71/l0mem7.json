    "post_text ": "I distinctly remember my parents telling me as a kid that I would “see when I was a parent” and (I guess) understand them more.  Well, I’ve been one for over 14 years (twice) and I don’t “see” anything except they were not in a good place to parent anyone. And I am happy to report I have no inclination to abuse, control, or diminish my own children. You don’t have to become them.\n\nUPDATE: Wow. I didn’t expect all these responses.  I have been coming in here more as I unpack my feelings and I applaud this community for being so resilient, introspective, and self-aware that you lead the examined life which is not too common these days. Thanks for all the feedback- it’s very meaningful to me.  I enjoy the insights I get from here and the occasional outlet to vent when I don’t have a place to fall.  I love that so many people are out there working to be better than they were taught. I’ll sleep well tonight. Thank you. Xo",

A lock is simply a boundary protecting our private & quiet space. It ensures no one can just barge in unannounced and gives us control over who/when someone can enter our personal space. The lock itself provides a feeling of security. It doesn’t mean the child is doing anything wrong. The same way I’m sure there are times you want to lock your door when your kids are home. Sometimes we all just need personal space and quiet time and the lock ensures that.\n\nEdit: Sorry if I misinterpreted your comment. I’m just trying to say even if your kids locked their doors it wouldn’t be a personal dig or statement against you. The lock just might make them feel safe",

I spent all of my time in the library or my room until I was old enough to work (9) and I did everything I could to be as invisible as possible. She was sending me away for the summer every year because \"she just couldn't deal with my behavior.\" She sent me to live with the family member that she knew was molesting me when she got pregnant with my sister and I ended up staying with him for a year.\n\nThey had an easy kid. They had a good kid. Your parents have no clue what an amazing kid you were. I've never met a kid I didn't like (well unless their parents completely fucked them up), and even that can be fixed once you get through their walls. Once they realize that you are an adult who can be trusted.",

My daughter is 14 still doesn't hate me and we are all ok. But I don't invade her privacy, I don't read every message in her phone and then make fun of her for it, I don't read her diary. As long as we have no concerns then I don't need to know what little boy she is crushing on or anything like that. 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️",
