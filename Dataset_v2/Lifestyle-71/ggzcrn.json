I, personally, have had my parents buy me things I never wanted and then expected to be worshipped because of how expensive those unwanted things were.\n\nWhen any money spent on you is considered a waste by your parents, and any money you spend on them is never enough; it’s fairly easy to see how someone could come to resent money and material goods being valued over homemade presents or other expressions of love.\n\nIf your dad was a mean drunk when you were a kid, would you have a strong opinion on alcohol abuse? If this person hated Communism because of their narcissistic parents would you still correct them on who deserves the blame?\n\nInvalidating someone’s values based on their life experiences is gross. Telling someone who or what is to blame because they mentioned your personal sacred cow isn’t supportive or helpful. It’s like you literally stopped reading when the word “capitalism” was used to admonish OP. Just....gross.",
