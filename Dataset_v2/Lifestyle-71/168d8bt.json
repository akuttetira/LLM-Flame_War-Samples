    "Post_Title": "Husband almost killed my daughter's friend and I'm just sick over it",
    "post_text ": "We had a family beach day planned today and my daughter wanted to bring one of her best friends with us. We don't really know this girl but were willing to bring her along. We pulled up to her house and my daughter goes to the door then comes back to the car with the friend. My daughter climbed in first and started helping her friend into the van. At this time, my husband is distracted over a missing iPhone charger. He starts to pull away from the curb while the friend is still climbing into the car, dragging her several feet before he realized what he did. He slams on the breaks and gets out, apologizing profusely. He was used to just having the 4 kids in the car and instinctively pulled away after our daughter got in. The friend is okay overall, she just scraped her ankle, thank God. The girl's mother saw the whole thing and is understandably distraught. She comes outside screaming at my husband as he is  a puddle of apology. The whole neighborhood starts to look over at the scene. Obviously the mother said the girl was now staying home, and we left after apologizing again and again. \n\nMy daughter is understandably devastated and no longer wanted to go, so I came home with her. She is humiliated and so am I, and I feel awful for her and her friend. She knows that everyone at school will know what happened and is dreading the first day. She also thinks this will be the end of tbeir friendship. I also feel bad for my other kids who are obviously shaken up by the whole scene. \n\nMy husband took the rest of the kids to the beach, despite feeling terrible about what he did. He is generally a very smart man with a wonderful heart, especially for kids, and I love him dearly, but he really can be an oaf. I'm angry that he can be so complacent sometimes and goes on autopilot way too often. He feels bad enough about what happened so I can't vent this to him, and I know that if I did something stupid he'd be right there in my corner, so I had to vent it somewhere. I'm so mad, but I can't direct it at him. I need a way to make it up to that girl and her family, and to my daughter. I'm sorry, I'm just so sick and angry right now and have no one to vent to about it.",
