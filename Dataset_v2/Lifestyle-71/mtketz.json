    "post_text ": "I saw a post earlier about someone who got into an Ivy League school despite having a narcissistic mom. That’s an amazing achievement and anyone who can get close to that should be immensely proud.\n\nIt’s also important to acknowledge the people who had parents that did everything they could to make them fail. Personally, it was my dream to go to an Ivy League school too, since I was about 13. I took the hardest classes, worked as hard as I could, studied as much as possible, did everything to spite my nmom who’s mission was to see me fail. \n\nBut it didn’t matter. I was a depressed, broken teenager sneaking out of the house to buy food with money from a job my mom didn’t know I had. I didn’t have time to study math or science when I was calming down my screaming family members into the early hours of the morning, or calming my mom down from her nightly tantrums. You can’t make it to all of your classes when your parents “ground you” from going to school.\n\n\nThe truth is, it’s a shitty system. The idea that so much success is determined by your ability to thrive before you’re even 18 is insane. Some of us are born into mansions; and some of us are born into abuse. You are loved.",

It's lovely to hear that you've overcome a lot of these advantages, but it's also important to be considerate to those who have had different journeys and to make sure we're showing empathy towards them right now. Most people don't even realize their situation is abusive and not normal until many years later, sometimes well into their 30s, 40s and 50s. Some people might have access to these practical resources, but they might have developed crippling depression or anxiety from their abuse, and don't even know what their career goals are from being so restricted. Some are held back by guilt, or a feeling of obligation towards their abuser. Many don't have a support system in their extended family or friends to take on these roles for them.\n\nThere is no deadline for healing, and right now, this is a moment to support those people who have had longer healing journeys - to remind them that, even if they didn't achieve an Ivy League University or take advantage of all the resources that were available to them (due to either lack of knowledge or lack of motivation with depression/mental illnesses or lack of a support system), they are still worthy. It's amazing that you discovered that this version of success was still accessible to you and I'm certain it wasn't easy, but it isn't great to imply that this version of career success is available to all. This is especially when you recognize that your support system (of at least 4 adults) and your ability to display some level of self love and motivation were essential in this journey. This is a support group, so people are not always looking for tips - most people have already lived these experiences, and are looking for validation and comfort.",

Sometimes we can have good intentions and think that we're helping, when we're indeed hurting - unfortunately, the original comment does tread the line on toxic positivity and includes certain values like prioritizing material value (getting into a certain kind of university) over the mental and emotional well being of abuse victims, and is clearly not taking into consideration the fact that most of our victims have already passed the point of being 18 and aren't necessarily looking for tips on how to get into Ivy League schools.\n\nAgain, sharing your personal experiences is totally okay. But every abuse victim has a very unique and individual journey. Assuming your experience applies to others' journeys or that you know what's best for their healing is not super appropriate.",

A comment doesn't need to be entirely bad to warrant a removal, sometimes one badly worded sentence is enough to make it triggering or hurtful. You're free to edit the comment focusing on your own experiences without speaking for others (without using sentences like \"what *we* can to do\", \"what *we* need to realize\", and say things more along the lines of \"what was important for *me* in *my* journey*\"*, etc.).\n\nIf you'd still like to contest this removal, please use modmail so we don't continue to derail this discussion for OP.",
