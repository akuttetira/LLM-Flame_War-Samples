    "post_text ": "Delete if not allowed but I'm really interested in this subs views of cancel culture. Mainly on how many view it \"going too far\" when they blame it for pushing their fave content creators off the platforms they initially succeeded on. I've seen many people discuss this as it relates to Jenna Marbles most recently, but I'm of the opinion that if people choose to leave platforms because of backlash over things they have done, they're more than welcome to do so but that it's privileged to just exit a platform as opposed to truly facing the music and sharing their growing journey with their fans.\n\nI think accountability and cancel culture are getting confused. I especially think that POCs/women/minorities/etc are under no obligation to \"forgive\" content creators who have done things historically that may be harmful to their communities. Personally I'm not interested in seeing a blogger or influencer learn and grow from their mistakes, because to be honest there are much better people to support that aren't problematic in the first place. If they grow, that's cool. But I'm not necessarily a fan of forcing people to forgive someone they have no obligation to do that for. I think that being a public figure includes a ton of accountability and exposure that a \"normal\" person doesn't get, but that is a part of putting yourself out on a public platform unfortunately.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

Guess what, you just lost your job and your kids are getting death threats.\n\nThe people getting dragged on social media are being more than rude. I don’t agree with or condone the death threats, but when you’re deliberately putting a black mans life in danger by saying you’re going to call the police on a black man (in Central Park nonetheless), you’re bringing that on yourself, cause Emmett Till didn’t die from the flu. Or when that attorney was screaming at two Hispanic women who were speaking Spanish.\n\nWe live in the day and age of cameras. If it weren’t for cameras we wouldn’t have George Floyd’s murder on camera. Any Cooper may have very well gotten that black man arrested or killed because of her tears.\n\nThere’s having a bad day and then there’s just being an ass for the world to end up seeing",

Spoiler alert: it doesn't). And yeah I dont even want to get into the shitstorm that is YA novel Twitter where people exploit wokeness to bully readers or authors they feel threatened by.\n\n\nBut most of the videos of \"normal people\" that go viral are often of people acting racist, its more than being rude. I doubt many people would believe the man in the Amy Cooper encounter had it not been for him making that video or many of the countless other instances of white women harrasing POC, even children, for racist reasons. The greater narrative in our culture has been that POC pull the \"racism card\" too quickly and that white women, especially privileged ones, are often seen as potential victims of POC, especially MOC, rather than the aggressors. The videos are more than anything a means of protection so that there is a clear record of the real story.",

If some random person has a bad day and acts like an asshole and it gets filmed, it is not \"justice\" to have the internet doxx said person and try to ruin their life by sharing it to public platforms.  That's just nasty, evil, and uncalled for.

That was a time in ALL our lives in our 20s where we were tanning EXTREMELY. If she was doing black face so were all the kids of Jersey Shore. So was every white girl that got a brown spray tan back then. She even showed the end of the clip where she was sans wig, no longer impersonating Nicki Minaj and just looked... really tan.\n\nI hope I’m never judged for anything I said in my early 20’s because lord knows I probably slut shamed some women and dealt with some inner mysogyny because I literally didn’t know you could think any other way. We were brainwashed into thinking slut shaming was perfectly acceptable. Entire dating shows were created on TV around the idea. It pervaded our entire culture.\n\nThe fact that her other ‘racist’ video were lyrics that literally called the line itself out FOR BEING RACIST makes it as self aware as anyone who’s done a comedy bit and used an accent not from their culture in a joke. I’m glad she’s taking responsibility but I truly don’t think it’s warranted to cancel her. Jenna makes some of the most wholesome content on the internet & that is SO needed right now.",

It’s a learning moment.\nWhen you said that you hope people have never judged you for saying anything ignorant? How lucky to worry about that. Think of how different it must be for the people who experience judgement for just... being. If you do something shitty, you apologise. If people bring you up on your past comments then it won’t be anyone’s fault but yours for saying them in the first place.",

FWIW, some of my black friends would tan too...it was Florida and almost everyone did do it back then. If her incorrect assumption is offensive to you, I trust you don’t say or laugh at “[certain race of] people be like...” jokes - because every single one of those is an incorrect assumption.\n\nSaying “you realize not everyone is white?” is obviously sarcastic, because surely the commenter does realize this.\n\n“You do realize 2+1=3, right?” Would that seem bitchy if an acquaintance said that to you in real life? YES.",
