    "post_text ": "mods, just take it down if it has no place here, I just need to get it off my chest, and don't know where to post.\n\nAnd I can't stop trembling, because this has brought up forgotten memories of Ndad towering ove me, hitting me, pushing me against walls, holding me down.\n\nBut I'm proud of me, because I called the police and they came and the trouble has stopped. Not sure if they have taken him away, I was curled in a ball on the sofa by the time they came around, could'nt look. But I did something for that woman and her kid.\n\nIt's not much, and it could lead to more problems for her, but I tried.\n\nThe neighbourhood is silent now, and I'm curled in a ball with the covers tightly around me sipping hot tea, picking a mind bleach netflix program.\n\nI'm glad I did something. This emotional flashback mess was worth it.\n\nETA 3 hours later : wow this has really blown up! Thanks for all the support and nice messages and awards! I have no news about the neighbours, and it's very silent over there since I called. I'd usually hear the kid playing around the house, so I'm hoping the abusive POS was taken in, and she left with the kids, but I can't be sure. Keeping my fingers crossed for them. Still shaking from time to time, but the silence is reassuring me that I did the right thing. Something definitely changed over there.\n\nedit 2: 6 hours after original post: Someone's back in the house, I hear some running around and cupboards opened and closed, I hope it's the wife and kid packing, but let's not get our hopes too high.",
