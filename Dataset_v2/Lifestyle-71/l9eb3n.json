It is super hard to get up and get going, but once you do it gets easier because you get positive reinforcement.\n\nOf course, I'm totally screwed up right now with the covid situation, but once it's over it's just a matter of putting the work in to get back to being ok. I recommend starting with a group relating to a hobby. Then you just casually go talk about the hobby and eventually become full friends, less pressure than specifically trying to \"meet people.\"\n\nWith a bit of luck and more hard work is fair, you can find a place to belong and people who really love you.",

If it helps at all, abuse tends to warp your understanding of reality and set up mental barriers where no physical ones exist. I hope you can find some support to help ease the burden and get to a place of wellness, but I know from first hand experience how horribly difficult and unfair to have to slog through that kind of pain.\n\nI don't know your situation, but speaking for myself and many others, things improve considerably when you are able to put physical and emotional distance between yourself and the narcs. If you haven't been able to do that yet, it's a change that's worth holding out for.",
