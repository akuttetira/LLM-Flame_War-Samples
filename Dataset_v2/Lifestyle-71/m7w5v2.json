    "Post_Title": "My Doctor Finally Said It. I Feel So Validated!",
    "post_text ": "I  had a doctor's appointment to inform her I was recently bitten by a  brown recluse spider. I went to the hospital and things were dealt with,  but I was just informing her. I asked her (as I have before), not to tell my mother. Keep in mind I'm in my thirties, but I have a paranoia about my mother asking questions, and persisting.   \n\n\nAnd, she's... very convincing.   \n\n\nMy doctor said, of course, she wouldn't. And after some brief conversation about the bite on my upper, inner thigh -- that I was taking my antibiotics, warm compresses, and taking baths, etc, and keeping an eye on it to make sure the swelling didn't go past the marker, blah-blah-blah...   \n\n\nShe and I started talking about my mother.   \n\n\nDuring this conversation, she very casually said that my mother was a narcissist and it was very obvious to her. To make sure I took my antianxiety meds before we meet up with them for the first time in nine months so that I wouldn't get triggered. I've been sober since December 18th, and she told me that she was proud of me that I'd gone so long without seeing her and that my mother was obviously a big trigger for my drinking.\n\n\n**SHE SAID IT. SHE ACTUALLY SAID IT.**   \n\n***She said that my mother was a narcissist.*** \n\n***That is was obvious.***  \n\n\nIt just... felt so... **SO VALIDATING.** I honestly feel like I could cry tears of relief. That a professional, a doctor, after all this time, **FINALLY** said it.\n\nEDIT: The harrassment I received from a 'psychology student' at the end of this, despite asking her to stop commenting repeatedly really made me miserable and feel invalidated after posting. I'm going to go to bed as I need my rest. Tomorrow is going to be a hard day as I have to make contact with my mother and father for the first time after eight/nine months of No Contact.\n\nEDIT 2: I got some support in my PMs which cheered me up, then someone PM'd me trying to sound threatening, and sneering at me but it just came across as oddly sexual and funny so I'm back in my high spirits again because I couldn't stop laughing at it: 'You're a bad little brat, your mother is just concerned about your health!''\n\nOooh such a bad little brat! LOL Spank me!",

My doctor and I had a discussion about it later on, and we both ended up realizing what my mother had done. Due to suffering from C-PTSD, PTSD, my doctor believed I was much more in confidence with my mother than I was (I was on disability for a period of time). I felt if I had nothing nice to say, I shouldn't say it at all.\n\nEventually, after this experience, I confided in my doctor that my mother was Satan incarnate and to never tell her anything on 'my behalf' ever again. She knew she'd done wrong, but I never reported her for it. It made our bond stronger and put us in unison against my mother ever so gently.\n\nMy doctor realized she'd been manipulated, and could've lost her license. And it would've been my mother who'd brought that down upon her -- I know the doctor is really to blame, but I know my mother. She's VERY manipulative. VERY convincing.\n\nEDIT: So now I remind her almost every other phone call not to tell my mother anything we discuss.",

(A harried nurse or admin might just literally go with “my child” and not see really look at the chart)\n* I’m so worried!  I swear I’m going to faint from anxiety.\n* I won’t tell them—you know I won’t—so it’s okay.  And it will be our secret.\n* If I don’t know how sick my child is, what will I tell my grandchildren?\n* That’s old paperwork—I’m really supposed to be approved\n* Please just check one more time—I’m sure that i’m supposed to make this decision.\n* The husband/wife/SO is so upset—I’m sure it will be okay if I handle this.  See?  I’m helping.\n* they are so unreasonable—don’t they love their mother?  You love your mother right?  You wouldn’t do this to your mother.\n* Honor your mother and father!\n* I am more family than you are—I’ve known him/her since birth!\n* They aren’t really married\n\nThen there’s hoovering and love bombing: you’re so kind to an old woman, you don’t know how worried I’ve been, and I haven’t slept a wink because my poor baby is so sick so can’t you please tell me?\n\nHonestly, most of the time, they have the technical piece of paper, but it doesn’t stop a mistake or a really green nurse from goofing up and giving out information.  It’s actually fairly recent that they’ve really been dropping the hammer on privacy rights and that’s because someone somewhere got sued into oblivion.  Particularly in small towns where the narcissist knows a lot of people and can leverage a connection, then team it up with calling a hundred times “I want to speak to your manager” and it can be a hotbed of loose lips.  Someone going “well, I have my boss breathing down my neck to get this maniac off the phone” coupled with “it won’t hurt to just say this little bit”....",

Pathologizing might be unhealthy if their behavior is not actually pathological, but identifying unhealthy patterns of behavior and having suspicions is not problematic at all. If anything, being capable of recognizing unhealthy behavior is the first step to addressing it. OP also clarified this was an opinion provided by somebody who did indeed treat her for many years and has the proper training for this - without having this person as your patient for a long time, as well, you don't get to deny that diagnosis. Being a psych student doesn't mean you get to tell others who was and wasn't abused, and it gives you no special authority here.\n\nPlease also remember to always assume a context of abuse here. You might not like the concept in a general sense, but it is one of our rules within the group. This is a support group for abuse victims - if you feel like you can't support OP, it's best to move onto another post. Being a psych student doesn't mean you get to use a support group to question abuse victims' experiences here and break our rules. You've been given a temporary ban for harassing OP on this issue.",

If this person isn’t failing they should’ve known what they said was extremely harmful to a victim, and the fact it was entirely based on their own assumptions is even worse.\n\nI don’t want you to feel like you shouldn’t trust your gp. Maybe if this had been a single consult then sure it would’ve been inappropriate, even so that clearly wasn’t her point but was rather that your mother is a trigger and to keep up your anxiety meds. She clearly has your best interests in mind.\n\nYou never make another persons hardships or successes about you. Nobody is perfect, they will say harsh or incorrect things, we are taught to be understanding of that, and not to do it in return. A class this person clearly skipped.\n\n“It really grinds my gears.” Is not something they should’ve ever said to you regarding your own feelings.\n\nI wish you the best and hope you can continue to recover and be your best.",
