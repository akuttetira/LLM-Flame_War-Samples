    "Post_Title": "HobbySnark: Erin Condren, one of the biggest and most powerful #PlannerBabes and makers is CANCELLED",
    "post_text ": "Erin Condren is a huge, huge part of the planner community. Her items aren't really my style, but anyone who is involved in the planner community knows who she is. \n\nEdit: What is the \"planner community\"? \n\nThere's a whole marketplace (mostly through craft and hobby stores) for paper planners---that use stickers, markers, and other papercraft items to decorate a specific planner. Mostly for fun and as a hobby. \n\nThe \"planner community\" is people who specifically call planning (meaning the process of creating paper planner pages) a hobby or even a job, as there are tons of Youtube, IG, and FB \"influencers\" in this space. There's even a conference, \"Go Wild\", every year! \n\n(From \"Distractify\" article) [Article Link](https://www.distractify.com/p/erin-condren-controversy)\n\n\"She went from being a stay-at-home mom to building a multi-million dollar brand from the ground up, and now, she's one of the biggest names in the planner community. Erin Condren, a mother of four, has been adored and labeled an inspiration by countless fans since her business took off. But now, it looks like everyone's favorite planner guru is in hot water.\" \n\nIn short: she used a BLM march as a chance to conceal a graduation gathering for her twins who were graduating high school with her own \"BLM\" (?) march **and very publicly talked about it on social media!**\n\nTo be frank I'm not sure this is...\"racism\" as it's being shorthand described as, but it IS misconduct, and using protests to your advantage, hugely racially tone deaf, entitled and clueless. \n\nAs the article explains \n\n\"The experience [of previous BLM marches] apparently helped spark the idea of creating a new \"march\" so that the seniors could party together. So at 6:30 p.m., an hour after the graduation ceremony, hundreds of seniors flooded Pier Plaza in downtown Hermosa, still sporting their caps and gowns. To make matters even worse, they didn't practice social distancing, and many were not wearing a mask. \n\nKate said: \"We hugged. We cried. I cried.\"\n\nCountless fans are now canceling Erin Condren for exploiting the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nA lot of fans are disappointed in Erin for doing something so insensitive and hurtful, especially in a time when the Black community is calling for help. She and her family basically used their privilege to abuse the freedom to protest, and the fact that they carelessly gathered without using caution in a pandemic is a big shock to many.\"\n\nI first found this out by popping on IG after a few days off and saw that multiple people I follow were addressing these actions in their stories or posts.\n\nThe planner community has several \"faces\": the conventional side of planning is more on the Happy Planner and Erin Condren side, but there's also a side of indie planners, as well as many niche-style planner makers and sticker makers. I personally don't engage much with the \"big\" planner and sticker makers, but this is rippling through the planner community and thought it was worth bringing up in case there are any other hashtag plannerbabes in the blogsnark community. \n\nThis is not the only \"hobby drama\" to come out of the community, but this move (of cancelling such a highly visible and powerful brand) is big and dramatic!",

            "Reply_Text": "Why every time there is a discussion about the planner community people seem to be shitting on the hobby? It's everyone's prerogative how they choose to spend their time. If someone wants to write \"get coffee\" in a pen in a planner and add a sticker to it, why does it trigger so many negative responses and blown minds?\n\nFrom the top of my head I don't understand Disneybounding, reborn dolls, collecting wine corks, painting nails with elaborate designs and stamping them or whatever or playing DnD, but I would never come to someone and said: \"Hey Kelsie, so you dress up as a princess and go to Disney? Three times a month? And spend money on custom ears, yearly pass AND you have a custom Disney phone case? You know what, that is pretty pathetic and juvenile. Why would not having a regular headband and phone case will be enough? It's a tool of efficiency, not art!\"\n\nJust fairly rude and entitled to judge how people spend their free time and money because YOU don't see a value in it.",
