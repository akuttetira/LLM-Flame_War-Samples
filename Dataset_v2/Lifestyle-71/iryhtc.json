Fortunately I'm getting moved to a foster family permanently.\n\nShe had me cut as a baby and she's always brought up how I had it done twice, I guess she didn't like it and found a doctor who would fix the original cut to the point where it got botched. Always had this weird fascination with me liking girls needing to be a good boy and treat girls with respect and she'd make sure I'd look my best. even harder now that my sister is having a baby boy and won't get it done and mom is flipping over it.\n\nThe other day she found a phone I bought for myself and lo and behold, there was my boyfriend. Now that she's past her denial phase, she's a victim. Me being gay and the thought of me having gay sex is unnatural, not how it's supposed to be, etc you know the drill. And my dad got in on it and they agreed.. i shouldn't even do it in the butt with a girl because that's unnatural too, it's not physically correct? \n\nAfter all she's done for me, all the consideration and time she's thrown away, how she chucked away so much money to get it done not once but twice and had to take care if it and hear me scream, so things could be sexually right for me and my girlfriends? And now I turn around and decide to be gay? And that gays don't deserve everything she did? I hadthe botch confirmed, and now I deserve all of it?\n\nLmao sure. Only one of many stories",

And we could cut off all your toes and you'd never have to worry about athlete's foot (bonus, never stub a toe again!). Or we could cut off your ears and you'd never have to wash behind them. What a time saver!\n\nOr the newer version \"It prevents some STD's.\"\n\nNo, it doesn't. It very slightly reduces the risk of getting a few of the minor ones. Know what reduces the risk by a LARGE amount? Proper sex-ed! Access to condoms! Seriously, why would you want something that creates a 5% reduction in a particular STD and violates a person's rights at the same time, when you could just TEACH the people things and get like a 70% reduction WHILE empowering them?  Oh, that's right. Because empowering them is the OPPOSITE of what you want.\n\nOr the OLD argument from a decade ago, that it prevents urinary tract infections in infant boys. Well, okay, but how about we treat boys' UTIs the way we treat girls' UTIs first, which is remarkably simple: step 1 is WAIT for the UTI to happen in the first place. Step 2 is an antibiotic, and maybe a change in diet if that's age-appropriate, and step 3 is to mutilate their genitals OH WAIT NO IT'S NOT. Genital mutilation is nowhere on the list of things to do to treat or prevent UTIs in girls. Yeah, it looks like jumping straight to \"cut off half the nerve endings in the penis\" is especially reserved for parents (and unethical doctors) asserting control over boys. At least in western cultures.\n\nAnyway, I'm done.\n\n\nedit: not done. Adding on to my anti- \"it prevents STDs\" rant, Also, if STDs are the reason that you're wanting to cut off erogenous tissue from someone else, shouldn't they be old enough to make a SOMEWHAT informed decision about this by the time the decision becomes relevant? Anyone old enough to worry about STDs is old enough to make some decision about what happens to their genitals... or conversely, anyone NOT old enough to make their own decisions about their genitals should NOT be having to worry about STDs.",

(to the best of my knowledge majority of Europe and Canada do not circumcise) also, if circumcision is so great at reducing the risk of AIDS why were there so many AIDS cases in California?",

And what that means is that they've shown NO causality, nor have they put forward a hypothetical method for any causality to work. And they base the statements regarding AIDS on a few VERY flawed studies conducted in sub-saharan africa, so in addition to being not relevant to the USA in terms of disease prevalance, nor in terms of the culture in which circumcision would be \"used\", they ALSO did some things that absolutely exaggerated the effect, to the point that those things could BE the ENTIRE effect.\n\nSo that's just it. It's dishonesty. Plain and simple. They want parents to control their kids' penises, and they don't care how much they have to lie to do it, or how many bad-faith arguments they have to put forward.\n\nI've actually come up with a way to tell if someone *actually, in good faith* thinks that circumcision is not harmful, and that it is appropriate to do to an infant, in the way that it is done in the USA.\n\nIt's simple. Any man that wants his son circumcised must do the following.  1) get his own penis cut on (if he was previously circumcised, then remove just a little more tissue- but if he wasn't, then do a full circumcision anyway), with the same amount of anesthesia that we give to infants- that is, almost none. It has to be done with the adult fully awake and strapped to the operating table. And he cannot revoke consent- once he's strapped down, he's getting cut. The same can be done to a woman, with appropriate changes to what amount of the clitoris gets removed (the foreskin has about half the nerve endings of the penis, so about 2/3 of the clitoris sounds about right).\n\nStep 2). wait 6 months for it to heal. During that time, if the person experiences any pain, the doctor cannot treat it. However if the symptoms are plainly visible, such that a parent would notice them on a fussy baby during a diaper change, THEN the guy can go to the doctor. But he can't speak while at the doctor's. This can be enforced any number of ways.\n\nStep 3). you'd think here it would be okay for the person to say \"okay, I think that's okay to do to my son\". But you'd be wrong. The person who was just cut is only NOW informed about what the procedure may entail. So NOW he can give informed consent. But if we let him just have it done to the baby, he could be simply saying \"okay, I endured the pain, now he can, too.\" And that's not ethical. It's the OPPOSITE of ethical. To do that would be SUBJECTING the baby to something, rather than choosing it because the father has decided that the costs are not too high. The dad has to choose to have his own penis cut on AGAIN, the same as before, strapped down with no ability to stop the process, and without anesthetic, while fully awake, now that he knows what it entails and exactly how bad it will hurt.\n\nStep 4) wait another 6 months, with the same restrictions- he's not allowed to seek a doctor regarding his penis unless the problem is visible to an untrained eye, and then, he cannot speak during the doctor's appointment.\n\nAfter that, this person has demonstrated that he fully understands what it means to make the decision to alter someone else's genitals without consent. And he can then request a surgeon to do the circumcision.\n\nAlso, any doctor who will be cutting on an infant's penis without medical need would be required to go through this in exactly the same way we would require the father / mother.\n\nWhy does the surgeon have to have the \"medicine\" applied to him first in this case? Simple: it's not FUCKING MEDICINE. Almost nobody chooses to get circumcised, and when they do, it's because they're switching religions, or because they have a medical problem. Well, babies don't HAVE religion. And we're not talking about ones who have medical problems. So yeah, if a doctor is going to do a ritualistic mutilation, he needs to have gone through it twice to make sure he (or she, I guess) understands it.\n\nAnything else would be either completely unethical, or intentionally blinding oneself to the ethical problems of such an operation.",

That's how a normal human penis is until sometime between 6 years and late puberty.   Also, circumcision is not the proper treatment for phimosis.\n\nThis shit needs to be illegal.\n\nFor a more apt, and far more disturbing analogy, detaching the foreskin from the head of the glans is essentially equivalent to penetrating the hymen and vagina of a girl of the same age of whatever boy you're talking about doing it to... then couple that with the added pain of removing a fingernail from the nail bed.\n\nIt's sexual assault, coupled with torture, but the torture also happens as a prelude.\n\nA reasonable requirement (far more reasonable than what I have above) would be to require the parent to be in the room for somebody else's infant being circumcised, so they can make an informed choice about their son.\n\nAfter all, if it's just a little snip, what would the problem be?",

Or if the Jewish aspect is more about they inflicted trauma of the circumcision itself. I really think some follow-up questions are in order! What specifically, aside from belief in things we have to actual reasons to believe are real, makes harming children in this way, Jewish?\n\nAnd what the hell- convention on rights of the child, the child having the right to be brought up in the parents’ religion?

Plenty of people seem to legitimately believe that circumcision is not harmful and that it's not violating bodily integrity, many even comparing it to vaccinations.

No anesthesia, being held down and restrained, fully awake.

It's rare for a family to openly discuss it like the OP does in this post, and I suspect that was brought on by the fact that it was done poorly, impairing OP's sexual or urinary functioning more than his functioning was intended to be interfered with.\n\nMost parents never mention it to their kids (in the USA). It's just one of those things that happen, that parents do without thought, especially when the doctors recommend it, even though the doctors are not recommending it for medical reasons.",

No thanks.\n\nOne nurse even tried to convince me to do it, since she had for her son, by saying since he was one day going to be an elderly man in a nursing home, they wanted it to be easier to keep him clean.  She was making this baby penis slicing decision for a future old man who would've been using it for a lifetime already at that point??  So disturbing...\n\nEvery single time they did rounds they assured me I still had 30 days to make my decision while in the NICU. I already made my decision!!  Leave him alone!!!

And several other countries that have had American influence recently have gotten onboard to various degrees. It's prevalent in South Korea I think, for example.\n\nThis happens at various ages in places that aren't America, where it all pretty much happens to infants. And Africa does its own thing- some of the tribes get weird with it. And some of the tribes actually wait for the boys to be of age of consent before they are socially pressured into it, which is honestly both more of a courtesy and a curse than what happens in other places.\n\nBut in general, 25% to 30% of the planet's males have had their genitals mutilated by their parents, or at their parents' request, almost always without assent (the legal word for \"consent from a child who can't legally consent\") of the child.",

There was a federal law in 1996 that outlawed cutting on girls' vulvas. But it was only used in court just recently, and if I recall, the judge threw it out because the law as written explicitly violated the equal protection clause of the constitution. So I'm not sure where this stands I guess.\n\nBut yeah, I suppose that many states wouldn't have laws SPECIFICALLY prohibiting cutting girls genitals, but there's not laws specifically prohibiting cutting off their toes or fingers or ears, either. It's just that people generally recognize those acts as harmful and thus outlawed by other, more general laws. And that's how I feel about male circumcision, too. We have laws that protect every part of a person's body, why in the world would there be a little exclusion area around the penis?\n\nBut yes, I think that parents SHOULD have equal right, regardless of gender, to mess their kid's sexuality... and that right should be zero right.",

Boys of that age still need to be monitored to ensure they are bathing properly. Yes they should have already been taught how, but they forget parts. A verbal reminder on the other side of the door/curtain is usually enough in my house, but some parents forget that they need to actually teach their kids how to bathe (instead of just showing them and figuring they'll get it), and so sometimes when independent bathing starts, or puberty and they start to really have a distinct smell, parents realize that they failed to TEACH proper hygiene.\n\nIt's uncomfortable to have to teach a teen how to properly bathe themselves, but sometimes necessary.",

If a child isn't circumcized the they'll need to be taught how to clean underneath it and gently retract it, and be monitored for any issues like phimosis. For these reasons some think the circumsized equals 'cleaner' but of course this isn't true. In America, circumcized is still the more popular choice, so often the tradition continues just because that's how the father is and that is the type of genitalia the parents have been exposed to. So often it is a cosmetic choice rather than a functional one. Of course people choose this for religious reasons as well but the majority of circumcisions are not religious decisions.",
