    "post_text ": "I’m sorry this is long.\n\nI’ve never understood what people were praising my mom for. She didn’t do anything to raise me, I raised myself. She didn’t foster my growth, she berated me on a daily basis. Despite this, she is constantly showered in praise for raising me by herself and doing what, really?? Not killing me?? Well done mom. I didn’t die. Good for you. \n\nWe never did anything as a family. She never cooked. She made me fat by forcing me to eat McDonald’s every single day and then screamed at me for being a “fat, lazy bitch”. She was obese at this point. I literally begged her to cook normal homemade meals and she didn’t give a fuck.\n\nShe was unbelievably picky about the meals she forced me to make but never picky enough to cook for herself. She was even a bitch about her McDonald’s order and would make me go back into the store a minimum of three times so that I’d meet her criteria. She was so lazy that she wouldn’t even get out of the car to eat inside. She’d make me go in and bring it to her EVEN THOUGH SHE KNEW that’d she’d send me back in to complain. She didn’t even do the complaining herself. She refused even to use a drive through. Despite this, I’m somehow the one who was the “lazy bitch”.\n\nShe was consistent with punishments but terrible at positive feedback. I had, and continue to have, zero support. \n\nShe hasn’t paid a dime towards my education but continues to take credit for my success.\n\nHonestly I’m the one who should be praised. Not only did I grow up with no positive adult role models, I took care of my mother daily. She acted as though she were bedridden. She would scream my name from across the house endlessly just so I could get her a glass of water from the kitchen less then 30steps away. \n\nShe always blamed me for being an economic strain when *I* was the one trying to budget for her as a *child*. I’d explain to her what purchases were unnecessary and would drive us further into the hole. She didn’t listen. She’d buy whatever she wanted. I never even ask for toys because of how poor we were but she’d buy timeshares and get her hair/nails done.\n\nGuess what though? I’m still ungrateful and I’m still the reason we’re poor. It was also my fault that my mom couldn’t remarry/keep a boyfriend.\n\nMy mom pushed everyone away from us. I had no one. She wouldn’t let me have friends or be close to family because she was jealous. She wanted me to be as miserable as her and if I was spending time with friends/family, I wasn’t spending time with her.\n\nDo you know how many times I asked to go somewhere and she’d say “what about *me*, what am *I* going to do when your gone?” \n\nShe’d even try and tag along if I ever did manage to go out with a friend. When my friend and I would ditch her she’d guilt me.\n\nThere isn’t even enough space for me to say everything I need to in this post. I just need people to stop attacking me for not appreciating the sacrifice my mom made to raise me without a husband. \n\nI was the sacrifice. \n\nPlease stop telling me bs like “I hope you get your mom something every Mother’s Day *and* Father’s Day” Or “wow you’re doing so well, your mom raised you right”.\n\n*I’m* the one who raised a child, not my mom. *I* took care of *her*.\n\nMy mom was a single mom and that’s why I had no other parent to give me the love and affection that she didn’t. She didn’t even do the bare minimum of parenting and I’m sick and tired of hearing her get praised for the sorry childhood she gave me.\n\nPlease, only praise single moms when you *know* that they’re actually good parents.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that my mom didn’t even work. She was on disability the whole time and still is. Her disability isn’t so severe that it would have prevented her from raising me properly but she still used it as an excuse to do *even less* than the minimum requirements for parenting.\n\nEdit 2: a few people seem to think I’m attacking single moms at large. I don’t understand how they came to that conclusion. My point was to praise the actual parenting skills of a single parent rather than throwing blind compliments at them when it might not be deserved. I thought that was clear. Obviously, many single parents are great. Yes, single moms have it hard. I’m not disputing that. Nevertheless, single parents don’t deserve praise when they’re doing a shit job of parenting. I came to this sub to get support and I’ve gotten to talk to many wonderful people as a result (thanks for the awards!). That said, there are people messaging me/commenting about how I’ve rudely grouped single moms in with my terrible mom and single moms face even more discrimination than usual because of opinions like mine. This is exactly the kind of narrative I’m sick of hearing. Society should be able to understand that my case doesn’t represent the norm. I shouldn’t have to keep my story to myself because single moms might be affected.",
