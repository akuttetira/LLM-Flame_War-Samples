    "Post_Title": "I'm Convinced My 9th Grade Science Teacher Knew I was Being Abused",
    "post_text ": "I never spoke up about my abuse to any of my friends at school. Being a boy I felt I'd get made fun of if I told anyone how my mother makes me cry every day/night. All the teachers I had in jr high had told me I needed to stop acting out and listen more. I was the \"class clown\" type.\n\nWhen I got to high school my first science teacher was named, Mr. Barkas. I thought he was weird. It seemed that he was so quick to give me detention just for the slightest little slip up. In other classes I'd crack jokes with friends only to have teachers yell, \"No talking!\" but Mr. Barkas was different. The second I made a peep he'd always come over to my desk, look me in the eye with an incredibly soft smile and calmly say, \"You have detention after school.\" I thought it was because he enjoyed giving me detention so I didn't really like him at first but for some reason I still respected him. It was weird.\n\nI had detention all the time in his class. More times than not, I was the only kid in there. I remember thinking it was all bullshit because other kids acted up too. It's just that his detention wasn't like other detention. He'd always make sure I sat at the front of the class and he'd sit with me. He'd always say something like, \"Lets work on your science together.\" Detention would end and sometimes I'd stay to do more work with him. I can't recall correctly but I was failing his class with something like a 30. In just a few months of his \"detention\" I upped my grade to the 60's. He congratulated me and I just remember thinking, \"It's a 60, it sucks\" but he just wanted me to feel proud for being able to even do the work.\n\nI'm 31 now and ironically enough we live in the same neighbourhood. I moved away from my city then moved back years ago so this is completely by chance. I see Mr. Barkas at the grocery store every now and then and sometimes strike up a conversation. I have a thick beard now which I didn't have in high school so when I first ran into him I introduced myself so he could try and remember me. Before I could finish my sentence he called out my name. He remembered exactly who I was.\n\nEDIT: More memories are coming back as I go over this. Things I thought nothing of. Whenever he'd see me in the hall he'd always stop to have a conversation with me. It could be about anything. There were even times he'd see me walking around when I was supposed to be in class and it didn't matter. Just a quick 2 minute chat.",
