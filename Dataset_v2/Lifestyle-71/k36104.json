    "post_text ": "If they are not abusive to their friends, colleagues, Neighbours and acquaintances then they know what they are doing is WRONG.\n\nmy Nmum is a Fake, superficial people pleaser. who is SO caring and careful not to offend or inconvenience anyone \n\nEver seen them in a rage then answer the phone/door and be fake nice and then hang up and go back to screaming? Yeah that’s not someone who doesn’t know they are abusive.\n\nDon’t fall for the gaslighting!\n\n“They can’t help it”\n\n“They’re just stressed”\n\n“Well Nobody else has ever Had a problem with me”\n\nSame thing seems to happen With them being able to offer other people validation, fake empathy, being on time etc They are capable of it Just can’t be bothered to do it for us. \n\nEdit: Thank you so much for the awards!! Greatly appreciate it! I’m glad yall can relate! Sorry if I’m not able to respond to everyone.",

            "Reply_Text": "As a narcissist who had a Nmom. This is very true.\n\nI hated this growing up, because others would not possibly believe she was just kicking me in the stomach and screaming the worst belittling profanity at me (except for the neighbours)  2 seconds before they turned up and she managed to switch to telling them about how she is so broken and can't hack it anymore and that 14 year old me was the one who was being so aggressive and mind-fucking yet I would only ever raise my voice to hide back tears and not let her win and I never even defended myself from the beatings, buckets of water poured on me in my sleep, the subtle public humiliation etc.\n\nBut here I am. A grandiose with a number of other mental health issues, and despite not ever harming one of my exes, the abuse still fucks with my head.\n\nThe superficial thing however, narcissists I can tell you are unaware we switch to this. We don't always know if we're being abusive and for me, the only way I have made sure I'm not is to avoid any potential reaction or interaction that could be, which causes me to seem ignorant as I have to prevent myself from responding in arguments unless its calmly with my partners.\n\nWe don't see how we switch, we just do, because we are so trained to think everyone is judging us, and that everyone is on the attack against us so we have to keep them happy to prevent that. I have experienced this switch many times, my ex would get annoyed because we could be having a subtle argument in public and when she's annoyed I would run into a mate with full positive energy and she would get upset by this.\n\nFor my first relationship, I was confused when I would get her response that  it was abnormal because its what I had seen growing up and my Nmom had isolated me from any adults growing up and made all of our family and friends hate me,  so I couldn't learn anything else. This wasn't justified either, my mum would have a family member over 1x a year if that, but she would go to them without me 2/3 times a week, despite the fact she moved me a 2 hour drive away from them and randomly tell me about how they can't stand me, and are absolutely disgusted by me and she only goes there alone \"because you raised your voice\" or \"because you got a detention\" and they \"think you're a vile little shit\" etc.\n\nAnyway,  I hope this helps you guys get a better understanding. I may be a narcissist, but I am in my 20s and the abuse still fucks my life up, so I don't doubt it does yours too. If you guys have any questions, or would like some advice, my DMs are open, I dealt with the extreme end of a very clever Covert Narcissist, and I have learnt alot from it. Also, what helped me lose fear for my mother over time, was understanding that we live our lives through a negative perspective and that most negative perspective is of ourselves, so if you guys manage to survive Narcissism, you're winning and what you're forced to grow up believing and perceiving of yourself is the worst possible presentation of that and it can only get better afterwards.",

They're emotional toddlers. They can see when others abuse them and they can sure as shit be the victim even if they haven't been wronged, but they can't see how they affect others. When they're called out, they deny, shift the blame, point fingers, project, or make excuses for their behavior.\n\nYou don't sound like that. You just sound like you have fleas.",

This is a misconcepion as narcissists are made out by media to be evil and doomed to follow this pattern. Its not entirely true and there are varying types of narcissism. Many people who have experienced narcissistic parents are also likely to be narcissistic to some degree themselves even if its not full blown NPD.\n\nI siggest you do some real research into narcisssism rather than reading articles online because those aren't based on genuine psychiatry. They are based on selling views to people who are angry at narcissists.",
