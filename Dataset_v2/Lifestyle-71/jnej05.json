    "post_text ": "EDIT: I have been asked to share this picture of my honeybun: https://www.reddit.com/r/Chonkers/comments/gok8l6/my_new_best_friend_professor_chesterfield_chair/ \n\n\n\nI adopted my dead Nsister's cat. For weeks he had been locked in a tiny bathroom with no real social contact. He ate his feelings and got fat. He was yelled at constantly and blamed for anything and everything: something broke, something fell, he puked, he made his litter box dirty because he used it, he meowed too loudly, etc. Kitty could do no right. Now that he lives with me he has been doing better and becoming more social. So, it was breakfast time and I was filling up his bowl with the delicious kibble and he was very excited. He couldn't wait, and jumped up onto the (broken) table that is really unsteady. Well, he is a big guy, and the table fell over. It's a tiny table. It had some change on it, and some papers. No big deal. But he ran, terrified, and stared at me from the corner of the kitchen. He was waiting for me to scream at him and hit him the way *she* would have. I myself had frozen because growing up I would be yelled at and hit for small accidents all the time. I was frozen too. He looked at me, I looked at him, and then I relaxed and asked him if we was okay? He immediately ran up to me and was loving. He watched me pick up the papers. I told him the table is broken and it is not his fault. I know he didn't understand that, but he understood that I wasn't mad at him for an accident. I realized that both of us have been treated similarly by people bigger and stronger than us who are supposed to be protecting us. Well, no more yelling. Accidents happen. We all deserve to be treated better. And yes he got breakfast right after.",

They were just pointing out that unless OP says they dont have any regrets or grief over their sister, it's best to be sympathetic. Emotions are complicated things. Both my parents were/are narcs, and have put me through hell in different ways. But when my mom passed, I still grieved. On one hand, I'm free from her brand of torment, just my father left. On the other, well, she wasnt awful 100% of the time, and I miss the good parts, and the parts that should have been good and now can never be. I'm sorry for what you've been through, but please remember that not everyone's experiences and feelings will be the same, and we should do our best to help posters feel loved and welcomed no matter how they deal with losses. ♡",

Honestly this whole conversation is triggering, because it feels like you're defending someone who was being disrespectful. I hear what you're saying, but being triggered by something isn't an excuse to behave badly. Nor is it other people's responsibility to manage your emotions. And I've walked on eggshells for far too long to have to do it here where the environment is supposed to be supportive. I get the whole trying to be sensitive with what one says, but there is a point where people just need to take responsibility for how they respond.\n\nThere was no malice in my comment and due to the context in which it was said, the only way to get triggered by it is to completely ignore what was meant. And even then, how they responded to me is not justified.\n\nAlso, I was speaking from my perspective, so don't assume I was speaking for everyone. Nowhere did I imply everyone should feel the same way as me. Simply that I can understand how someone can mourn the loss of a family member who was abusive.\n\nAlso don't assume that everyone has the same definition of family that you do. The conditions on what you choose family to mean is subjective. For me personally, family doesn't need to imply fondness or closeness. I'm not the only one who thinks this way either. The level of love and support (to me) is a separate thing. I'm also not about to apologize for being able to forgive just because some may not be able to. I don't judge people for not forgiving, I get it. I was once there myself. But I'm not about to let people make me feel like it's wrong to forgive and expressing it.",

It’s okay to forgive someone for abuse if you want, and the forgiveness is usually for yourself to heal, not to let the abuser back in to abuse you more.\n\nI guess forgiveness in this sense is making peace with the situation and accepting it for what it is.",

You seem to feel strongly about people saying “family is family” and I don’t blame you. I have never been super close with my family aside from my dad cuz he’s the absolute best. I hate when people try to get me to work things out with them because they’re “forever”. I agree that’s coming from a closed-minded viewpoint but our perspective of seeing family as dispensable if they don’t respect our well-being could be seen as closed-minded to *them*.\n\nNeither is necessarily wrong it’s just different - so just like you don’t appreciate being told it’s still family, you’re getting downvoted because you’re pushing your viewpoint onto them when they didn’t ask for your opinion.\n\nI’m sure you’ve been told that phrase a million times so it’s probably extra hurtful to hear it again when none of us know you or what you’ve gone through. I just wanna say that your feelings are valid, even though sharing your opinion was misplaced on this post. 🖤",

I wasn't responding to your personal experiences, as if abuse was ok if it comes from a family member or that your feelings on your experience don't matter. I was responding from the view point that everyone processes things differently and feel differently about their situation. So it's understandable (for me at least) to see someone mourn the loss of a family member, even if that person was abusive, or even be able to love someone even if you can no longer trust them or have them be a part of your life. My Nmom is the only mom I've got, so to me she is still my mom even if it's only biologically.\n\nYou can think different and that's your choice. But don't hate on me for thinking she is still family.\n\nIf someone says sorry for your loss, I assume it comes from a place of sympathy because despite the circumstances, op lost someone, and for all you know they could be mourning that person.\n\nPsychology is complicated. We can't just expect people to feel the same way we do and assume they're wrong if they don't.",
