    "Post_Title": "\"But what did she go through in childhood ...\" - No, I am not to blame for my mother's childhood and I am not my grandfather! I didn't even exist at the time! Therapists and facilitators, stop using this as an excuse.",
    "post_text ": "It's the same thing every time, people just decide that they can't believe the huge amount of things my brother and I went through because of my NMom, therapists or facilitators they all use the same text that she always used to \"solve\" any thing she did with us, usually starts with \"But what did she go through in childhood ...\" and extends endlessly to the successful career that she supposedly lost because I was born, a lot of crying and screaming, in the end nothing, I said NOTHING of the real issue that we were discussing is resolved and under no circumstances will she apologize.\n\nHer childhood is the perfect shield and no one seems to realize that I did have nothing to do with her childhood and that she destroyed our childhood based on the excuse that she had a worse. I am not my grandfather, I am not a crazy alcoholic who destroyed the house when he arrived drunk and had a narcissistic way when sober, I am not him and neither is my brother, but while she pays tribute to him on social media and spreads it to 4 corners of the world that he was a great father, do we both have to endure the guilt of what happened? Am I punished and can't I complain because of what that bastard did?\n\nI'm tired of people just forgetting everything and telling me that I must forget, because of a story in which I don't even exist!\n\nEven though she told me she should have taken medicine to abort me, raised false testimony for my father against me, threatened to crash the car with me and my brother inside if my father did not file for divorce, killed 3 frogs because she I thought it was spells, she destroyed my self-esteem by telling me that people like me ended up depressed or alcoholic, forced me to go to all sorts of groups and courses full of people who made my stay a real hell, hiding information to avoid me being diagnosed with autism, she asked the psychologist to do a secret homosexuality test on me when I was 11, among many other things.\n\nEverything I said above, without any exception the excuse was \"Her childhood was difficult\". I don't have the patience to listen to this again, to everyone who told me this and simply ignored everything we went through, I say \"Congratulations to you, for creating a childhood equal to or worse than hers, you are ALL guilty of this\"\n\nTL;DR: Therapists and facilitators, continue to excuse NMom's toxic behavior by saying that she had a difficult childhood, I'm sick of it! I didn't even exist in her childhood!\n\nEdit: Guys, these affirmations of difficult childhood were not used by therapists to understand the abusive cycle, they were used to keep me on the cycle, here are some other absurd phrases I heard: \"Mothers always want the best, they carried their children in the womb for 9 months\" , \"It looks like you're not listening to your mom \"or\" You're losing your love for your mom \"\n\n(I apologize for any spelling mistakes, I am very stressed at the moment and needed to vent a little, thanks for reading.)",

I highly suggest start calling her a little bitch at life for giving into such ways of shitty human living standards just cause she a was a little pussy to run away from people she knew were terrible to her.\nBasically you have to become not her son but her friend now.  Thats i did it with my folks and now we're the best of friends.\nRun your tongue off and if she attacks be prepared to defend yourself.  Just dont hurt her.\nI personally pushed both my father to the floor laughed at his face and told him he was a bitch and then left to a friends house.\nYou need to gain respect and the only way to ruin a bully is to bully back",
