    "Post_Title": "Victim-blaming is happening way too much in this SUPPORT GROUP. What is victim-blaming and why it's not okay? Read-up, even if you think you know this topic already.",
    "post_text ": "First, please always keep in mind that this is a SUPPORT GROUP for TRAUMA SURVIVORS.  Do not comment to OPs who are here looking for support in a harsh way or with pat non-advice like \"just move out.\"  It isn't helpful and I'm going to breakdown why, so bear with me.  After I explain what not to do, I'm going to explain what to do instead, so please read the whole thing.  \n\n**What not to do:**\n\nWe are currently seeing a lot of posters who are in horrible situations living with their parents and the comments are full of \"just leave\" or \"move out\"  or \"put your mom's ass in jail.\"  This advice assumes a lot.  It assumes that the OP is in a mental and emotional place to do these things.  This assume the parent would not try to kill the OP after they get out of jail or if the parent doesn't go to jail at all, because the law doesn't see it the way the comment section does. It assumes that the OP has the resources or skills to be independent.  Not everyone can survive homelessness.  Not everyone wants to try.  This is valid.  Keep reading...\n\nSome people have been sabotaged by their parents in developing the skills needed to be independent.  Often this takes the form of parents making sure the person never gets a driver's license... never gets an ID.... never does well in high school... never goes to college.... etc. etc. etc.  Some parents will steal their children's money or identifying information (birth certs, social security card, etc.) so that they never have the resources to leave and it's not always so easy to stop those dynamics.  Some parents will try to kill their adult children for leaving.  \n\nSome people are disabled or have serious health conditions and rely on their parents for caregiving or health insurance so that they can get needed medical care so they can survive and stuff.  Some people need their parents for affordable childcare, because affordable childcare isn't a thing in this country, even if the poster has a job and can drive.  Some people are staying with their parents to protect their younger siblings or other family members who might not survive the abuse, if left there alone.  Some of our posters are gathering the skills or resources to leave ASAP, but they just don't have it all ready, yet.  \n\nFurther, it is a REALLY, REALLY WELL KNOWN PHENOMENON that even people who have all the resources to go often can't go immediately, because it takes time to understand what abuse is, to believe that you are being abused, to believe your own experiences, and then to take the steps to actually go.  This can be even harder for people who are from more communal cultures and for people who know they will lose all their family connections and maybe even all their friends, if they cut ties.  \n\nJudging people for struggling with any of these dynamics doesn't help people leave and makes them feel like even this group isn't a safe space for them to ask for support.  It frequently just makes people feel even more hopeless and less capable of leaving or even surviving the abuse.  The mods of this group truly do want everyone who needs to get away from their abuers to get away ASAP when it's possible and that is why we have the policy about victim blaming that we have.  \n\nWhen you blame a poster for not having left already, you are victim blaming.  When you tell a poster that \"you can't control others, so just leave,\" you are victim blaming.  When you judge posters for enduring what they are enduring, you are victim blaming.  When you ask a poster why they put up with this BS, you are victim blaming, because the poster may not have any other better choices or the OP may be dealing with a very well known psychological phenomenon where abused people find it hard to leave even if they do have the resources and nothing else holding them back.\n\n**What to do instead:**\n\nHow do you not victim blame?  Well, you keep the focus on the abuser.  You validate the OP that what is going on is not okay.  You validate the hell out of the OP...  tell the OP that they didn't deserve the abuser... tell the OP that what happened was not okay... tell the OP that their story makes sense and you believe them.  These are the sorts of things that make people feel heard and stronger.  You, perhaps, gently remind the OP to take self-care or distance, if they safely can.  You can gently tell the OP that you hope they are able to leave the abuser someday, if possible, but that you understand that this isn't always possible, so no judgment EVER.  Make sure you aren't assuming that the OP has all the skills, resources, and circumstances that you have, because, in a lot of cases, the OP is reacting differently to a situation than you did, because the OP's situation and circumstances are VERY different.  \n\nYou can gently suggest that the OP try to get out, but TREAD CAREFULLY.  Most posters have already thought of this.  Posters who know they can't leave right now may feel that your comment is just another hurtful thing someone has said to them.  Posters who are truly trapped by a lack of resources, skills, circumstances, or even well known psychological phenomenon that make it hard to leave may feel even more hopeless and less able to leave.  So, keep it gentle... keep in mind that not everyone can leave.  Make sure your words reflect that you understand this.  \n\nIn posts where you want to jump to tell the OP to \"just leave,\" PAUSE.  Take some breaths.  Check your assumptions.  Check the comments to see if 5,000 people didn't already tell the OP to \"just leave.\"  Check the comments to see if the mods haven't already told people to cut it out.  Check the comments to see if the OP has already explained WHY they can't \"just leave.\"  And, even if the OP feels like they simply aren't emotionally ready to leave, THEN DON'T JUDGE.  It sometimes takes time for people to gather up the fortitude to go.  Validate the OP that they do not deserve abuse.  Encourage them to practice self-care and maybe a good therapist, assuming the OP can access therapy (because many people cannot access it... it's expensive as hell).  Encourage them to keep posting and asking for support.  Encourage them to believe their own eyes, when they see they are being abused.  You can even gently encourage them to gather the resources, fortitude, skills or whatever to leave, but never assume that this will be possible for all people.  Don't assume that people who haven't left yet are just being weak or lazy.  Assume the OP is doing the best they possibly can, right now.  \n\nBut, if the OP says they just can't leave right now... don't push it.  In most cases, judging the OP for this is only going to make the poster less likely to ever leave.  And, always, always, remember that this is a support group.  \n\n**REPORT VICTIM BLAMING COMMENTS**  -  Please, for the love of pizza, folks, report rule-breaking and victim-blaming comments.  You can ANONYMOUSLY report any post or comment using the report button under every post or comment.  This puts the report in a queue of items the mods will review once one of us comes back online.  As this group really only has 4 active mods (most days), we rely on reports.  If you aren't reporting rule-breaking content, it will probably never be addressed because we don't have enough mods to read every post or comment, so report that stuff.  Thank you.  <3",

                            "Reply_Text": "You need to understand that the inner critic is in no way a healthy form of self-criticism that allows growth and maturity. It actually does the complete opposite. Especially since the inner critic is an amalgam of vitriol, self-hatred, toxic perfectionism that develops out of a need to survive the horrendous emotional, physical, and psychological abuse that Nparents put their children through. If anything, one of the main keys to overcome the abuse and grow as a person is to diminish this inner critic as much as possible. A task that can take a lifetime to accomplish. Do not confuse the inner critic with healthy self-introspection. Simply put, a person with a healthy childhood is not going to have the harsh inner critic that creates anxiety, panic, and terror at every corner. They’ll actually be able to develop healthy self-criticism that is supported by self-compassion and self-esteem: two key components that are severely lacking in people who grew up with Nparents. To understand this disgusting inner critic within the context of narcissistic abuse, I really recommend reading the book “Complex PTSD” by Pete Walker.",

They were pretty good in explaining what toxic parenthood is but didn’t have too much in way of advice on how to handle the rollercoaster of emotions and all the delayed developments in life that abuse brings. This book was recommended on various threads here in this subreddit and I decided to give it a shot.  Of all the books I read it has been the most helpful. In particular with dealing with upsetting emotional flashbacks. It does hit very heavy and triggered a lot of extremely painful memories, but it also helped me to release a lot of the weight I was carrying. I recommend you take your time reading it and have a highlighter handy because it has tons of information to process. I’m very glad you are getting it and I hope it helps your journey of healing.",

I'm really looking forward to it even though I know it will be difficult and likely painful, but like reading posts and stuff here it usually ends with feeling better. I actually saw someone else mention the same author shortly afterwards and thought it might have been you for a second, but I'm pretty sure that was someone else so it does seem very promising, alongside good reviews. I will keep in mind the advice of going slowly and taking notes. Thank you again, and I'm glad to hear it has been so helpful for you too",

None of the comments were insults toward you and downvotes are just a part of reddit, don’t take them personally.

It sounds like you are having a hard time seeing the difference so I really recommend you read the book. Even if you know what CPTSD is, the book really breaks down how to distinguish that evil inner critic from our actually healthy voices and introspection. It has been a huge help knowing that difference and having the power to shut down that inner critic voice. You can even just visit Pete Walker’s website and he has multiple articles on the subject.",
