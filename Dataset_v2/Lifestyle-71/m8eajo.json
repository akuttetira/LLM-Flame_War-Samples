    "post_text ": "I’ve been struggling lately with self blame and self loathing. Well, I ALWAYS struggle with it thanks to my nMum’s abuse but lately it’s been worse than normal due to other triggering factors.\n\nToday I had an appointment with my therapist and we were talking about this. During the session, I told her I don’t remember a lot of my abuse so I feel like a fraud. That maybe I’m misremembering or ‘making it up’. That’s when she said that it only takes one or two moments of being treated badly, even if we don’t remember it, for it to leave lifelong trauma.\n\nThis was a real eye opener to me because it only proves that even one time abuse can leave trauma. It’s petty logical I suppose, but I’d never thought about it like that before.\n\nJust wanted to share. I hope someone else finds it helpful.\n\nEdit: typos.\n\nEdit 2: Wow, thank you everyone for your comments and awards. It’s bittersweet to see how much this has helped. I’m so, so happy knowing it’s helped, but also sad that so many people suffer. I’m going to do my best to reply to all comments soon!",

There is more than enough research to indicate that a single event can indeed be traumatic, and repeated trauma is not the only form of trauma.\n\nThis invalidating and diminishing language is also completely unacceptable in a support group for abuse victims, as is the gatekeeping. We also do NOT tolerate transphobia here. You've been given a permanent ban.",

This is proven by science. If you have genital preferences, literally no one cares, that’s perfectly fine. You’re not obligated to date a single person on this planet, but if you date them because you believe them to be their AGAB you’re transphobic. Fuck off this subreddit, we don’t welcome assholes of your kind here.",
