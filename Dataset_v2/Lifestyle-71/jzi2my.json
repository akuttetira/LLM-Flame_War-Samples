Im, for the first time in years, trusting someone with my experiences, trying to seek help for once and you are going to make it about how helpful it makes me to YOU???\n\nIt wasn't trauma that made me kind, I choose to be\nI don't wanna see people go trough the same shits happened to me, I don't want to see my sibling hurt, but that's basic fucking human decency\nI'm so tired of people romanticising suffering and pain\nI'm tired of people wanting to \"fix me\" or shifting things aground to make it about them, what do they had from what's happened\nI'm so tired",

If we can't do this here, then where can we?\n\nAlso, it's really invalidating to negate the OP's explanation of how and why that statement does not reflect their reality. Turning it around and even labelling the OP a narc for expressing themselves here is inappropriate.",
