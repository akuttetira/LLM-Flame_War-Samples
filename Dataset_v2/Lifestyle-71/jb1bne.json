    "Post_Title": "If I use \"father\" when I'm telling you about my abusive parent don't say \"your dad\" when you talk about him in return. There's a difference and that difference matters. A lot.",
    "post_text ": "Edit: Muting the post. Thank you all for the support. Genuinely didn't think this would be a common thing but here we are. Muting mostly because people are are calling me an asshole, something I'm used to because people tend to side with my abuser because he's disabled now and also because I generally take shit without complaining which leads to 'suddenly having an attitude' when I complain. I reported the people who did this to live up to the 'asshole label'. Goodnight.\n\nThis comes from way back and it's just... can you not, please? I'm already struggling having to call him \"father\" instead of \"piece of shit\" or other variants I use when I'm talking to my brother. I'm struggling having to clean up after him and having to refer to him as \"my father\" and have people give me a sorry look when I tell them he had a stroke and can't be there. I have not looked at his face or eaten at the same table as him in over a month even though we live in the same house. Then I'm talking to friends and acquaintances who KNOW he's abusive and that the stroke didn't affect how abusive and narcissistic he is and I use \"father\" DELIBERATELY and then they'll use \"dad\" 5 seconds later. There's a real semantic difference between the two words and it matters. It triggers me greatly when people do this but I hate starting shit so I shut up and generally just stop talking altogether.\n\nMind also that I'm bilingual living in a Portuguese-speaking context. In portuguese there's no short version of the word for \"father\" (pai) because it's already short enough. There's the baby talk version (papá) but that's about it. People don't normally use it when they're older than maybe 10. When you're talking to a sibling or your mum you'd say \"o pai\" (the father) not \"o meu pai\" (my father) as you'd say to anyone else, but my brother and I don't do that. We refer to him as \"him\" and when my mum doesn't get it we gesture with our head and she knows. We really want to cut him off because there's no saving anything. We tried when he had the stroke but the stroke made him even more entitled since now he can't hit us.\n\nAnyway, this is a vent/rant so I'm rambling freely letting all this out. The point is that in English it's especially triggering because there is a way to showcase that you're not close to your parent and people deliberately ignore the words you're using. Or maybe it's just me because I'm a linguist.",

We're not talking about me going to them to talk, this is a private twitter where I have people I know irl in and some other people that I consider friends. Not best friends, but friends. So I'll be vagueing and shit and they'll come through trying to reach out like 'is it your dad again' and depending on how upset I am and who they are, I may not even reply. Sometimes I bother correcting them, again, depending on what happened or what I'm upset about, others I just say 'father, not dad' and they'll go like 'right' and for a bit it seems like they've got the message but then they don't. I don't want to have to explain why this triggers me in detail. They're not bad people, they just I don't know, they don't get it and as many people in this comment section have said, it is interchangeable for the average English speaker and I do know that. Non-bilingual speakers of English have a hard time getting it for the most part and honestly I'm just tired. If I'm not extremely angry or upset, I'll correct it, if I am I'll just say nothing. Sorry for the long reply. Some commenter upset me.",

I had to just suck it up) but I have a friend who's a bit of an airhead and always uses my assigned gender's pronouns which is frankly baffling because she has other gender non-conforming and trans friends so I really don't get it.

I believe that it s what a good friend should do. we arent talking about random people on the street or acquittance, we are talking about people that should be caring for him. so I respectfully disagree with you and believe that it s something that they should be doing because the author of this post is struggling while his friends arent struggling and if they care as friend supposed to, then they should be doing things to ease their friend's discomfort, to offer support, or at least not to add to it, instead of their struggling friends to make that his other friends feel at ease while he keep struggling alone.\n\nthe only acceptable situation here is if their friends can't do it because for whatever reason,  if they are not able to do it, or if they need time to do it , but then they need to warn their friend that they are working on to making the habit and need time.",
