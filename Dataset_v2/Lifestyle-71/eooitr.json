Not gonna lie I dreamt of moving to an orphanage as a kid even though now I realize it’s a very selfish thought. I just don’t understand how she can take that and even then try to make me feel guilty with “it could be worse”. No mom, in my world it was as bad as it could get. I know it’s shitty for me to say but as a child all I thought was “cancer could mean death and I could be free” and “orphanage doesn’t have you”.  And honestly the thing that frustrates me the most is still being told “she’s your mom, the only mom you have, you can’t hate her!” Yes. Yes I can. I’m sorry for this rant, just got emotional and angry for a second lol",

Honestly and truly. It's nice to be able to say that without people screaming that I shouldn't.

And i mean: visit hours were the only thing I dreaded there :')\n\nMy beloved (s)mother still found ways to make it about herself cuz, I mean, I was such a terrible child for not wanting to chat with her and \"forcing her to sit on an uncomfortable chair all day when she's so busy and came over just for my sake!\", me and my failing lung... (and I was in such a good mood from the limited contact that I just told her \"go home, then\"... all hell cut loose, predictably, worth it tho 😂)\n\nAlso, ofc, talking from experience: if you have cancer they'll just tell you that *there's people with a worse cancer and you should feel lucky* instead",
