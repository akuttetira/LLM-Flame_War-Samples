    "Post_Title": "The fact that most atheists began as theists defeats the argument that atheists are just “closed minded” toward religion and the supernatural",
    "post_text ": "While not all theists express this, it’s not uncommon for atheists to be accused in one way or another of being close minded toward religion and the supernatural. This is often framed as there being ample evidence and logical proofs for why theism and/or the supernatural is true/exists, but atheists are close minded and choose to ignore this evidence. \n\nThis accusation can handily be dismissed by one fact: most atheists used to be theists. Exact data on this is rather hard to gather according to multiple sources like pew research, but one fact is patently obvious: globally, theism far outweighs atheism. It logically follows that in countries that are predominantly theist and/or have a history of being predominantly theist, then most atheists in these countries would have originally been theists. \n\nIt doesn’t make sense to say that people who used to believe in theism and the supernatural are closed minded against believing those things. \n\nI can speak to my own experiences here as a former Christian. I went to church every week multiple times a week for services, small group Bible studies, fellowship, prayer nights, etc. I volunteered in Sunday school even, helping 5th grade boys to learn about god and the Bible. I read my Bible daily, as it was a family activity to read and discuss a Bible verse or group of verses after dinner. I had absolutely zero doubts about christianity’s truth and the real existence of the supernatural for most of my life. I felt that I had a real relationship with god and could feel his presence in my life. \n\nI slowly became an atheist after several years of doubts slowly building, starting in high school and culminating in college. This included a long period where I evaluated the evidence as best I could and concluded that Christianity was true and there supernatural claims it made were true as well. It was only after many years and learning and evaluating that I became an atheist. I no longer believe any religion is true or that the supernatural is likely to exist. \n\nGiven this, it is both shocking and insulting how many times I have been accused of being close minded.  It’s just assumed that I ignore or refuse to expose myself to anything that would prove a religion or the supernatural are valid.  \n\nMy story isn’t unique. Most atheists were raised theist. Many atheists were fervent theists who sincerely believed for many years of their lives. Many of us did not want to become atheist, like myself.  To write us off as close minded is not only ignorant but downright offensive.",

Most schizophrenics had normal mental thought processes. Will all the religions out there and the different ways people grow up in religious structure it’s naive to simply use the “I was religious once so I know all there is to know about it”\n\nAkin to “I have a black friend I’m not racist”\n\n\nEdit: Oops went again the atheist hive mind.

They can understand the processes and understand why they do business the way they do and how operations work there. How about a defector from a country/regime, can they not understand how the laws and politics work? How about a brand loyalist that changes loyalties to another brand because they feel the product is better, they can’t remember what arguments there were for the former brand?\n\nNo? A disorder?
