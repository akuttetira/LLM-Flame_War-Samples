    "Post_Title": "To theists: If there exists proof that your religion is correct, why hasn't god made this proof more obvious (eg writing on the moon, or a new miracle/prophet every year). If there exists no hard proof, then it's justified to be a non believer or apostate.",
    "post_text ": "Non-theists please resist the overwhelming compulsion to submit a top level comment as I really only want to know how theists respond\n\nTo expand: If god has made proof of his religion available at one point or another in the form of the resurrection, or scientific predictions in scripture, physical miracles, or otherwise - clearly he's not hiding the truth and he has made it obvious for many people that this religion is the true one. Why hasn't he made it equally obvious to everyone else on earth, for the rest of time? Why has he only chosen to make it extremely obvious for some people rather than others? Either witnesses of the miracles, speakers of the languages of his original texts, or contemporaries at the time of revelation. Why not make regular miracles to convince everyone all the time, why has he instead decided to play coy?\n\nSecondly, if there is no hard proof then isn't being a non believer or apostate perfectly justified?",

IE if a subject matter is unfalsifiable it means science is not equipped to study the subject.\n\n2) you do understand there are other academic pursuits outside of science right?\n\nfor instance i could make a philosophical argument, or i could make a cosmological argument or a theological argument or even a mathematical (well i couldn't but i've seen it done. Heck i could even make a case based on the same proof standards required in a court of law.\n\nto say no valid argument can be made is to hide (you are hiding)/trying to avoid an discussion you are not equipped to have.\n\nTo which why are you on reddit if you do not want to/cant discuss these things?\n\n**Your prophet is a long-dead con man.**\n\nI not muslim... so i don't have a prophet.\n\n**I'm not going to sit here and pretend your beliefs are okay or acceptable.
