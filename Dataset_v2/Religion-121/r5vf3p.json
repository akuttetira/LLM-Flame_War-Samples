    "post_text ": "The eighth commandment of the ten commandments is “Thou shalt not steal\". This would imply that stealing is a sin. Therefore if Jesus stole a horse, then Jesus sinned and was not without sin when he died and could not be the Messiah as promised by the Jewish god in the old testament.",

If he knows the owner why not just tell his disciples to go find the owner and ask?\n\nKnowing someone doesn't limit your ability to steal from them. If I know my neighbor has a truck in his garage and the key is on the dash, I can't send my brother to go get it for a joy ride. Doesn't matter that I know the owner. I never asked. The police would still consider this theft.",
