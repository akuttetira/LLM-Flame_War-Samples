    "post_text ": "I’ve seen incidents through reading and on the news regarding Christians in the US essentially winning cases, or being exempt from laws purely down to their belief alone, despite there being no logical justification. The example that stood out to me the most was that a church in New Mexico was granted exemption by the Supreme Court for taking the hallucinogenic drug DMT; something that anyone outside of the exemption would otherwise be prosecuted for. Their only justification was that it enabled them to connect with their belief on a more spiritual level. There are many examples like this in the US and I wanted to know how it can be justified by a state that claims to be secular, yet grants exemptions to Christian communities; doesn’t it make the judicial system appear a little biased?",

            "Reply_Text": "Super complicated issue, but I essentially agree. There are exceptions for things like Peyote which has been shown to be part of specific rituals in specific situations by specific indigenous religion for hundred, perhaps even thousands of years. Then there are new religious movements and even scams that hide behind the clothing of religion to essentially do what they want.\n\nThere is plenty of legal precedent to forbid certain religious practices as unlawful. We do not allow for human sacrifice, for example. Until the legalization of Marijuana, Rastafarians could not use it as part of their practice (even though it is part of their culture).\n\nI think there are responsible ways to manage it. For example, if said Church of DMT could show that use of DMT was used in a controlled way, that the use of the drug was regulated and administered under medical supervision in a retreat or place where the affected individual cannot harm themselves or others, then there could be accommodations that could be made, much like there are exceptions for certain drugs to be used as part of medical research.\n\nBut I agree that to allow people to form a Church essentially for the purposes of thwarting a law is reprehensible.",

Beliefs are important to people, and the source of those beliefs whether magical or not is immaterial. One person's 'magic' is another person's 'science.'\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>If it can be made to be safe enough to have a religious exemption, why wouldn't the law be \"you can use DMT so long as you do it safely per these guidelines?\"\n\nSure, one of those guidelines being \"you must be a member of the said religion and use it in accordance with its safe administration per the religious tradition or regulations.\" If the practice is entirely unsafe, or endangers life, it doesn't matter whether it is religiously permissible, it is still illegal. For example, drinking cyanide-laced Kool-aid might be religiously indicated, but it results of the death of the participant in nearly all cases and so puts an undue burden on society. Ritual suicide is therefore illegal. DMT doesn't fall into that category. IF, and only if the religion can demonstrate that the practice involving DMT is *safe* and *voluntary*, then an exception *could* be made, just as an exception was made during Prohibition for sacramental wine.\n\n>Making religious exemptions just undermines the rule of law, since there are laws that apply to some people but not others. That's the crux of OP's argument.\n\nAnd it is a flawed argument. It doesn't, really. What the government is saying is the recreational and unregulated use of DMT is harmful to society. There may be exceptions to the use of DMT, just as morphine is dangerous if used recreationally and unregulated but is useful in certain controlled circumstances. A religious exemption might be permissible if the religion could show that a) it is necessary for the practice of the religion, that b) there aren't legal alternatives to fulfilling the religious nature of the drug, and c) it will not cause harm, and controls are in place to keep it from being abused.",

There could be an exemption for treatment of a condition like PTSD. There could be exemptions for specially licensed practitioners. I’m just saying that we should not *rule out* an exemption based solely on the fact that it is based on a religious reason. I have also stated that using a religious reason solely as an excuse for thwarting law is wrong as well. In other words, if you created your church just so you can drop acid, no. If your church has used peyote for hundreds of years, and you don’t want to be on the wrong side of the law, then let’s have a chat about it.\n\nReligion, while it may not be important to *you* is nevertheless important to a lot of people. Important enough that they refuse to convert in the face of persecution, will martyr themselves for their religious beliefs and migrate to practice their religion freely. As a Jew, such things have defined my culture for millennia.\n\nReligion in American culture is a protected right. And while there are religious practices that might not align with our individual tastes we still must attempt as a society to respect religion to the extent of not preventing people from practicing their religion providing it doesn’t harm others or society as a whole.\n\nAnd while art *could* be the basis for an exemption for drugs, as a culture we have decided that the human need to practice their religion is more important enough to warrant an exemption, but that since one can make art without using drugs, then the need for an exemption isn’t as urgent. And if it were the Baptist Church petitioning the government for an exemption to using peyote, my guess is they would have a hard time. But if it was allowing Anasazi shamans to use it to practice vision quests (as they have done from time immemorial?) A valid question.",

                            "Reply_Text": "Well, no. Societies make laws, rules and norms that protect the society from things that it deems as harmful to the society. Drug abuse, sex trafficking, and traffic laws are just a few examples of rules that we as societies impose to protect the society as a whole. As a society we have made certain judgements that some drugs have legitimate uses under certain conditions. For example, to a soldier suffering a traumatic injury, the administration of morphine can help alleviate pain to keep the soldier alive long enough to get them into more intensive medical care. The same drug, unregulated, causes addiction, contributes to crime and causes long term suffering for many.\n\nNow the Libertarian in us might think that such a decision is for each person to decide, but the reality is that we are not all equal in terms of expertise and as social creatures our actions have an effect on others and their ability to exercise agency. It also fallaciously assumes that people always act in rational ways that take into account what is good for them as individuals and what is good for the groups that they belong to. In a completely unregulated society that degenerates into \"might makes right\" very very quickly.\n\nSo the idea of things like drug laws is a balancing act--there must be enough liberty so as to allow the individual the agency to make their own decisions, but protection for others in society so that one person's agency does not become another person's slavery. In some religions, there are practices that are not in the mainstream. To the extent that those practices can be limited to the group, completely voluntary and are not harmful to the individual, accommodations could be made without endangering the rest of society. Certain practices might be off the table (i.e. compulsory female circumcision, human sacrifice, scarring and branding) because as a society we deem them to be harmful and the harm to the society is greater than the benefit that allowing them imposes.\n\nNow it is true that a secular organization could ask for an exemption, but there would have to be a basis for such an exemption. As a society we generally regard religion as good for society, so by claiming an exception on the grounds of religion is appropriate, provided it meets the criteria outlined above. If the secular organization deemed the exception beneficial to society in some way, exception should be granted for that. For example, there is mounting evidence that PTSD can be treated quite successfully with a high dose of Psilocybin administered under controlled conditions, so as a society we are currently negotiating the process of evaluating whether the good of the exception is good for society as a whole vs. the risk it poses to the greater society. The people who are arguing for that exception are secular groups.\n\nProvided there is a greater good for society at play (not just personal liberty) the conversation is appropriate.",

And if there is a practice that is actually part of a religious tradition, we have already committed as a society to not prohibit such practices to the extent that they don't harm others or infringe on their rights. Killing people who draw blasphemous pictures of god's prophet for example, might be codified as virtuous in a particular religion, but as a society we have decided that such action would favor one religion over another and threaten the rights of people who were not part of said religion. So we as a society do not permit that practice to be carried out, because to allow for the killing people who aren't part of your religion sets the stage for religious wars, which many of our Founders came to America to escape in the first place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Uhh, no. Many theists would say that it would be good for society if society all followed their religion, but that is exactly the bias they aren't allowed to impose.\n\nGo back and read again what I wrote. We (The United States of America) have decided *as a society* that religion and religious observance is generally good for society. Note that we do not specify *which* religion is good for society, but that religion as a general social institution is a good thing for a healthy society. If we did not regard that as true, then we would not have made the first amendment to our Bill of Rights the freedom to practice the religion of our choosing.\n\nNot all societies regard religion in this way. The People's Republic of China has decided that *any* religion is bad for society and so persecutes people who openly practice religion. North Korea views religion as enough of a threat that they ask people at the border if they are carrying a Bible as a standard question, and will imprison and punish anyone openly practicing religion, whether or not they are a citizen. So different societies have different views on the matter.\n\nWhether or not religion is *actually* good or not, or whether *you* believe it is good or not is immaterial: as a society, as a *group*, we have decided that religion and the ability to practice it freely is beneficial to society enough to assign the highest protection to it. If there is a practice that falls under the practice of religion, there should be a burden on the religion to demonstrate that the practice is 1) necessary for the practice of said religion, and 2) is truly a part of that religion and not simply made up for the sake of expediency, and 3) does not harm or infringe the rights of those inside or outside the religion who might differ from the religion. This is admittedly, tough to do.",

Indeed a plurality of religions increases the chance that religions will clash with each other, like often happens in India.\n\nWhat the first amendment DOES do is gets the government out of the religion business. And to prohibit a practice that is considered sacred to a particular religion is akin to making a law respecting (another) religion. A good example of this is Prohibition. While alcohol was indeed prohibited, exceptions had to be made for Christians who used it in the Eucharist, and Jews who used it as part of Sabbath and holiday celebrations. Those exceptions however, were allowed only under certain conditions necessary to meet the religious nature and obligation, nothing more. I don't see how DMT, mushrooms or Peyote is any different than sacramental wine.",
