    "post_text ": "You never hear of NASA scientists or Quantum physicists getting possessed by demons/jinns. When you look at online stories or YouTube videos, the overwhelming amount of cases of supposed demon/jinn possession seem to be from less educated, less rational people who tend to believe in demons/jinn. \n\nSo conventional wisdom would suggest if someone was actually afraid of being possessed by some demon/jinns, then by no longer believing in them you could theoretically gain immunity from these supposedly supernatural creatures. You will no longer need to get an exorcism/ruqyah after the fact. \n\nI'm not advocating that you need to leave religion in order to avoid possession. You can still believe in other concepts like heaven/hell or God if that floats your boat. All I'm arguing is that a practical solution to not getting possessed, is to not believe in the things that supposedly posses people. \n\nJust like the cliche lessons we were taught as kids \"what you don't fear has no power over you\". Or maybe that was from Monster's Inc. I forget.",

I did not completely discount them but I was confident that these people suffered from mental illness or were bored and just wanted to concoct stories and scenarios that people found interesting and fun. I was sure many were liars and exaggerated. I don't want to discuss my personal experiences but I will say this I do not discount these things and the only real proof that you could have is to be possessed or under the control of a telepath or spirits that being said I am sure that it is real.",

I would go into it more but you don't want to discuss your persona experiences, which is the only way to look into this farther. In the meantime let me say that the only real proof that you could have that Santa is real is to see him putting presents under your tree.",

I was born Roman Catholic but barely went to church and did not have a lifestyle that was congruent with all the bible's teachings I was very good natured though and had a pretty strong moral compass I only read the bible 2-3 years ago and I am 39 now. I don't believe people can be eternally damned as long as free will is still an aspect of man. Have a good day and thanks for listening.",
