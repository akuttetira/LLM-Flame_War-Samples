    "post_text ": "**Names of God**\n\nIn Islam there are the 99 Names of Allah. In Zoroastrianism which predates Islam there are the 101 names of God.\n\n**Prayer**\n\nZoroastrians pray 5 times a day. Islam later copied the **number** and the **prayer times**\n\n**Wudu/Abdest/Ablution**\n\nZoroastrians are required to wash their faces and limbs before prayer. Muslims borrowed it.\n\n**Heaven/Hell**\n\nJudaism didn’t have the concept of heaven and hell. Only after the persian King Cyrus freed the Jews from their Babylonian yolk, they began to absorb this idea. Christians borrowed it from the Jews and Islam borrowed it from the eralier ones.\n\n**Angels**\n\nAgain. Judaism didn´t know angels or similiar creatures. They also borrowed it from Zoroastrianism. Christians and Muslims later borrowed it also.\n\n**Journey to Heaven**\n\nthe story of Muhammads night journey is based on Arta Virafs night journey\n\n**Paradise**\n\nin Quran paradise is called al-firdaus. This word is from Persian Pirdaus. But arabs lack the sound “p”. Therefore they changed it to “f”.\n\n**Apocalypse Description**\n\nZoroastrianism depicts the end of the world in the same way Islam does. For example, a scale is present that weighs your sins as well as your good deeds. This scale is present in both Islam and Zoroastrianism. Another example can be found in the fact that people will have to walk a rope that leads to heaven, however, if you fall from the rope you will fall into the fires of hell. This Zoroastrian description is almost identical to the Islamic \"Sirat\" Rope bridge found in the Quran.",

The people in pre islamic Arabia didn't know Jesus before muhammad became a prophet including Muhammad himself because christianity didnt stretch that far, instead they had local religions that worshiped statues around the kabah. After he became a prophet and introduced islam, Muhammed didnt refer to him as Jesus like christians did, but rather Issah, so even if you asked arabians back then if they knew Jesus after islam I don't they'd say yes.\n\nAdressing your last question, islam believes there are many prophets that were sent that had they're message changed overtime, and that it isn't limited to just Jesus and Moses, or the other 23 prophets that were named. That's why many muslims, and they're children from all over the world memorize the quran word for word, so it doesn't get changed with time. Neither scholars or I, can say Zoroastrians came from islam because god didnt tell us, but its not confirmed that it came from its own thing either.",

I'm just saying it's a possibility because not all prophets were mentioned, so its possible that it was never copied. But the simple fact is I don't know, and no one on reddit knows.\n\nAnd about you saying the Quran did change, I remember a few years back I saw on the news that a university in the UK found a 1400 year old Quran, that was written on sheep skin. I did some research and it said they found that not a word has changed. Heres a link, but there are many others now that years have passed.\n\n[https://themuslimvibe.com/muslim-current-affairs-news/oldest-quran-discovery-proves-the-holy-quran-has-never-been-change](https://themuslimvibe.com/muslim-current-affairs-news/oldest-quran-discovery-proves-the-holy-quran-has-never-been-changed)\n\nAnd about you converting, Im sad you left, but if that's what you believe in then that's all that matters. Whoever tells you they know for sure what's out there is lying, we don't. The only thing we can do is make assumptions and follow what we believe in.",

Now Muslim doesn’t mean someone who follows Islam it means someone who has submitted to the one singular God.\n\nKhorasan itself was Zoroastrian/ Fire worshippers. But they converted to Islam and before you because they were forced. They weren’t conquered by the arabs. The people choose to join Islam on their own. Khorasan is the regions of Afghanistan, Iran and a bit of Pakistan. So if Islam copied Zoroastrianism why didn’t they call it out?",

It's a claim to bolster is authority while \"excusing\" any information he copies.  If this was true we would expect to see similar abramic teachings in other parts of the world that align with the bronze and iron ages.  But we dont.\n\n>So there is a chance that the founder of Zoroastrianism was a Muslim Prophet.\n\nNo, not any serious chance that someone without bias would consider.  Saying he might be a muslim prophet carries no more weight then saying he was a Taoist prophet.\n\n>Now Muslim doesn’t mean someone who follows Islam it means someone who has submitted to the one singular God.\n\nIf you want to use \"Muslim\" to mean any monotheist in history, fine, but *prophet* for islam means something specific.\n\n>So if Islam copied Zoroastrianism why didn’t they call it out?\n\nHow would you know that some didn't, just because 1 or 2 people joined (and recieved political power out of it so...) doesn't mean others didn't call it out.",

But Afghans do acknowledge their Zoroastrian heritage with things from our culture. Main thing is it doesn’t really seem that the Zoroastrians mind that Islam was similar to their beliefs they still converted.\n\nYour arguments are based on your tunnel visioned view of Islam. Because In Islam we believe that Moses was a Prophet and his nation and early followers were Muslim. We believe Jesus and his early followers were Muslim. However we believe the holy scriptures that had and message was slowly slowly corrupted. You see Muslim usually have a big problem with Christians because they started worshipping a prophet of god not God himself and went even further when they started the trinity belief of God. Islam is has so much more depth then what you think. It didn’t just start with our Prophet Muhammad(pbuh) in the middle of a desert.",

It's the literal same type of argument, and is in all senses of the term a cop out.\n\n>Your arguments are based on your tunnel visioned view of Islam.\n\nNo it's not.  I haven't provided enough here for you to reach that conclusion.  I have just stated that saying \"whenever there is any vague similiarity in history to what I'm saying, its because other prophets came and therefore proof, but ignore the differences because um, corruption, and ignore the fact that you can trace out the commonalities regionally\".\n\n> Because In Islam\n\nI've read the Quran, I appreciate but don't require the coles notes.\n\n\n>Islam is has so much more depth then what you think.\n\nI'm well aware of the faith, I'm also aware of the false claims to scientific miracles it makes and where the actual source material originated.",

The common claim is that the Quran contains knowledge that would have been impossible to know at the time, and i'm saying thats absolutley false.  For specific things it gets wrong, it messes up the Jesus birth story by borrowing from an aporchyal source, and presents a geocentric view of the solar system.\n\n>You can’t make these claims without giving your evidence for this.\n\nAgain, backwards.  Someone doesn't prove that a book is **not** miraculous, the default position is that a written work is man made until proven otherwise.  You would agree with me with almost any other document.",
