    "post_text ": "I find it interesting that if we map out what we would expect a man-made religion to look like, we find that every currently existing religion fits nicely on that map. When I say man made, I refer to any religion that was either intentionally created or that naturally evolved from myth, legend, etc.  \n\n1.  We would expect this religion to originate in one single geographical spot. \n\nA man made religion can’t simultaneously originate around the world. It can only start where the people who made it live. For example, we would expect that Judaism only originates in Northern Africa. We would not expect to see evidence of people in South America worshiping the same god in the same way with the same rules at the same time. \n\n2. We would expect it to be a product of the time and culture it originated from.\n\nA man made religion would be influenced by the culture and time surrounding it. The morals it taught would align with or directly counter what existed around it. The religion would only address things relevant to those people right then and there.  For example, we would expect Buddhism to have a lot to say about the cycle of reincarnation since this was culturally relivent in India when Buddhism originated. We would not expect Buddhism to directly address things like democracy because that wasn’t really relevant to their culture at that time.\n\n**Edit:** someone who knows more about ancient Indian history actually pointed out that some democratic societies did exist at the time and some ancient Buddhist texts discuss it. That’s my bad for not researching more. Maybe a better example would just be to say that Buddhism didn’t emphasize the importance of things like rituals to contact your ancestors because ancestors weren’t as culturally important in that specific way as some of the lore eastern cultures. Buddhism still focused and emphasized ideas relevant to India at the time, which also includes any counter cultural aspects of the religion, as counter cultural movements are still a product of the culture they are countering. \n\n3. We would expect it to only spread through natural means.  \n\nA man made religion would only be able to spread naturally.  Cultures and places outside of where it was first created would not learn of the religion until people from that original culture interacted with those new people.  For example, we would expect Japan wouldn’t know about Islam until it had interactions with other people who had heard of it. We would expect knowledge of Islam to move in a mostly linear fashion out from the Middle East to the rest of the world. We wouldn’t expect Japan to suddenly learn of Allah right when Muhammad first starts preaching. \n\nIt should be cause for concern for theists that every single currently existing religion fits this perfectly. This doesn’t definitively prove anything.  However, it should lead theists to ask themselves why their religion looks just like what a man made religion would  look like.",

Not sure about the argument relating to time and culture either. Do you think laws relating to cryptocurrency would be revealed to people at a time when they spent gold coins? Like that just doesn’t make sense. Where else would the religion cultivate? Cultural aspects will be a part of it regardless so long as humans are the ones observing it so that’s a hollow argument as well.\n\n3.

Now to your points.\n\n> Not sure what your argument is about a singular location. If a person is sent to guide/warn people do you expect them to teleport to multiple places or something? Especially if multiple people were sent to various places, this is hollow argument.\n\nMan-made religions start with one person or group of people, in one place, and are forced to spread via human means, IE evangelism or conquest. This is how fake religions must spread.\n\nAll religions we know about follow this pattern.\n\nIt's possible that the One True Religion's God chose to follow this pattern for some *really good reasons*, but in so doing, they satisfied the OP's claim that it follows the pattern of a man-made religion.\n\n>Not sure about the argument relating to time and culture either. Do you think laws relating to cryptocurrency would be revealed to people at a time when they spent gold coins? Like that just doesn’t make sense. Where else would the religion cultivate? Cultural aspects will be a part of it regardless so long as humans are the ones observing it so that’s a hollow argument as well.\n\nSame as the above. There might be really good reasons that the One True Religion's God chose to not reveal any extra-cultural information (like, say, warn His People about germs), but the fact is that no religion on the planet has a god that has done so. All religions feature Gods that do not reveal extra-cultural information. This doesn't prove any one of those religions false, but it satisfies OP's claim.\n\n>Still not sure what your argument is about spreading by natural means. Do you expect the mycelium of mushrooms underground to convey a message meant for humans in a language we can understand? You’re gonna be the one to convey the message not your cat or some alien so yet another hollow argument.\n\nThis, again, is an excuse for why the One True Religion's God chose to reveal His Message in a manner totally indistinguishable from a manmade religion.\n\nIn sum: The fact that we can make up reasons why Our Preferred Religion's God chose to make their One True Religion look as man-made as all the others doesn't change the conclusion that all religions look man made.",

I'm litterally frustrated because i don't get it. Why aren't you sure what are the arguments while everyone else is sure? Is your faith so strong that you can't see his point or what? I'm not mocking or anything i'm genuinely curious and can't find any answer it seems related to the biased perspective but still don't get how this easy and simple argument OP gave can be confusing in anyway. Not to mention that i had many debates with religious people and it keeps popping out of no where everytime there is a good argument.",

If your religion claims a god that is:\n\n* Everywhere at once\n* All-powerful\n* In control of many henchmen\n* Capable of telepathy, or\n* Interested in getting the message to everyone\n\nThen its god should absolutely be able to tell everyone at once. Or at least in a timely manner such that no one dies before getting the message.\n\nSecond: Yes. If your religion claims a god that is all-knowing, then the future should not be an exception. Nevermind that your example doesn't work even for a god that isn't. Tell me, what traits of humanity analogous to cryptocurrency have sprouted up in the last 2000 years that the people of the time couldn't have understood, and what new laws has any religion proposed to deal with them?\n\nThird: See the first. If your god is sufficiently powerful, then both the initial message and spread should not require word of mouth.",

That what Christians call “god” was at one point as much a mortal man as anyone else. And that performing their Freemason-inspired rituals means when a person dies they get to become a god in the same sense and create other worlds with humans elsewhere in the universe.\n\nMy other point still stands though. Think about it:\n\n- if he’s perfect, anything he makes “in the image of” something else will also necessarily be a perfect replication\n\n- ergo, if he makes something in the image of himself, it *must* be equal to him\n\n- otherwise, he himself is not perfect\n\nAnd you can’t argue it’s purely meant as visual, since we don’t all look like clones. We aren’t all born with the same body structure, or even all of our body structure. So none of that can be what’s referred to by “image.” It must be in the immortal, spiritual sense.
