    "post_text ": "The issue with christianity is that nearly nothing in the faith is universally accepted.  \nTrying to have civil discourse about a faith that has not figured itself out is ridiculous.\n\n  \nOn these reasons:\n\n1. There is no universally accepted bible.\n2. There is no universally accepted description or characteristics of their god.\n3. there is no universal acceptance on interpretations or whether the bible or the events within are literal or allegorical\n\nUntil there is a universally accepted bible from which we can draw information from, a universally accepted version, definition and characteristic of their god so we can identify it and discuss it properly, the faith is too incoherent to debate.",

There is no universal description or characteristics of their god.  LOL.  The answer for number 1 will work for this also.\n3. there is no universal acceptance on interpretations or whether the bible or the events within are literal or allegorical.  LMAO.  the same answer for both 1 and 2 can work for this also.(sarcasm is being used for these 3 points)\n\nYour ignorance is to be expected as even the entire Christian world for most part is apostate.  But  let me assure you that those 3 points are trivial and can be researched easily for the answers.  Let me give something to think on:\n\n1. First problem with your \"universally accepted bible\" is that even if everyone on the planet including Past, present and future accepts a particular translation does not authenticate the accepted version.\n2. Once you authenticate the Bible the rest of your query goes out the door.\n3. BTW, the Bible can be authenticated and through scientific means proven.",

If I say I have captured the lockness monster and she is in my pool, hopefully you dont just take me at my word. I am making the claim. It is on me to prove it.
