    "Post_Title": "Christians should stop quoting the Bible in every debate saying \"it's God's word\", as if that settled it, since the Bible is just a compilation of books made by men to interpret God's will",
    "post_text ": "Throughout my life I have encountered christians who do truly believe in God but who don't even care about what the Bible says regarding every single aspect of life (my own parents are like that, for instance).\n\nThere are, however, people who unironically quote texts written centuries or even milleniums ago to justify their opinions in the 21st century AD (like that Leviticus verse that is often quoted to justify opposing to homosexuality). People who do this say that the Bible is \"God's word\", as if the Bible wasn't a man-made compilation of books made to interpret God's will. As a man-made compilation of books, there are some big issues with it that should be enough for any person to not use it to justify their opinions:\n\n-As Humanists pointed out, the Bible is full of contradictions. Facts that are stated in a chapter contradict what other chapter says a few pages later. The book of Genesis is full of these contradictions, like saying that God created light on the first day and a few pages later saying He created it on the fourth. God's word can't be contradictory, for He is supposed to be a perfect being, human words, however, can be contradictory and misleading.\n\n-The Bible as we know it today is not the original Bible, since both the Catholic and Protestant Church have removed more than a dozen books from it during Church Reforms or Bible translations. It's curious how ordinary men get to decide which texts are \"God's word\" and which aren't. What if the  quotes you often use nowadays to justify your opinions got removed in the 17th century AD? Would you now be free to have your own opinion on the matter?\n\n-People have used Bible texts in the past to oppose scientific facts: they opposed the Theory of Evolution, they opposed people who said the Earth was not the center of the Solar System, they opposed people who said that the Earth is actually way older than the Bible says it is (like millions of years older)... Only fanatics nowadays use religious text to oppose scientific facts, but somehow people still think it makes sense to use those texts to make up your personal morality and ethics.\n\n-The Bible, as every single book that was written throughout history, reflects the way of thinking the authors and the people of their time had. If Jesus was born a thousands years later, the people who would have written the Bible would have had different values than the people of 2000 years earlier, and thus the book would have conveyed different values as well. The Bible is full of quotes about rejecting homosexuality, women having to submit to men, masters owning slaves... just because as every book it reflects the values of the time it was written at, not because it contains some kind of timeless and universal truth regarding ethical behaviour. \n\n\nIn conclusion, using the Bible to make up your morality and ethics is downright absurd, and you can be a christian and follow God's will without having to follow 2000 year old texts contained in man-made, contradictory and revised books. As my Religion teacher said when I went to primary school, the Bible is just an interpretation of God's word. It has historical, cultural and religious value, but shouldn't be used in any case as a History book or as a morality code to justify opinions in the 21st century AD.",

For the Christian, that worldview is that Scripture/Bible is the unquestionable authority that is presumed true. For the Muslims, it’s the Koran. For atheists, it’s naturalism.\n\nSo, we all do the same thing, using a different worldview. Why bash Christians for doing something you and everyone else does, too, OP?",

So if you believe the story of Genesis and then you begin studying biology and come to understand the theory of evolution, you can still believe in the story of Genesis, but obviously you wouldn't believe it literally.",
