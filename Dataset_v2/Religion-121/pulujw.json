This is why the courts treat atheism as a religion under the law - it's much better for y'all.\n\nYou don't want to be called a religion, which I get, but you really do want to be \"lumped in\".\n\n>Atheism doesn’t resemble organized religion in any way\n\nReligion doesn't need to be organized.\n\n> and there are no collective goals it seems.\n\nReligion doesn't need collective goals.\n\n> Christians often try to incorrectly categorize it as a religion to promote their own ideologies.\n\nTrue.

If I say I don't believe Biden in president, no reasonable person would interpret that to mean I have no beliefs on the matter at all. This is a relatively recent turn where atheists have tried to rebrand atheism as agnosticism to avoid the chance they might be wrong, not realizing that this means they can't be right.",

In most cases, as you gather more evidence, you converge upon the right answer. With the gumballs, no evidence is useful until you have collected 100% of the evidence.\n\nFor the analogy to be apt, the question of God's existence would have to work the same way, but it doesn't. People look for contradictions or confirmations in the Bible, and so forth, and make their conclusions based on if there is more evidence or against God existing.\n\n> It seems you have trouble understanding it.\n\nDon't make statements like that.",

This is actually a fundamental problem in your argument and in the argument of people that try argue the same thing. There is actually empirical evidence involved the discussion of \"chicken pox causing shingles\". So people can make claims about that and then support them. If there wasn't evidence that chicken pox caused shingles then of course we would (or at least could) interpret it as lacking belief in such a thing.\n\nThis example (as well as every other example i've seen to try and make the point you are making) fails miserably to analogize the two because there is evidence involved in all of them where there is NOT in discussing the existence of a god.\n\nThere is NOT empirical evidence of a god. But there isn't evidence AGAINST a (deistic) god existing either. So I, as an atheist, am in no position to make a claim about that. Which means I literally LACK belief in gods, but do not claim that no gods exist. (which is what happens when you make a positive statement about belief.)\n\n>then you have people like /u/Kevidiffel and /u/Electrivire finding it \"scary\" that a mod of a debate subreddit is using the correct terms from philosophy.\n\nYes. Absolutely it is scary.

I don't know if you are truly ignorant and just have never been challenged on your viewpoints because you are a mod or if you are actually being disingenuous and just choosing not to engage with how the terms are ACTUALLY used (the ONLY way they can be used mind you), but either way you really MUST be better.

Atheists are, simply, not theists.\n\n\\* By \"long needed\" I mean that the linear theist-agnostic-athiest model was insufficient because of how people understood the terms as believing in god, believing (specifically) there is no god, and not knowing either way. Under that model the vast majority of non-theists would be considered agnostic and left in the wishy-washy, 50/50 chance either way, \"I don't know\", undecided position, leaving others with the impression they just needed to be proselytized to.\n\nMeanwhile, those non-theistic \"agnostics\" were often well-read regarding religion, and certain that ideas about god/s were man-made and flawed. Yet neither were they entirely convinced there were no god/s.\n\nThey did not neatly fit the theist-agnostic-atheist model as it was understood. So when the knowledge+belief model was proposed (gnostic/agnostic + theist/atheist), they could finally get away from the impression they were always on the brink of believing (believing in a god, or believing god/s did not exist) by saying they were agnostic-atheist (God/s may or may not exist. I neither believe in god/s nor do I believe god/s do not exist.).\n\nIf I could draw a comparison: Scientific theories, particularly in biology, can be so well supported they can be taken as fact, but are not considered final or unchangeable - there may be something yet to be discovered that diverges from the conclusions of the theory, or a theory proposed that better explains the facts. That is intellectual honesty. Similarly, many of those who live without belief in god/s as if it were fact acknowledge we may yet discover god/s. Such a position is not undecided, 50/50, or \"I don't know\", but an intellectually honest position where the tentative conclusion that there is insufficient reason to believe in god/s has been reached.",

Saying \"i do not know\" is not an answer. A(gnosticism) speaks directly about knowledge of any subject (typically associated with the existence of god) it is not used speak to belief in any context.\n\nSo no, it is not a \"rebranding\".
