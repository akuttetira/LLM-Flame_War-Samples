    "post_text ": "Every major religion is guilty of doing this shit. Eg: the ones that say that if you do it then you'll have to face eternal damnation and the ones that say that you'll be reborn as an animal and suffer life again or stuff like that.\n\nUnfortunately I have had those kind of thoughts. I can tell you that having people preaching their believes about those kind of actions (suicide) makes you feel even more scared, pressured and even hopeless at the idea that it can't be considered as an option. I tend to be more obsessive-oriented (I'm getting better at it tho) by nature so, especially when i'm in not good mental states, I buy more easily into those irrational stories made up by religious people.\n\nThe most liberating thing for me, weirdly enough, is opening up to the idea that instead suicide can be an option (I also talked about this with the therapist). I mean, we will die anyways one day sooner or later. I found a lot of freedom, relief and therefore even healing in philosophies like stoicism and other authors. For example, the ideas of Marcus Aurelius (my personal favourite) or Alber Camus will simply acknowledge that suicide can absolutely be an option. Should you do it? No, none of them says that you should kill yourself, but they do say something on the lines of \"if life because unlivable because of physical or mental constrains, then you have the right to exit it peacefully\" (Marcus Aurelius - Meditations).",

When I was in the army I saw several suicides. After I got out, guess what, for some reasons beyond my understanding suicide started to seem like a good idea. So one day I loaded a shotgun and put it under my chin and started yelling uncontrollably for some reason (maybe to psych myself up?) know what helped me? My wife rushed in, hugged me, and said “if you pull the trigger you kill both of us” . Now what she did was not safe and no one should ever handle that situation that way, but the fact that it did saved my life. And that is where my Reddit name came from. I plan to be here next year , and the one after that. But I would be fibbing if I said that experiencing those suicides didn’t effect me permanently. The thought still passes through my mind most days. I just had to come up with my own reason for not killing myself. My reason is not going to be the same for everyone else.",

If life was that easy no one would be suicidal or suffering. It’s a complex issue and you know nothing about it yet blame the victims for their suffering and that they tell others that want to “help” by stigmatising mental illness that they should stop is somehow wrong?\n\nDo you also tell boys that break their legs to “walk it off” and stop “whining”? You’re horrible",
