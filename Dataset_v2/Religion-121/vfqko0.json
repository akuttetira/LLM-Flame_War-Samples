    "Post_Title": "Noah's Flood didn't happen",
    "post_text ": "Noah's flood is the event described in the Bible of the entire world* being flooded by God to kill all the bad people. The thing is, that definitely did not happen. \n\nFor one thing, the Bible says the water covered \"every mountaintop\" (Gen 7:20). That would include Mount Everest, which is 8000 meters above sea level. If you do some basic math (which I will show if need be it's just kinda annoying to do algebra on Reddit) about how much water you would need to cover the Earth in a 8000 meter high shell of water. You get 6 × 10^22 kg of water! That's 10 percent the mass of the entire planet. The amount of water on Earth right now is 1.35 × 10^21 kg, about 2 percent of what is needed. And because a 6 trillion trillion kg of water can't magically disappear, safe to say that every mountaintop was not covered in water, ever.\n\nThere are also other problems with the entire planet drowning. Every fish would die from the mixture of salt and sea water. What the Bible means be \"2 of each animal\" is unclear. If we take that to mean 2 of literally every species the ark simply isn't big enough, and it's not even close. If it means 2 of each \"kind\" of animal as some apologists suggest, that still doesn't solve the issue. Even if I put aside that no one seems to ever actually define what a kind is, you cannot go from 2 of a species to billions of that species, the population would die out after only a handful of generations. Even if it didn't, we can tell when a species has undergone a genetic bottleneck. Cheetah DNA, for exmaple, is much more similar between two Cheetahs than DNA between two humans are. There are not signs of an extreme genetic bottleneck in literally every species ever.\n\nThe keen eyed among you would have noticed that I put an asterisk when I said the whole world was flooded. That's because some people think the flood was a local flood that just wiped out all of human kind, but not literally flooded the whole world. That still is impossible.\n\nFor one thing, when would that flood take place? Creationists usually put the flood about 4000 years ago, and by that point humanity was already living literally everywhere habitable to humans.  If the flood happened 100,000s of years ago when humanity was still just in Africa, then how did Noah run aground on Mount Ararat? If the flood waters were so bad they literally drowned a continent it would be pretty obvious to geologists nowadays and definitely did not happen for several of the same reasons I mentioned above. There is just no time for a local flood to kill every human and keep the rest of the details the Bible is very happy to provide. If the flood was meant to just kill those in Noah's region, around Iraqish given he ran aground on Mount Ararat, he could've just told Noah to, you know, leave. He told Lot to GTFO when he was burning two cities to the ground, why not do the same for Noah and co?\n\nThere are also people who think the flood was purely a metaphor for something or other. And to those people, you can move along. The thesis is \"the flood didn't happen\" if you think the flood is just a story to teach a lesson then we agree on at least that point and this post isn't targeted at you.\n\nTl;dr there was no flood as described in the Bible.",

                    "Reply_Text": "It isn’t even a debate in Christianity either. No Christian churches insist on a literal interpretation of the flood story as a literally Earth-wide event, and none ever have.\n\nThat’s the case if we define Christianity as the beliefs of the ancient Christ worshipping communions still extant. Of course if we define Christianity as evangelical fundamentalism or ‘whatever anyone who calls themselves Christian says they believe’ then that would make it virtually impossible to narrow down a set of beliefs to judge… as people who claim to be Christianity are all over the map with their beliefs about God and interpretations of the Bible.\n\nIf Christianity is anything objectively, though, it is ancient. As far as what I will call ‘Christianity’ (defined as the beliefs of the ancient Christ worshipping communions still extant), that’s basically orthodoxy (Oriental and Eastern) and catholicism (Roman and Eastern). In none of those communions is it insisted that people take the flood account literally. To the contrary, in all those communions there is a long history of keeping an open mind to figurative views of the Old Testament.\n\nThe idea that Noah’s flood must be taken as a literally worldwide event is a redneck protestant pipedream, a hillbilly baptist blunder. It has nothing to do with Christianity unless we take Jerry Falwell at his word (that is, unless we believe his claim that he is a Christian and that what he teaches is ‘Christianity’).",

These people back then had no reason to discard any part of their holy book in the name of science, since they didn’t have the science to disprove it.\n\nI can name many early Christian church fathers who believed in a literal flood:\n\n> **Justin Martyr** (103–165) affirmed the universality of the Flood when he wrote that ‘the whole earth, as the Scripture says, was inundated, and the water rose in height fifteen cubits above all the mountains’.\n\n> **Theophilus** (c. 115–185), Patriarch of Antioch, noted the belief of the Greek philosopher Plato that the Flood ‘extended not over the whole earth, but only over the plains, and that those who fled to the highest hills saved themselves.’\n\n> But he rejected these ideas saying: ‘But Moses, our prophet and the servant of God, in giving an account of the genesis of the world, related in what manner the flood came upon the earth, telling us, besides, how the details of the flood came about, and relating no fable of Pyrrha nor of Deucalion or Clymenus; nor, forsooth, that only the plains were submerged, and that those only who escaped to the mountains were saved. And neither does he make out that there was a second flood: on the contrary, he said that never again would there be a flood of water on the world; as neither indeed has there been, nor ever shall be.’\n\n> **Tertullian** (c. 160–225), the prolific Carthaginian apologist, spoke of fossils in the mountains testifying to a time when the globe had been covered by water. ‘There was a time when her whole orb, withal, underwent mutation, overrun by all waters. To this day marine conchs and tritons’ horns sojourn as foreigners on the mountains, eager to prove to Plato that even the heights have undulated.’\n\n> **Gregory of Nazianzus** (329–389) described Noah as one ‘entrusted with the saving of the whole world from the waters’ and as having escaped the destruction ‘in a small ark’.\n\n> **John Chrysostom** (c. 347–407), Archbishop of Constantinople, wrote concerning the Flood: ‘See the precision of Scripture, how it not only taught us the year of the deluge but also made clear the month and the day.’\n\n> **Augustine** (354–430), Bishop of Hippo, rejected the exclusively allegorical interpretations of the Flood account by commentators who supposed ‘that there could not be a flood so great that the water should rise fifteen cubits above the highest mountains’.\n\n> **Pseudo-Eustathius** (c. 375–500) even pointed to fossils as evidence of the Flood: ‘Since the waters covered the summits of the mountains, they were covered over and hidden by their flowing. For in these times of ours also, on the summit of Mt. Lebanon, men who cut stone for marking boundaries find various types of marine fishes, which must have been gathered together in the caves of the mountains when they were caught in the mud.’\n\n> **Procopius of Gaza** (c. 465–528) did likewise: ‘It can be shown clearly in many other ways that a universal flood came upon the earth, by which those people are persuaded who believe with difficulty that these things were explained by Moses. For even today, in mountains that are lofty and difficult to climb, marine remains are found, that is, shells and fragments of tortoise shells and other such things, which even we ourselves have seen.’\n\nChristians have always believed in a literal flood from the founding of their religion. This is what the vast majority believed all the way up until the 20th century.",

My definition is certainly more narrow than ‘whatever is believed by anyone who says they worship Jesus Christ.’ On the other hand, it is less narrow than “only Roman Catholics.”\n\n> It is true that no Christian church makes or has made the literal reading of the flood a matter of dogma.\n\nActually I’ve been to protestant (fundy) churches that insisted on a literal reading.\n\n> However it is also true that the ancient consensus of the church is that the physical foods did happen\n\nNo it isn’t.\n\n> From Clement of Rome at the beginning of the first century: Noah, who was found to be faithful through his service, proclaimed a new beginning to the world; and through him the Master saved the living creatures that entered the ark in harmony – 1Clement 9\n\nRelating a story as it was told, one that may have been literal or figurative when first told, is not any sort of insistence that it be taken literally.  Similarly just because Jesus cited passages about Adam doesn’t mean he thought a human named Adam was actually instantaneously created from dirt as the Genesis story goes. Adam could be figure, and so someone referring to Adam doesn’t necessarily mean they insist we take Genesis literally.\n\n> Do you agree with Augustine’s last sentence?\n\nDepends how you interpret it. I don’t think Augustine was insisting on a reading of Genesis that insists events happened literally as described. He explains in chapter one of the book you cited, “In the case of a narrative of events, the question arises as to whether everything must be taken according to the figurative sense only, or whether it must be expounded and defended also as a faithful record of what happened. No Christian will dare say that the narrative must not be taken in a figurative sense. For St. Paul says: ‘Now all these things that happened to them were symbolic.’”\n\nSo I don’t think the “this” he said we cannot doubt is that the entire world, as in literally the planet Earth, was flooded during the time of Noah. In the same work Augustine wrote, “… we find in Holy Scripture passages which can be interpreted in very different ways without prejudice to the faith we have received. In such cases, we should not rush in headlong and so firmly take our stand on one side that, if further progress in the search of truth justly undermines this position, we too fall with it. That would be to battle not for the teaching of Holy Scripture but for our own, wishing its teaching to conform to ours, whereas we ought to wish ours to conform to that of Sacred Scripture.”",

This is just the same Augustine who said, “No Christian will dare say that the narrative must not be taken in a figurative sense. For St. Paul says: ‘Now all these things that happened to them were symbolic,’” and “… we find in Holy Scripture passages which can be interpreted in very different ways without prejudice to the faith we have received. In such cases, we should not rush in headlong and **so firmly** take our stand on one side that, if further progress in the search of truth justly undermines this position, we too fall with it.”\n\nSure Augustine had an opinion on the debate as far as how much of the narrative was history (‘really happened’) and how much was not history (‘means something besides really happened’). The point wasn’t to not have an opinion, even one systematically developed. It was to not hold it too firmly.  So I believe even he wouldn’t have insisted City of God was some sort of creed regarding Christian historical certainty. Christianity has long had the primary things it considers to have really happened in creeds and such. It has also long had allowance for various opinions on many other things.  Augustine had many opinions and wasn’t shy about sharing them. I think it is a mistake to then presume that every ancient Christian who mentioned something Augustine once talked about had his exact opinion about it, whether with regards to his controversial views on sexuality, his historical opinions, nor anything else.\n\n> You could just say all these men were just ignorant and wrong about the facts;\n\nHuh? What does that have to do with anything? You could call me ignorant too. But you didn’t. And likewise I didn’t call anyone ignorant either.\n\nAugustine was probably wrong about some things… any human is. For instance he also was convinced God considered it a sin for a husband to have sex with his pregnant wife. Most don’t think that any more, and I see no reason to think God has ever said that or even implied it. Nonetheless, that doesn’t mean I think he is ignorant. He came from a different time, had different experiences. It is what it is. Just because I think he was wrong about a few things doesn’t mean I think he was ignorant. It means I think he was human. And I bet he would’ve admitted to you he was a human too, and by that I mean prone to mistake, if you would’ve asked even him. That was his whole point in explaining the Christian tradition of trying not to be too firm in personal opinions about Old Testament narratives’ historicity versus their symbolism, not too firm to be unable to have one's mind changed by truths that are later established. So were he alive today, then even he (by his own implicit admission) would likely expect to have his mind changed about some of his earlier opinions about the old testament. He openly believed that the certain understanding of such things was not yet fully established, even while he opined about his views concerning them, and admitted the certain understanding would (or at least could) be better established *with time*.",

I could be like you and blindly assume you’re being a coward by excluding sects based on what you like and don't like. But unlike you, I don’t reason by way of assuming my conclusions. Neither of us are being cowards. We simply are using different working definitions of a word.\n\n> I believe these two beliefs are the core of what makes a Christian a Christian.\n\nGood for you.

The no true Scotsman (NTS) fallacy is not when you use a different definition than me. The NTS fallacy is not when you use one definition of a word and stick with it while someone else uses another definition and sticks with that. The NTS fallacy is when one of them doesn’t stick with her own definition she started with, moving the goal posts by changing her own definition in response to examples that fit her previous definition.\n\nIf someone told us they were from Canada that may be all you need to define them as Canadian, but the State Department may need a little more evidence than that before calling them Canadian by their definition. If you wanted to just let the word be defined purely by self identification, you’d be welcome to, but it still wouldn’t be fallacious for the State Department to disagree with you about that definition either. They may prefer a more objectively observable definition, like certain proofs of national citizenship, to avoid a subjective mess of often contradictory ideas constituting what 'Canadian' means, what ‘Canadian’ even is, and how to deal with the concept rationally in the real world.\n\n> If they are followers of Christ,\n\naccording to who? That’s the problem.\n\n> then IMHO they qualify as Christian.\n\nSo basically what you’re saying is if you think they follow Christ they are a Christian.  So you just have a different definition of Christian than the more objective one I proposed.",

That's literally one possible definition. And other dictionaries have slightly different definitions. MW's definition is one possible way to define the word, and that particular one mentions groups that didn't even exist until 500 years ago... 'Protestants.' Christianity is ancient, and so are the catholic and the orthodox communions. Protestantism is 500 years old. Think about that for a couple seconds.\n\n> Christianity: the religion derived from Jesus Christ, based on the Bible as sacred scripture, and professed by Eastern, Roman Catholic, and Protestant bodies.\n\nWhat sense does it make to say Christianity is that which is professed by X, Y, and Z when Z didn't even exist for the first 1,500 years of Christianity? Not much. And once they came into existence, they were not allowed to commune in the ancient communions extant... precisely because according to the ancient communions extant what they believed and practiced was too different from them to consider them part of a Christian communion.\n\nBut okay... you can use that definition if you want to. That's probably the most politically expedient thing to do, if you'd prefer not stepping on any toes over the Reformation.\n\n> You’re just excluding Protestants because you don’t like what they believe about biblical inerrancy,\n\nI'm just defining Christianity by ancient communion instead of by that which is professed by ancient communions plus by Protestants.\n\n> but unfortunately for your POV fundie evangelicals define what Christianity is in the United States.\n\nYou can call that Christianity if you'd like. They'd sure like you to. They'd like you to call them \"pro life\" too, even though they'd better be characterized as quite the opposite imho.  I personally think they just like to grab labels they think puts them in a good light... but hey... call them what they like to hear if you want, or even believe them if you want. I personally see that as bizarro world Christianity, and historically that's the more accurate way to see it (since it isn't ancient, Christianity is ancient, and none of the ancient Christian communions still extant accept fundy evangelicals as communicants because they see their beliefs as too different from Christianity).",

In reality, there is a long tradition in Christianity of not insisting on a literal view of details in the Old Testament.\n\nAs Augustine explains in chapter one of his book about Genesis and literalness, “In the case of a narrative of events, the question arises as to whether everything must be taken according to the figurative sense only, or whether it must be expounded and defended also as a faithful record of what happened. No Christian will dare say that the narrative must not be taken in a figurative sense. For St. Paul says: ‘Now all these things that happened to them were symbolic.’”\n\nIn the same work Augustine wrote, “… we find in Holy Scripture passages which can be interpreted in very different ways without prejudice to the faith we have received. In such cases, we should not rush in headlong and so firmly take our stand on one side that, if further progress in the search of truth justly undermines this position, we too fall with it. That would be to battle not for the teaching of Holy Scripture but for our own, wishing its teaching to conform to ours, whereas we ought to wish ours to conform to that of Sacred Scripture.”\n\nSo there is a long tradition in Christianity supporting the idea that we need not (and should not) insist on particular literal interpretations of details in the Old Testament. Christianity is about a risen Christ. Evangelicals and fundys may like to pretend it is about a literally flooded planet or Eve literally being made from Adam’s rib…. but it isn’t.\n\n> If somehow we were able to find evidence Jesus never actually rose from the dead, that would all of a sudden become metaphorical too, right?\n\nMaybe in your imagination. In reality, while Christianity has insisted on a literal resurrection, it has never insisted on a literal planet-wide flood (**if** as I said above, we define Christianity as the beliefs of the ancient Christ worshipping communions still extant). Of course many modern evangelicals and fundys insist on a literal reading of the flood story and many others. But those groups aren’t Christian if we define Christianity as the beliefs of the ancient Christ worshipping communions still extant.",

I don't care if pretty much none of it happened in the past as read literally nor do I care if all of it did. I care about what it means *for what my God would have me believe, do, and think right now, with regards to loving Christ, which is loving neighbor as self.* Christianity has always been primarily about resurrection and love neighbor as self, the only command Christ said is like loving God and the command which Christ said all others fall under. While there has always been debates about many old passages (in fact Romans 14 was written about just a few of those to help people remember to have their opinions but not accuse one another over disputable matters), those have never been the highest principle... the 'what's this all about overall.'\n\nI mean... which thing? My yardstick for determining if the part in the old testament about God existing 'could actually be true' is my reasoning for my faith at all, which is my personal experiences with God. That's not really a yardstick for anyone else though, as they don't have my experiences.\n\nMy yardstick for the rest (like if there was a real flood or a figurative one, if someone actually named David actually killed someone named Goliath, etc.) is probably similar to many others (Christian or not). Is there any evidence it happened? If so, then yes. If not, and if it seems fantastical, then probably not. But I do believe in fantastical things (as I said, I believe God exists). I just don't see them as common so by default I tend to question their historicity.  Either way has no bearing on why I read the story as a believer in Christ in the first place though, which is not for historical jeopardy. I don't see history as the point of the stories. So I'm not reading for historical knowledge, rather for spiritual jeopardy, for spiritual knowledge, *for how to become more like those Christ praised in his teachings and exemplified, and less like those Christ condemned.*\n\n> How do you know the reliability of this method?\n\nI don't claim to know the reliability with which I am certain of the historicity of old testament narratives. That's because I sincerely don't care if they really happened in the past or not.\n\n> How do you know what did and didn't happen in the New Testament?\n\nI don't claim to know what exactly did and did not happen in places and times I was not. I believe Jesus Christ and Apostles existed because of history, and I am certain he exists (and is capable of the miraculous) because of personal experiences with whom I believe to be Jesus Christ and with whom I believe to be God's Spirit.\n\n> Did Jewish Zombies literally rise from their graves and walk the streets or didn't they?\n\nIf you have no reason to think so, then probably not from your perspective. I certainly believe resurrection is possible (obviously since I believe in Jesus Christ), and so I believe there may have been a few select Jewish zombies in addition to Jesus. That's due to personal experiences though... that's not something I think is currently objectively knowable in the sense of evident to all simply from reading some passage. If I were coming at the Bible without my personally lived out experiences, I would not believe a single one of the miracles alleged in the new or old testament. Indeed I was an atheist until I had personal experiences that changed my mind about the probability of supernatural things possibly occurring and about the probability of a certain deity existing. Without those experiences, I wouldn't believe... nor do I think I would have any reason to. So I don't claim the text of the Bible combined with this or that historical factoid is something that gives anyone the ability to \"know\" that anything fantastical or supernatural has or has not happened.\n\nSo while I personally believe resurrection is possible, and frankly I believe it is even probable, I don't claim that it is. In other words, I don't claim others have reason to think it is. I don't claim it is something that is objectively evident such that everyone should believe in it (much less claim to 'know' it). I just believe it, personally.\n\nEdit: I have apparently been blocked from replying below, so I'll reply to your below question here.\n\nyou asked,\n> so basically you believe everything because of an entirely subjective experience that you have no way to verify if it actually came from God or your own mind?\n\nTechnically all a person's experiences are subjective at least in the sense of experienced by the subject first and as the subjected saw it in their time and space. So subjective experiences can still have related details verified by more objective information. So no, I would not say there is no way for a subject to judge the probability of if it came from God or from the subject. Of course nothing can be judged as \"certainly\" God since God is supernatural, meaning at some point becomes beyond our understanding. The best one could do (logically, due to the definition of a supernatural God) is come to believe it almost certainly came from what they believe to be God.\n\nWe can understand what we can know about God. There are just things we can't know about God... since we are not the God (at least not yet).\n\n> But I don't think you can blame people who don't have these experiences for not buying it's all true.\n\nI don't. I never have and never would. I don't understand the reasoning of people who blame others for not believing. It seems more like emotional manipulation than reasoned discussion much of the time.\n\n> If it actually is God you experienced, why doesn't he do this for everyone?\n\nI don't pretend to know God's intentions. He may do different things for different people for different reasons. What God always does is cooperate with those who love their neighbor as themselves with a pure heart, meaning with selflessness, with good intention for others, because God is love.\n\n> Including alot of people who truly searched for him\n\nMaybe they will. Searching can't always mean finding immediately. The search must exist for some time that will always feel too long to the seeker. Perhaps some have found God but experienced it less specifically than another has, or more specifically but in other ways than another. So it is possible some have found what another would call God, but they call it different things. Ultimately God only knows why he cooperates with someone at the point in their lives God does, why not before, why at all, etc.",

In 2000 years if a large group of folks are insistent that Spider-Man existed because they have writings about him which are that old; there has been a Spider-Man cult for 2000 years; we have evidence that New York existed; lots of historical documents outside the direct writings about him talk about him; and Spider-Man gives them spiritual and moral comfort: Are they are believing truthful things?\n\nYou've defined Christianity from an obscure minority position, credit is due for offering a definition since you are aware that your definition is obscure. However, your definition is opaque at best. What do you mean by \"the beliefs of ancient Christ worshiping communions still extant\"? How can you validate those believes as truthful?",

                                    "Reply_Text": "> Interesting to note that Jesus believed in the flood (Matt 24:39).\n\nRelating a story as it was told, one that may have been literal or figurative when first told, is not any sort of insistence that it be taken literally. Similarly just because Jesus cited passages about Adam doesn’t mean he thought a human named Adam was actually instantaneously created from dirt as the Genesis story goes. Adam could be figure, and so someone referring to Adam doesn’t necessarily mean they insist we take Genesis literally.\n\nSame goes for Peter. Neither of those people insisted that they were not referencing symbolic mythology.\n\nAs Augustine explains in chapter one of his book about Genesis and literalness, “In the case of a narrative of events, the question arises as to whether everything must be taken according to the figurative sense only, or whether it must be expounded and defended also as a faithful record of what happened. No Christian will dare say that the narrative must not be taken in a figurative sense. For St. Paul says: ‘Now all these things that happened to them were symbolic.’”\n\nIn the same work Augustine wrote, “… we find in Holy Scripture passages which can be interpreted in very different ways without prejudice to the faith we have received. In such cases, we should not rush in headlong and so firmly take our stand on one side that, if further progress in the search of truth justly undermines this position, we too fall with it. That would be to battle not for the teaching of Holy Scripture but for our own, wishing its teaching to conform to ours, whereas we ought to wish ours to conform to that of Sacred Scripture.”\n\nSo there is a long tradition in Christianity supporting the idea that we need not (and should not) insist on particular literal interpretations of details in the Old Testament. Christianity is about a risen Christ. Evangelicals and fundys may like to pretend it is about a literally flooded planet or Eve literally being made from Adam’s rib…. but it isn’t.",

The world has remained the same since it began.\" (v4), and you're saying his rebuttal of this mockery is \"Haven't you read the myth?\n\nThat's not at all what I said.\n\nOf the mockers who will say Jesus is gone forever, Peter does not say, \"Haven't you read the myth,\" nor does he even say, \"Haven't you read about Noah?\" He says, \"... by the word of God the heavens were of old.\" Then he continues, \"... and the earth standing out of the water and in the water.\" He continues, \"Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished.\"\n\nSo basically, in other words, he responds, \"They forget God made the heavens happen, much less the earth. And not only that, but the parts of the earth that were out of water back then... they have been in water since then.\" He says nothing about Noah. And frankly, pretty much everywhere on Earth has been underwater at various points.... not necessarily because of Noah, but because of long term geology. That is obvious from seashells found where they shouldn't be, etc. So you are actually reading into Peter's words anything about Noah by performing a bit of 'gymnastics' with his actual explicit words, 'gymnastics' as some in this thread might call it (were they not in an echo chamber).\n\nTo you, what he means as a reply to the mockers seems to be kinda like, 'They forget God killed a bunch of people in Noah's flood.' To me, what he means as a reply to them is more like, 'They forgot that the God who made the space we live in operates on long timescales, but don't let that fool you in to thinking the God is not operating.' The wording itself doesn't explicitly support your interpretation, and the context actually lends itself more to my understanding... because it continues, \"beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The Lord is not slow concerning his promise, as some men count slowness; but is patient, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.\" While I will grant you that the best either of us can do is guess at Peter's meaning, obviously since it is a writing and he isn't here, the fact is the time he references is the creation, and he does not reference Noah's flood here in any explicit way. Also the context lends itself more to my interpretation of what he meant.\n\nEvidently he is not saying in reply to the mockers, \"Haven't you read this thing I consider a myth.\" He is saying, \"Don't forget, God literally made everything around us, and even the land you live on was once underwater. God appears very slow *from our reference frame*. Yet God is not slow in the reference frame that matters most since it is the one that will matter in the long run.\"",

That also assumes Peter had a modern evangelical protestant ‘Bible only’ mindset such that whatever he talked about had something to do with the Bible. That’s not how Christianity worked. Just because Peter expressed an idea doesn’t mean he was referring to ‘the Bible.’ His ancient communions believed lots of things that aren’t in the Bible. Their Bible is just a portion of their beliefs, not everything and the only thing they always are thinking about relating everything to like Jerry Falwell swinging a book around.\n\nHe expressed that everywhere has been underwater since it was created, in the context of God seeming so slow that he does nothing, but given time actually accomplishing big things.\n\n> when \"the world... perished\"\n\nThe entire world didn’t perish in Noah’s flood, not in the sense of everyone perishing. Some lived on in the story. On the other hand, the entire world that first existed since the beginning of the heavens and earth has been underwater at one point or another, and everything/everyone on any dry land in the beginning has long since died. Technically that’s all he says.\n\nYou need to read more into his words to get more than that out of it. I suppose telling yourself it couldn’t be more clear when it certainly could be may allow one to do that.\n\n> As an afterthought, I checked the NRSV on my desk and that mentions Noah too.\n\nIt translates the passage as ‘they forget Noah’? Or are you just telling me someone who wrote a side note in your NSRV mentioned Noah. If the latter, I don’t think any one editor or group of editors of study notes saying something is all it takes to be convinced they are right. Editors of various study notes in various Bibles often disagree so obviously no one group of them is likely to always be right.\n\n> Sorry *shrugs*. I am unconvinced of your argument.\n\nNo need to apologize. I appreciate the concern, but I don’t take any offense to someone disagreeing with me. Whether you are convinced of something, or aren’t, doesn’t have any bearing to me on whether it is reasonable.  If that were how I defined reasonable, I would just be a walking echo chamber of what other people are convinced of. That’s not how I aim to be. I don’t mind thinking for myself.",

The NTS fallacy is when one of them doesn’t stick with her own definition she started with, moving the goal posts by changing her own definition in response to examples that fit her previous definition.\n\nSaying I'm committing the NTS fallacy here would be like if you encountered someone at a bar who called themselves Canadian, and so you called them ‘that Canadian guy over there,’ and if a State Department employee needed more information requirements to be met than what someone calls themselves before calling someone Canadian, and you then accused the employee of the NTS fallacy. Many words have different definitions in different context, narrower and broader. Some words have a more formal definition used in one context and then a less formal one that is used in more practical conversation. Other words just have multiple definitions period, and one definition may be more broad or less than another definition, even of the same word. That isn’t fallacious. That’s just terminology differences.\n\n>  You claim no Christian churches believe in a literal global flood.\n\nI said \"if.\" Please don't put words in my mouth. You're leaving out parts of what I said.\n\n\"**if** we define Christianity as the beliefs of the ancient Christ worshipping communions still extant\" is what I said. **If** that, **then** \"no Christian churches insist on a literal interpretation of the flood story as a literally Earth-wide event, and none ever have.\" I continued, \"Of course **if** we define Christianity as evangelical fundamentalism or ‘whatever anyone who calls themselves Christian says they believe’ then that would make it virtually impossible to narrow down a set of beliefs to judge… as people who claim to be Christianity are all over the map with their beliefs about God and interpretations of the Bible.\n\nWhether fundamentalists and evangelical types are Christians is a debate that has been going on since they first appeared in history about 500 years ago (when the existing Christian communions kicked them out of communion... for not being what had been considered Christian until then). You having an opinion of what a Christian is that differs from mine is not the NTS fallacy, and me having an opinion of what a Christian is that differs from your's is not the NTS fallacy\n\n(I will alway reply to your below reply here… as I am apparently blocked from replying to you below)\n\n> Fine, let’s limit “real Christians” to Roman Catholics, Greek Orthodox, and Coptics,\n\nChristianity is Christianity. I didn’t suggest judging how ‘real’ or fake someone’s claim is, that’s you bringing that up. I fully support anyone’s right to call themselves a Christian. Even a real one. I just may not call them one. I may not call myself one depending on your definition of what it means.\n\nI suggested a different definition of an often generalized word, different than you use, a working definition of ‘Christianity’ that happens to be older than the modern one commonly used (which Christianity predates).\n\n> the three oldest denominations still in practice.\n\nThere are other extant Christ worshiping Oriental orthodox churches with ancient historicity besides the Coptics, but they are in communion with Coptics so okay. I mean basically what we’re saying, I think, is the ancient communions still extant, both Eastern and Western.\n\n> I think that is an incredibly narrow definition,\n\nIt could be narrower. Then again so could Jerry Falwell have been.\n\n> but I’ll humor you for now.\n\nThank you.\n\n>> none… insist on a literal interpretation of the flood story as a literally Earth-wide event\n\n> Both Greek Orthodox and Coptics hold that the flood was a global event,\n\nI know many Greek Orthodox, priests and a bishop, and Coptics too. What you’re saying is not true in my experience. They don’t “insist on a literal interpretation of the flood story as a literally Earth-wide event.” ‘Insist.’ *Some of them* believe it happened, in the sense of if they had to guess. Some don’t.\n\nMost of them don’t care if it actually did or didn’t happen that exact way. It ‘isn’t what Christianity is about’ in that sense, even though many Christians have an opinion one way or the other, even many Greek, Coptic, and Roman Christians. It’s basically always been that way in Christianity as defined this way.\n\n> Roman Catholics permit the interpretation that the flood was localized, which is different from them rejecting that the flood was global.\n\nNot in my experience. I have Roman catholic family. They are permitted all sorts of personal interpretations of Old Testament passages their bishops haven’t said must be interpreted a contrary way, this one included.\n\n>  If I move to Canada, adopt the local culture and customs, and reorient my whole life and identity around my new residence and eschew my old residence, am I not Canadian?\n\nDepends what definition we’re going to use as a working one for the conversation, ‘bar guy’s or ‘State Dept. guy at work’s.\n\n> I’m assuming you self-identify as Christian,\n\nI don’t call myself one personally. I meet the definition I try to use, and I don’t mind being called one if I meet someone’s definition, but I would refer to myself as a believer in Christ or a believer in Christianity. The term Christian as a personal title makes me uncomfortable. I have a working definition but the only person who’s working definition matters is Jesus Christ. The true Christian. And he has not yet said who is and who isn’t Christian. I meet my definition. I can only hope I will meet his.\n\n> and am further assuming that you believe there is a heaven that you will go to after you die.\n\nIn Christianity as I defined it, one can only hope they are personally judged worthy of heaven. One does not assume that is what Christ will decide. People are taught to assume themselves to be worthy of heaven after believing a prayer in evangelicalism. They aren’t taught to think that way in Christianity.\n\n> According to your beliefs, who else goes to heaven?\n\nWhoever Jesus decides should. According to Christianity, there are Saints unknown even to Christianity. The ancient communions extant all refer to them in ancient prayers.\n\n> How does one get there?\n\nLove. Hope. Faith. Perseverance.\nBy cooperating with what you perceive of the Holy Spirit, and Jesus Christ. Or by cooperating with what you know of God, in other words, who are also known as ‘love.’ Not everyone calls God the same thing all the time. God is Jesus, but God is also love. What each person has or hasn’t perceived of God, or of love, or of the Spirit, is only known to God. So it may be different for you than for me, what you are expected *by God* to do, to believe. *In the church*, we expect ourselves to believe in Christ and practice the sacraments. And most importantly of course for everyone, all God’s commands for everyone fall under love your neighbor as yourself, which is like loving God. Of faith, hope, and love, the greatest is love. Love is the primary way. Faith helps. ‘Christianity’ can help or hurt depending on how you define it.",

Seems straightforward.\n\n> A Mormon or Jehovah’s Witness have just as much cash value on being Christian as you do for the purpose of this debate.\n\nIf you define Christianity that way, instead of by ancient communion extant, as Christianity defined itself by since ancient times, then yes.
