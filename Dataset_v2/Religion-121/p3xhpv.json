    "Post_Title": "Slavery in holy books is evidence against god in the most fundamental way",
    "post_text ": "I am an ex-Christian and so my familiarity is only with that religion, but I think this applies to many monotheistic religions. \n\nChristians assert that god is \n1. All-knowing (1 John 3:20; Psalm 139:4; Hebrews 4:12-13) AND \n2. God is the literal embodiment of love (Ephesians 2 4-5; Psalm 136: basically all of 1 John 4 but especially verses 8 and 16)\n\nSlavery cannot exist when god is both of these things. God condemned people to slavery. Moses suggests taking female captives in Numbers 31. Deuteronomy is rife with instructions on what to do with people who have been conquered. Leviticus talks about the Israelites engaging in the slave trade. And it’s not just the Old Testament either! Jesus uses parables involving slaves to make his points too (See Matthew 18:21-35). Paul says to “be obedient to your human masters” in Ephesians 6:5-8. \n\n“But Peachcraft!” You say. “Many of these verses need to be put into context historically and culturally! The Bible says to treat slaves better/masters also have a Heavenly master to respond to/the slaves will enter the kingdom of god first/etc etc.” \n\nAnd to that I say: God knew we would inhabit a world without the need for slavery, if he was omnipotent. We cannot justify those morals historically if we believe that god transcends history and culture. Slavery is inherently evil and immoral practice.\n\nIf you think slavery can be justified in the Bible, I ask this question: will you be my slave, then? My servant? Even if it’s just for a “limited” amount of time? No? Why not? If god condones it what’s the problem?\n\nGod cannot be all-knowing and all-loving if he allows for slavery, and the very book says he did.",

            "Reply_Text": "About slavery, several points.\n\nThe word translated \"slave\" in Hebrew was mostly used for the word \"servant.\"  It is just like the way we use the word \"gay\" today vs a hundred years ago. Same word, but completely different meanings.\n\nThe Hebrew word usually translated slave designates a ‘subordinate,’ or someone who is under the authority of a person above him in a hierarchy.\n\nEven Moses is called a **servant** of God (**same exact Hebrew word as slave**) in Deuteronomy 34:5. So would you think of the Moses/God relationship in the same way you think of a slave/slave owner relationship? Of couse not. Moses was a servant/slave of God, but not in the same way as a slave in the American south.\n\nBecause the only thing the same is the five English letters in that word. That is the only similarity.\n\nThe American history and meaning of the word \"slave\" are completely different in Hebrew.\n\nYou do not get this understanding since the English translations only use either slave/servant for this Hebrew word.\n\nAdditionally, this verse shows that the American type of (kidnap and sell) slavery was **not allowed**, for the law makes no distinction between kidnapping foreigner or Israelite.\n\n**Both were capital offense crimes.**\n\nExodus 21:16 “**Anyone who kidnaps another** and either **sells him** or still has him when he is caught **must be put to death.**\"\n\n**Therefore, the entire American slavery system was illegal and punishable by death according to the Mosaic law.**  Most people do not realize this.\n\nWhen the Bible talks about this issue of servanthood, it is mostly talking about indentured servants. Much like people today joining the military for the only reason of needing a job. Many today are basically selling themselves as slaves to the government for the next four years for money. The government (military) owns them 24/7 for the next four years. You are **a slave to the Army for the next four years when you sign up**. In exchange for a paycheck.\n\nAnd if you think about it, where else where you going to find a paycheck in that time period?\n\nYou have to sell yourself to someone in order to gain money. It was not like jobs were everywhere.\n\nAlso, (this is important) to get an insiders view of how foreign \"slaves\" were looked at,\nnotice how Abram had a predicament.  A foreign \"slave/servant\" in Genesis 15.3 **is next in line to inherit his entire fortune.**\n\nBut Abram said, \"O Sovereign LORD, what can you give me since I remain childless and the one who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?\" **And Abram said, \"You have given me no children; so a servant (slave) in my household will be my heir.\"**\n\nThis really shows what is going on during this time with a \"slave\". This Eliezer was more like a servant who had now become almost a family member.  He was set to inherit everything.\n\nCan you imagine a slave owner in the 1800's south complaining that one of his \"slaves\" will \"inherit\" his entire fortune since he has no children?  Would never, ever happen.\n\nAlso, consider 1 Chronicles 2:34 where it says this:\n\n\"Sheshan had no sons--only daughters. He had an Egyptian servant named Jarha.\tSheshan gave his daughter in marriage to his servant Jarha, and she bore him Attai.\"\n\nAgain, the word there is the same word translated servant or slave. An Egyptian servant/slave being given the daughter of the family to marry.  Does this sound like the American system?\n\nThis is why we are wrong to project American southern slavery into ancient near east culture.  They were not the same situations at all.\n\nThe bible says that \"kidnapping slavery\" is a capital offense. Exodus 21.16.\n\nYet \"selling yourself\" for money or a debt was indeed allowable.\n\nNotice this interesting passage as well.... Notices how the person, man or woman, **\"sells themselves\"** as a slave (servant) to another.  It was done for money, **not kidnapping like in America.**\n\nDeuteronomy 15:12-13:\nIf any of your people—Hebrew men or women—sell themselves to you and serve (i.e. slavery) you six years, in the seventh year you must let them go free. And when you release them, **do not send them away empty-handed.** Supply them liberally from your flock, your threshing floor and your winepress...\"\n\nAgain, where in American history do we ever see\"slaves\" being treated like this?  After six years of \"slavery\" and their debt is paid, they are to be given a huge amount of provisions as they leave, as a send off.  Did this ever happen in America's history?\n\nAgain, when the Bible deals with  this issue of servanthood (slavery) it is **not equal to the same system of \"kidnapping  slavery\"** in the American south.\n\nIt is apples and oranges. It is like the usage of the word \"gay\" today vs a hundred years ago. Same word, completely different meaning.",

There’s not a single passage in the Old or New Testament that says that owning slaves is wrong but there are many that tell slaves to obey their masters. The only time that slavery is truly condemned is when the Israelites were slaves in Egypt. Apparently that was bad.",

They are to be treated as hired workers or temporary residents among you; they are to work for you until the Year of Jubilee.

And apparently that is evil.  You would not do that I guess.  And so, you are going to feed your family how back then?\n\n>consider evil\n\nIf you're an atheist, then evil doesn't exist. There is no good or evil, like no up,down in space.  Morality becomes subjective.\nCat killing a mouse not morally wrong.  If we are animals, then same thing is true.\n\n>something I and people like me think\n\nSure,  and that's the problem. You have your morality, Germany had their morality in WW2, every person has their own morality. So why should I trust yours?  As an atheist you're answerable to no one, you could do anything you want with a clean conscience.\n\n\nHere is why, if God exists (and I say if for your benefit, not mine) immorality arguments against God are not logical.\n\n1) The one who created the entire physical universe, from the macro  (universal planets, laws of physics, suns, galaxies) to the micro (quantum mechanics, cellular biology,etc.).... Things that the greatest minds in our world have barely scratched the surface of.  If you feel the One who created all these is going to say to you on that final day... \"Wow,  you know you're right.  I didn't think of what you thought of.  I should have done it your way.\"  That's never going to happen. It is illogical to me to hold that view.\n\n2) If God exists, then God also gave us a sense of morality, of right and wrong. So it is not logical that our morality would surpass the one who designed morality itself.  The branch of a tree will never be stronger than the tree trunk from which it originates from.\n\n3) **When we lack information about situation then we feel justified in calling it immoral.  This is not correct**\n\nFor instance a two-year-old might say that getting a vaccine is a very immoral thing. It causes them pain and suffering. Yet that is solely because **they lack the knowledge of why it's actually done.**\n\nWhen they gain the knowledge, at an older time in their life, they realize it was actually not an immoral thing done to them, but a necessary one.\n\nLet me give you another illustration. Removing the clothes off of people changes things. Let me explain what I mean.\n\nImagine this scenario happening only in men wearing underwear. And no background, or scenery information as well.  All on a plain white screen.\n\nTwo men in underwear are chasing another man in underwear. The two men are firing shots at the one man running. He is firing back at them. Is this situation immoral behavior for the two men?  Two against one is immoral, right?  A stronger team overtaking a weaker team. Immoral correct?  That is not fair!  Two against one is never fair, correct?\n\nNow let's put clothes on them. The two men are wearing police uniforms. The background, scenery information is this, the one man running away has just killed someone in a bank robbery.\n\nDo you see how **information changes the morality of a situation?**\n\nSo how does this apply to God?\n\nGod has complete understanding of every situation. You (nor I) don't.\n\nGod knows the end from the beginning. For us to stand in judgment of the one who created morality is simply illogical.  For us to say that something is wrong, with our limited knowledge, is incorrect.\n\nTo put it in very simplistic terms, whose thinking process is better?  The one with limited knowledge or the one who is omniscient? I will always choose God.  I may not understand it all, but from what I've seen in Creation, I can extrapolate and know, God knows what He's doing.",

So why should I trust yours?\n\nYou shouldn't.\n\nAnd I sure and heck don't trust yours, as I think your position on enslavement of humans in exchange for money indicates someone who is ethically deformed.\n\n>As an atheist you're answerable to no one, you could do anything you want with a clean conscience.\n\nI'm not an atheist.\n\n>Here is why, if God exists (and I say if for your benefit, not mine) immorality arguments against God are not logical.\n\nI don't care what you claim to know about the god Jehovah, as I don't think you are a moral person if you defend enslavement of humans.\n\n>The one who created the entire physical universe, from the macro  (universal planets, laws of physics, suns, galaxies) to the micro (quantum mechanics, cellular biology,etc.).... Things that the greatest minds in our world have barely scratched the surface of.  If you feel the One who created all these is going to say to you on that final day... \"Wow,  you know you're right.  I didn't think of what you thought of.  I should have done it your way.\"\n\nIf the god Quetzalcoatl or the goddess Andraste end up being the god or goddess that made everything, as their followers believe, and those gods and goddesses advocate cutting peoples hearts out and enslaving people, I will oppose them. I don't care if they have more power than I do. I'll still consider them evil. If Allah ends up being an actual god, then I'll oppose him in death too because I don't care if that god is powerful, if I think that god's behavior is wicked then I will oppose it. Same goes for whatever god or goddess you worship.\n\n>That's never going to happen.\n\nYou claim to know things you don't actually know about your god or goddess, and I'm not one of the people that is going to reward you for it like you have been most of your life.\n\n>It is illogical to me to hold that view.If God exists, then God also gave us a sense of morality, of right and wrong.\n\nI don't think whatever god or goddess you worship gave you an adequate sense of morality or of right and wrong.\n\n>So it is not logical that our morality would surpass the one who designed morality itself.\n\nI believe mine surpasses yours\n\n>The branch of a tree will never be stronger than the tree trunk from which it originates from.When we lack information about situation then we feel justified in calling it immoral.  This is not correct\n\nI don't care if you think that my calling your immoral behavior is actually moral. I don't care if a Stalinist thinks that my calling their immoral behavior is actually moral. I decide what I think is moral, and I think you, the Stalinists, the Maoists, the Muslims, and all the other people that defend the enslavement and subjugation of humans in exchange for money as moral disgraces.\n\n>For instance a two-year-old might say that getting a vaccine is a very immoral thing. It causes them pain and suffering. Yet that is solely because they lack the knowledge of why it's actually done.\n>\n>When they gain the knowledge, at an older time in their life, they realize it was actually not an immoral thing done to them, but a necessary one.\n\nI don't care if you or the stalinists, or Maoists, or Muslims or whoever claim that in the end your behavior is actually going to be shown to be moral. I think you and all those that defend subjugating humans as property are wicked.\n\n>Let me give you another illustration. Removing the clothes off of people changes things. Let me explain what I mean.... the one man running away has just killed someone in a bank robbery.\n>\n>Do you see how information changes the morality of a situation?\n\nNo. Your example is incorrect in all counts.\n\n>So how does this apply to God?\n\nI don't care if you or Muslims or Mormons or Catholics or Maoists or whatever you are claim to say your moral code, which I think is wicked, is actually moral according to the higher law of Mormonism or Islam or Maoism or whatever, because I think it's wicked and I am not going to reward those that claim that eventually the wicked behavior will be excused. Which is why I fight against the Maoists and Stalinists and people like you, because I don't believe you when you say subjugating people for money because of some greater law. I still consider your position wicked.\n\n>God has complete understanding of every situation. You (nor I) don't.\n\nI absolutely don't think yiou have an understanding of this situation, and if you do, then it would enhance what I consider the wickedness of your defense of human enslavement for money.\n\n>God knows the end from the beginning.\n\nI don't believe you when you claim to know things you don't actually know, because I don't consider your a human spokesperson for any gods or goddesses, Jehovah or Allah or otherwise.\n\n>For us to stand in judgment of the one who created morality is simply illogical.\n\nI stand in judgement of your position here, and you can call it illogical all you want. I'll call your position, and the Stalinist's position, and the Maoist's position, and the Wahabi Muslim's position all wicked, and you guys can all claim I can't judge any you because you believe you follow some higher law or some such nonsense, and I'll still call your positions wicked and evil and call repentance against them.\n\n> For us to say that something is wrong, with our limited knowledge, is incorrect.\n\nI think your moral beliefs are limited to the point of deficient, and I will absolutely call your behavior and the Stalinist's behavior and the Wahabi Muslim's behavior and the Maoists behavior wrong. And you and the Maoists will say \"oh, you don't know everything, so how can you be correct?\" and I will ignore your protests and your advocating moral relativism because people have limited knowledge and I will condemn your positions.\n\n>To put it in very simplistic terms, whose thinking process is better?\n\nMine.",

I'm the author of my morality, which is based on empathy and utilitarian pragmatism in accordance with reason and not some authority, neither human nor deity, who dictates what is morally good or evil.

[Exodus 21:4-7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+21%3A4-11&version=ESV) says that a daughter sold this way is a servant for life.\n\nBut there is also the blatant chattel slavery of foreigners. Foreigners were made slaves for life and even passed down as inheritance. They were bought and sold as property. Some were made slaves as captives of war.\n\nSee [Leviticus 25:44-46](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=leviticus+25%3A44-46&version=ESV):\n>As for your male and female slaves whom you may have: you may buy male and female slaves from among the nations that are around you. You may also buy from among the strangers who sojourn with you and their clans that are with you, who have been born in your land, and they may be your property. You may bequeath them to your sons after you to inherit as a possession forever. You may make slaves of them\n\nAnd [Deuteronomy 20:10-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+20%3A10-18&version=ESV):\n>When you draw near to a city to fight against it, offer terms of peace to it.
