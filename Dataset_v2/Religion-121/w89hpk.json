    "post_text ": "Phrases like “we don’t deserve love”, “we deserve wrath and punishment”, “this all makes sense because of the sins of the first people who where here on earth”… all remind me of what people in abusive relationships sound like. \n\nI guess it’s a way of dismissing or perhaps trying to make sense of the crazy amount of unfair suffering we witness here on earth. But to me it just doesn’t pass the sniff test. We shouldn’t have to jump through mental hoops if a creator loves us. \n\nSince when is it anyone’s fault for simply existing? We don’t by default deserve a creator’s punishment or wrath if for nothing else than the simple fact that we didn’t choose to be created in the first place. I’d expect a creator to be at the very least as forgiving as a human parent, but more ideally way more forging than that.",

            "Reply_Text": "A few thoughts from a Christian perspective: 1) The Bible never says God is Father to all. We are adopted into sonship when we profess Jesus Christ as Lord ( Ephesians 1:5-15); otherwise, we stand not as children of God, but children of wrath (Ephesians 2:3). This may be abusive, but it's important to underscore that each of our relationships with God varies SIGNIFICANTLY depending on whether we are saved or not (either we are His enemies, or His children); 2) I would maintain that most of the suffering in the world \\*is\\* the fault of humanity. Generally, every discussion I have with individuals who assert that people are principally good amounts to the fact that we aren't daily killing each other and that sometimes we put some change in the Salvation Army bucket. The bar is so low when it comes to our supposed selflessness and altruism; 3) Every week someone on this subreddit notes that God is too incomprehensible and great to care and love such small and insignificant beings like humans, but it's interesting - as a mental exercise - that the same logic doesn't make the same people conclude that if God is incomprehensibly good and righteous, that He would - by contrast - be mortified moment by moment with how humanity acts. If He is so great, that humanity should be ignored; why is He not so good, that we should be abhorred? Why would even our charity - as slightly impure as it might be - not insult Him, given that in His light no shadow can abound? Why should He be more forgiving than we could ever imagine, and not more enthusiastic about judging every offense than we could ever imagine? What accounts for your stacking the deck more to our benefit, than to our contempt?",

It is an interesting mix of self-awareness and self-delusion. This is absuive. \"Love me or suffer\" is the textbook definition of an absuive relationship.\n\n>God is too incomprehensible and great to care and love such small and insignificant beings like humans\n\nIf God exists I doubt he cares about 10^-82nd percent of the universe (by volume).\n\n>that the same logic doesn't make the same people conclude that if God is incomprehensibly good and righteous, that He would - by contrast - be mortified moment by moment with how humanity acts.\n\nHow is that the same logic? I don't see the analogy.\n\n>why is He not so good, that we should be abhorred?\n\nBecause goodness never results in abhorrence. Techinally speaking goodness never results in any emotion. An action is good if it decreases unnecessary suffering or harm or both, the emotions of people involed are only relavent if they result in the reduction of harm. The fact I find x action ahorrent is a result of emapthy and rage, not morality.\n\n>Why would even our charity - as slightly impure as it might be - not insult Him, given that in His light no shadow can abound?\n\nThat's a warped understanding of morality.\n\n>What accounts for your stacking the deck more to our benefit, than to our contempt?\n\nDo you not hear yourself proving the OPs point for him? Or do you not care. Again, this is textbook absuive relationship stuff. But to actually answer your question. An action is moral if it decreases unnecessary suffering or harm or both, and as such a moral God would stack the deck in our favor because it would decreade unnecessary suffering or harm or both. It's not complicated.",

He simply doesn't care and as such let's stop pretending he is omnibenevolent. So let's move on to other gods as the christian is done after admitting that.",

He could make sin not a thing, he could make all sinners explode into dust at the moment they try to sin, etc etc. He's an uncaring being at best and an evil one at worst. Indeed he has punished and entire species and planet apparently due to the actions of two beings, two beings he created which were tempted by a third and very evil being he also created btw\n\nAnd please don't try to counter that with any free will argument, as that is incompatible with the Abrahimic god",
