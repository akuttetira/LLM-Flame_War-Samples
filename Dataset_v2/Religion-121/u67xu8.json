    "Post_Title": "Christians should be more honest that the trinity makes no logical sense",
    "post_text ": "I've been trying for years to understand the concept of the Christian trinity, and the more I read, the more it seems that it is just a contrivance used to try and fit the events in the Bible to the idea that Jesus was God. \n\nDue to various passages in the Bible, Christians require that (1) the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct persons, (2) each person is fully God, (3) there is only one God. The problem is that these three requirements can only be maintained by tying yourself up in logical knots, and by trying to make 1+1+1=1. Due to this logical inconsistency, the concept of the trinity therefore has to be sold to people in misty, vague, poetic language that doesn't ultimately make rational sense. Sure, we can draw diagrams of what we think it means, but as soon as we apply any level of scrutiny to it, it unravels. Contradiction is central to the whole concept.\n\nThis all came about because the Bible, by stating that there is one God but three different persons that are each fully god, is not internally consistent. Trinitarian theology has spent hundreds of years wrestling with that inherent inconsistency, and has ended up with \"just accept this non-sensical idea even if it makes no sense\". \n\nIs it therefore time to admit that the trinity doesn't make any logical sense, rather than suggesting that it is people's lack of understanding of it that is at fault? Perhaps we could even admit that the Bible has this glaring inconsistency that no amount of philosophical pondering will ever resolve? Perhaps, even, logical consistency is not required and Trinitarian Christians can happily accept that?\n\nEdit: This has been a really useful learning experience for me - mainly I've learnt that there is a lot of confusion about what is the official (i.e. Catholic/orthodox/protestant) doctrine of the trinity. There's a lot of heretical modalism and partialism going on out there! Obviously anyone can believe whatever they like, but the original point of my post still stands.",

The concept of the trinity has been defined by the authorities of the faith in a clear, precise philosophical language. There is nothing \"misty\" or \"vague\" about it, except maybe if you ask the layman who isn't familiar with the actual teaching. Just because you can't draw a 100\\_% accurate diagram of the transcendend Godhead doesn't mean it's illogical",

All the higher truths about God (who is the Principle of being and as such above being) transcend the principle of non-contradiction (he is omnipresent and nowhere, he is the being of all things while being nothing at all, etc.pp.). That doesn't make it illogical tho, since this transcending does itself follow a strict logic (i.e., *because* he is everywhere he is at no particular place and precisely because he is the being of all beings he is no being himself etc.). Contradiction pertains to creation, i.e., duality, but God is the place where opposites meet.\n\nHowever, the analogy of human and divine personality (even though it is quite true) is probably ill-advised because it too easily into the \"greek\" error of thinking of the hypostases as a kind of \"individual substance\", a \"center of consciousness\", or other such non-sense. There is only one Center, the divine Essence eternally deploying itself in the threefold relation of paternity, filiation and spiration.",

The Trinity doesn’t just “share the same nature”, they’re literally the same being. Last I checked, I am not you, because such a statement is a logical contradiction. If you’re happy with that conclusion, great!\n\n>\tthe principle of non-contradiction only applies to ontological realities\n\nThat’s just a fancy way of saying that logic doesn’t apply to gods. No justification backs up this claim, you simply assert it. Again, I’m fine with this, as it blows up every ontological argument for the existence of a god.\n\n>\tdivine personality … hypostases as a kind of “individual substance” … the divine Essence … paternity, filiation and spiration.\n\nI feel like I just walked into a psych ward and read ramblings on the wall covered in fecal matter.
