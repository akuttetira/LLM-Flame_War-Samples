    "post_text ": "In the Qur’an, Surah 68 verse 4, Allah states that “…[Muhammad] is a man of the highest moral excellence.” \n\nHowever, Muhammad married a six-year-old and had sex with her when she was just nine. \n\nAs someone who believes that having sex with children is wrong, it is laughable to think that such a blatant pedophile is asserted by muslims as to be *the standard* of a good Muslim and indeed of a good man. \n\nEven if culturally it might have been less outrageous then, I still believe that a nine year old is not nearly mature enough to consent to sexual intercourse, especially not with a man nearly fifty years her senior.",
