We went to Medina and stayed at the home of Bani-al-Harith bin Khazraj. Then I got ill and my hair fell down. Later on my hair grew (again) and my mother, Um Ruman, came to me while I was playing in a swing with some of my girl friends. She called me, and I went to her, not knowing what she wanted to do to me. She caught me by the hand and made me stand at the door of the house. I was breathless then, and when my breathing became all right, she took some water and rubbed my face and head with it. Then she took me into the house. There in the house I saw some Ansari women who said, \"Best wishes and Allah's Blessing and a good luck.\" Then she entrusted me to them and they prepared me (for the marriage). Unexpectedly Allah's Apostle came to me in the forenoon and my mother handed me over to him, and at that time I was a girl of nine years of age. (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Volume 5, Book 58, Number 234)\n\n\nNarrated Hisham's father:\nKhadija died three years before the Prophet departed to Medina. He stayed there for two years or so and then he married 'Aisha when she was a girl of six years of age, and he consumed that marriage when she was nine years old. (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Volume 5, Book 58, Number 236)\n\nA'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported that Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) married her when she was seven years old, and he was taken to his house as a bride when she was nine, and her dolls were with her; and when he (the Holy Prophet) died she was eighteen years old. (Sahih Muslim, Book 008, Number 3311)\n\n\nAisha said: The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) married me when I was seven years old. The narrator Sulaiman said: Or six years. He had intercourse with me when I was nine years old. (Sunan Abu Dawud, Number 2116)\n\nNarrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:\nThe Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) married me when I was seven or six. When we came to Medina, some women came. According to Bishr's version: Umm Ruman came to me when I was swinging. They took me, made me prepared and decorated me. I was then brought to the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him), and he took up cohabitation with me when I was nine. She halted me at the door, and I burst into laughter. (Sunan Abu Dawud, Book 41, Number 4915)\n\nNarrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:\nThe Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) used to kiss her and suck her tongue when he was fasting. (Sunan Abu Dawud, Book 13, Number 2380)\n\n\nSome muslims argue that aisha  participated in battle of badr happened in 624AD so this is all false because you have to be adult to participate in war.but back then wars were fought by children young as 10-16 years of age.\nAisha being favourite of Muhammed . it isnt uncommon for her to be in assistance camp of mohammed\n\nWAS IT NORMAL BACK THEN?\n\nI do not know. But the fact that Aishah was exempted from rulings that effected the whole adult population, means that the society back then didn’t think that a little girl of 6 to 9 years old had the proper mental capacities that adults had!\n\nNo matter how you spin it, Muhammad had sex with a minor, even to those standards back then!\n\n\n\nEDIT:\nMany muslims claim Aisha was 19 as Asma is considered to be  10 years older than Aisha citing the sources of Ibn kathir and ibn asakir who lived 700 years and 500 years after Muhammeds death\n\nIbn kathir born in 1373AD almost 700 years after mohammed's death\nIbn asakir was born in  1106AD almost 500 years after mohammeds death",

            "Reply_Text": "Of all the accusations laid against prophet Muhammad, the most favorite one of his critics is the accusation of pedophilia. They say that Prophet Muhammad was a pedophile based on the myth that he married a 9 years old girl Aisha, when he himself was about 50 years old. This accusation is made to de-legitimize the authority of prophet Muhammad as a moral and spiritual guide. It also frustrates the hell out of Muslims (I ll explain later, why). So, Islam-bashers and Muslim-haters have a field day when they play the pedophilia card in a debate.\n\nWhat is the source of their accusation? The famous 9th century Islamic scholar Muhammad ibn Isma'il al-Bukhari, commonly referred to as Imam al-Bukhari mentioned a Hadith in his Sahih collection that Aisha narrated that the Prophet married her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old. (Sahih Bukhari, volume 5, book 58, number 234)\n\nLet’s get straight to the point. I will explain why it is highly unlikely that Prophet married Aisha when she was just a child. Firstly, the Quran indicates that there is an “age of marriage” (4:6) when both consenting partners are mature physically and mentally to enter into the legal contract of marriage (4:21). So it highly unlikely that Prophet Muhammad would go against the standards set in the Quran (irrespective of whether Quran is truely a word of God or a product of Prophet’s own mind).\n\nBesides this, there is another reason why Aisha definitely could not be 9 years old at the time of her marriage. This reason is called Mathematics. To explain it better, I would like to quote A Faizur Rahman (Hindustan Times, May 09, 2009),\n\n“..the age of Hazrat Aisha can be easily calculated from the age of her elder sister Hazrat Asma who was 10 years older than Hazrat Aisha. Waliuddin Muhammad Abdullah Al-Khateeb al Amri Tabrizi the famous author of Mishkath, in his biography of narrators (Asma ur Rijal), writes that Hazrat Asma died in the year 73 Hijri at the age of 100, ten or twelve days after the martyrdom of her son Abdullah Ibn Zubair. It is common knowledge that the Islamic calendar starts from the year of the Hijrah or the Prophet’s migration from Mecca to Medina.\n\nTherefore, by deducting 73, the year of Hazrat Asma’s death, from 100, her age at that time, we can easily conclude that she was 27 years old during Hijra.\n\nThis puts the age of Hazrat Aisha at 17 during the same period. As all biographers of the Prophet agree that he consummated his marriage with Hazrat Aisha in the year 2 Hijri, it can be conclusively said that she was 19 at that time and not 9 as alleged in the aforementioned hadiths.”\n\nLooks like we don’t need a PhD to establish the age of Aisha. It’s just basic mathematics. Then what is all the fuss about? Why can’t Muslims shut up the critics by simply showing them a fourth-standard calculation?",

People like me believe that the hadith is fabricated/ distorted.\nThere are too many things wrong with it, plus, when the hadith were compiled and classified, there really wasn't enough resources to verify their authenticity.\nHere's some more evidence I've found:\n\nThe issue is not just about Aisha’s age. It’s a bigger issue about the sacrocanctity of “Sahih” Hadiths. Unfortunately, many of the conservative and literalist Muslim theologians have elevated the status of Imam Bukhari's book to a level second to Qur'an in authority. It is because they consider all Hadiths in Bukhari's collection to be Sahih or “Authentic”. This is the reason why most conservative Muslim clerics do not like to question the authenticity of the hadith of Aisha’s age, especially in an open forum. So they just beat around the bush instead, making things worse.\n\nSome of you might ask me: Besides the “math ain't mathing\" logic, is there any other objective reason to invalidate and reject this particular hadith about Aisha's marital age?\n\nThe answer to this question is: Yes! This particular hadith has another serious issue besides the math. The problem starts with the fact that there is one narrator Hishām ibn ʿUrwa who narrated this hadith which says that Aisha was betrothed at 6 years old and married at 9. He narrated it when he was in Iraq, between the years 754 and 765 CE. Not only would this put the circulation of this report almost a century and a half after the events it purports to describe, but it would also mean that Hishām narrated it in the altogether different environment of Iraq, almost 1,000 miles away from the Arabian city of Medina (where the marriage would have taken place). Due to this obvious reason, the hadith of Aisha’s marital age becomes a totally unreliable source of information about Aisha's marriage to the Prophet. It is also very clear that, most likely Hishām ibn Urwa fabricated or invented this false Hadith.\n\nWhy would anyone fabricate or invent a false hadith, you may ask? We must bear in mind that the post-Prophetic period in Islamic history was full of political, sectarian and dynastic rivalries. Many Hadiths were fabricated during this period and falsely attributed to Prophet Muhammad in order to justify certain ideological, political and dynastic agendas and interests. From this perspective, historian Dr. Joshua Little of University of Oxford has recently published a detailed in-depth research on the Hadith of Aisha's marital age. I would strongly recommend reading it for further research on this topic.\n\nOne can find several academic scholars and historians of past and present who have shared the doubts on the hadith of Aisha’s marital age. Unfortunately, most traditional/conservative Muslims do not understand that there is nothing embarrassing or “blasphemous” about doubting hadiths and even rejecting hadiths. Some of the mainstream classical Islamic scholars in Islamic history have rejected many hadiths if the Isnad (chain of transmission) and Matn (content) of such hadiths didn't meet their criteria of evaluation. Additionally, mere establishment of a sound chain of transmission does not automatically prove the authenticity and historical accuracy of a Hadith. A Hadith can be considered inauthentic (or at least its meaning is not taken literally), if its matn or content goes against empirical evidence, sound Reason and overall spirit of the Qur'an. This is not some modernist, liberal and secular criteria of hadith evaluation. This has been the approach of many Muslim scholars and intellectuals of the past including Ibn al Jawzi, Khatib al Baghdadi and Ibn Rushd.\n\nIn the modern times, there have been some prominent scholars such as Muhammad Tawfiq Sidqi, Syed Ahmad Khan, Muhammad Iqbal, Edip Yüksel, etc., who have engaged in Matn criticism of Hadiths of the mainstream orthodox canon, in the light of scientific developments and changed socio-economic circumstances. They have encouraged a re-interpretation and even outright rejection of some or most of the Hadiths (no matter how sound are their chains of transmission). No learned scholar in his right mind can consider Hadith books as “divine scriptures”, especially considering the contentious and troubled history of transmission, forgery and misuse of many Hadith narrations after the death of prophet Muhammad. It was only after at least two centuries of Prophet’s death, that compilations of Hadiths in form of written books were produced. No matter how much effort was taken by sincere Hadith scholars and compilers, it was humanly impossible to remove every fake narration from their compilation. This is why it is not surprising to often find some illogical, un-Quranic and factually incorrect narrations and reports even in the most trusted books of Hadiths.\n\nLet us now take this discussion in another direction. We all know that the bigots and haters who bring up this issue in debates again and again, are not interested in knowing the facts about Aisha and her age at the time of marriage, but their agenda is to desperately “prove” that Prophet Muhammad was a lust-driven, sinful and unethical person. This idea goes back to the time of Crusades. According to the academic Kecia Ali: \"Accusations of lust and sensuality were a regular feature of medieval attacks on the prophet’s character and, by extension, on the authenticity of Islam.\"\n\nI find the explanation of Myriam Francois-Cerrah most apt on this issue. So I quote her directly from her article in The Guardian (17th Sep 2012).\n\n“Since the early Christians heralded Christ as a model of celibate virtue, Muhammad – who had married several times – was deemed to be driven by sinful lust. This portrayal ignored the fact that before his marriage to Aisha, Muhammad had been married to Khadija, a powerful businesswoman 15 years his senior, for 25 years. When she died, he was devastated and friends encouraged him to remarry. A female acquaintance suggested Aisha, a bright and vivacious character.”\n\nShe further writes,\n\n“What the records are clear on is that Muhammad and Aisha had a loving and egalitarian relationship, which set the standard for reciprocity, tenderness and respect enjoined by the Qur’an. Insights into their relationship, such as the fact they liked to drink out of the same cup or race one another, are indicative of a deep connection which belies any misrepresentation of their relationship.\n\nTo paint Aisha as a victim is completely at odds with her persona. She was certainly no wallflower. During a controversial battle in Muslim history, she emerged riding a camel to lead the troops. She was known for her assertive temperament and mischievous sense of humour – with Muhammad sometimes bearing the brunt of the jokes. During his lifetime, he established her authority by telling Muslims to consult her in his absence; after his death, she went to be become one of the most prolific and distinguished scholars of her time.”\n\nMyriam concludes perfectly as,\n\n“Those who manipulate her story to justify the abuse of young girls, and those who manipulate it in order to depict Islam as a religion that legitimises such abuse have more in common than they think. Both demonstrate a disregard for what we know about the times in which Muhammad lived, and for the affirmation of autonomy which her story illustrates.”",

The problem starts with the fact that there is one narrator Hishām ibn ʿUrwa who narrated this hadith which says that Aisha was betrothed at 6 years old and married at 9.\n\nAlso incorrect. Not only is it more than just one hadith. Not only is it in more than just Bukhari. It is narrated through more than just Hisham bin Urwa.\n\n\" Al-Zuhri also reports it from \\`Urwa, from \\`A’isha; so does \\`Abd Allah ibn Dhakwan – both major Madanis. So is the Tabi\\`i Yahya al-Lakhmi who reports it from her in the Musnad and in Ibn Sa\\`d's Tabaqat. So is Abu Ishaq Sa\\`d ibn Ibrahim who reports it from Imam al-Qasim ibn Muhammad – one of the Seven Imams of Madina – from \\`A’isha.\"\n\n\"In addition to the above four Madinese Tabi\\`in narrators, Sufyan ibn \\`Uyayna – from Khurasan – and \\`Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Yahya – from Tabarayya in Palestine – both report it. Nor was this hadith reported only by \\`Urwa but also by \\`Abd al-Malik ibn \\`Umayr, al-Aswad, Ibn Abi Mulayka, Abu Salama ibn \\`Abd al-Rahman ibn \\`Awf, Yahya ibn \\`Abd al-Rahman ibn Hatib, Abu \\`Ubayda (\\`Amir ibn \\`Abd Allah ibn Mas\\`ud) and others of the Tabi\\`i Imams directly from \\`A’isha.\n\nThis makes the report mass-transmitted (mutawatir) from \\`A’isha by over eleven authorities among the Tabi\\`in, not counting the other major Companions that reported the same, such as Ibn Mas\\`ud nor other major Successors that reported it from other than \\`A’isha, such as Qatada!\"\n\nMore on ‘Ā’isha’s Age at the Time of Her Marriage\n\nA Dialogue Between “The Learner” and Shaykh Gibril F.

But keep in mind that Islam warns us against blindly following any humans, so this is just as sinful in the religion as it is in daily life.\nFriendly reminder, there weren't any Muslims on Epstein's island. I agree that Muslims have become very brainwashed but that doesn't mean the religion is inherently bad.",
