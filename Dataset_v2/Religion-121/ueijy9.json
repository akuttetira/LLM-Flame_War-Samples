    "post_text ": "The child, being too young to have properly developed its prefrontal cortex, could not possibly be in a position to choose a religion, let alone question the validity of it. I surmise that children must automatically go to heaven.\n\nIt then follows than the most selfless and generous act a person could ever commit is to kill their own child, **guaranteeing** an entrance to heaven. Because this life is nothing in comparison to ETERNITY in paradise. **Eternity**. Stay on that word for a while and really ponder it. It is no small thing. In fact, there is nothing larger.\n\nAnd how could god possibly reject entry to the pearly gates to those who would selflessly sacrifice a spot in paradise and instead endure an **ETERNITY** of torment and agony for another person?\n\nDoesn't seem omnibenevolent to me.\n\nAnd that's not the entire issue here. Another problem is that some people are simply granted a ticket to paradise by default. Born deaf, blind and mute? Well, surely you must be granted access to heaven. You had no say in the matter. That seems very unfair to the rest of us who grew up in atheist families. The cards are stacked against us.\n\nYou see, when you talk about **eternity** \\- things get curious really quickly. In fact, you need to stretch the boundaries of logic so hard that eventually you can only arrive at one conclusion: the idea that god (as demonstrated in the abrahamic religions) exists is so improbable that you are simply wasting your time. Much like you are wasting your time buying lottery tickets hoping to win a billion dollars.\n\nAnd there you go. I have just justified to you, using religion and paradise, the murder of your own child.",

What if you’re tortured the same amount but you can save two kids?  Three? How many kids would you have to save before it’s ok for you?\n\nBecause if you would do that, that’s not fundamentally different from savings a child from hell by sending them to heaven, and going to hell yourself instead.",
