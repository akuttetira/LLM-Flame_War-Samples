    "post_text ": "Pretend your mother or your child goes to Hell, and you don’t know why. You thought they were going to Heaven. And when you go to Heaven, you are aware of the fact that someone you love in burning or being tortured in Hell. How are you truly in ‘peaceful and perfect’ Heaven with this knowledge? That sounds like Hell anyway; knowing someone you love is in pain for eternity and there’s nothing you can do about it. \n\nOn the flip side, what if you don’t know this. What if your memory has been wiped of this knowledge. Are you even yourself? One of the main aspects that makes up an individual is their memories and their conscience. If your memory is gone, who are you? Because then, you aren’t in Heaven at all.",

By this time they had come to the town, and the passers-by began to jeer and point at them. The Man stopped and asked what they were scoffing at.

The amount of people who believe in it has nothing to do with its truth. Even if everyone in the world believed it, you could still ask how to know who's right.\n\nWe can tell what is true doctrine, by how much it conforms to the one true Eastern Orthodox Church.
