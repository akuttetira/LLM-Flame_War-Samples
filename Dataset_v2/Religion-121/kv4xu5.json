It's amazing how they can control the opinion of the supreme beings in charge of the universe.\n\nThis observation shows that theists will do whatever they wish to do, just like atheists. We all have a sense of right and wrong. Atheists just realize that they are the ones who determine what it is, while theists assume it comes from an immaterial spirit. Either way, good people are good and bad people are bad, regardless of what our theistic position may be.",

No surprise there.)\n\nDid you also conflate that 'presence' with having a conscience? I notice many religious people don't quite get how others (atheists, other religions) aren't doing all sorts of heinous shit while not following the correct religion. In fairness to the rest of the world, that phenomenon seems primarily a US 'christian' thing and it deeply disturbs me.",

Abraham *did not want* to kill Isaac, down to his very core, but God demanded it, to compel obedience, and then stayed Abraham's hand before he could follow through, demonstrating that through loyalty to him, one will be rewarded so long as one obeys.\n\nNow of course I don't believe in the veracity of the mythos, but it is an interesting contrast to how so many people who consider themselves \"religious\" today transparently use god to justify anything they already want to do.",

I.e. your social group is religious but you and they are also subject to the greater pressure of society that says hey lgbtq are just fine.\n\nSo you have to walk the line with both social groups that you are dependent on.\n\nNow if a person occupying a world position starts empowering the voices of those who still want to discriminate against people (cause, hey, other people I don't know are scary y'all!) Then that basically reduces the greater social pressure to be publicly 'ok with the gay\"(or any other 'other' you and your social group don't like/trust etc.)\n\nTribalism and xenophobia has deep roots in social biological evolution and it takes efforts to overcome the negative repercussions in a more global and diverse world.\n\nI'm simplifying here. There are decent people trapped in the dogma of their social groups and expressing a different opinion than your social group is very risky to your well being, regardless.\n\nBreaking away from your friends family and risking work etc takes a lot more than people probably realize.\n\nThis is obviously why few politicians come out as secular.",

And on Wednesday. My mother and father were best friends with the pastor and his wife. At 14 I had been going to this church my whole life. All of a sudden they claimed my mom stole money. (She did the accounting). It threw my parents into a loop. Forgiveness was a major thing in that church. And their best friends of 20 years all of a sudden cast them out.\nMy parents hated lgbtq relationships, they hated witchcraft and so on. I wasn't allowed Halloween as a kid. These ideals didn't leave an impression on my siblings and I. Because we didn't get why any of this stuff was bad. It's been 14 years since they were kicked out of the church. And they now accept anyone of any sexuality. They celebrate Halloween. Heck mom even says she likes Harry Potter, which we burned out back behind the church. And now we can enjoy an adult beverage together. She still has her faith. But honestly I think she's lost alot of her fanatical zeal. She sees that she hasn't been punished for being more open and accepting. She knows she's still a good human.\nWho would have known what getting booted from her church would have done for her?",

The moment I realized I didn't have a good reason to keep believing in God, I pretty much did a 180 on my stance on all those issues where my religion was my only reason for having conservative views on them.\n\nI imagine for most people it's just an excuse. But I can't be the only one who had conservative views strictly because of the religion I was in. I also imagine that, like myself, most such people don't end up staying in that religious environment for very long.",

Essentially, I had no personal objections to gay rights, but my religion said it was bad so I felt I had to object on moral, if not legal, grounds. That phase lasted roughly four years before I apostatized.\n\n>\"Well, I don't see any problem with gays nor with women's equality, but God doesn't like it, so I have to be against them\"?\n\nI never said that verbatim, but I would honestly say that is an accurate description of my beliefs at the time.",

When asked about their own opinion a different part lit up. When asked about their deity's opinion the same part of the brain that deals with personal opinion lit up. When given a refutation of their opinion from the holy text they were skeptical and refused to consider changing their mind because \"God speaks to them\" and tells them which parts to believe.\n\nBasically, while theists think of their god as a separate entity, their deity's opinions always happen to match theirs. This is yet another danger of religion as it trains people to be unwilling to change their mind to reflect reality. Now I'm just waiting for a study that looks at the same parts of the brain regarding imaginary friends.",
