    "Post_Title": "Muhammad's marriage to Aisha (RA) is a valid argument against islam.",
    "post_text ": "Before beginning I'll show some accepted hadiths that show that Aisha was a child when married to Muhammed\n\n-- Aisha was 9 years old when the prophet consummated the marriage.\n\nhttps://sunnah.com/bukhari:5134\n\nNarrated Aisha,\nthat the Prophet (ﷺ) married her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old. Hisham said: I have been informed that `Aisha remained with the Prophet (ﷺ) for nine years (i.e. till his death).\n\nhttps://sunnah.com/muslim:1422c\n\nA'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) married her when she was seven years old, and he was taken to his house as a bride when she was nine, and her dolls were with her; and when he (the Holy Prophet) died she was eighteen years old.\n\nThis was narrated by Aisha herself and clearly states her age and when he consummated the marriage. These hadiths are also Sahih with the proper chain of narrators and is accepted by almost all scholars. \n\n\n--The arguments against the immorality of this marriage and consummation.\n\n-You are using modern day standard to judge this marriage/At the time of prophet this was perfectly normal\n\nThis argument becomes completely invalid when you remember Muhammad is supposed to be the perfect person, someone that is to be only loved lesser than god himself. He is supposed to be the perfect role model for all muslims and should be judged by modern day standards. He is a messenger of god himself, even if he didn't know better Allah should have considering Allah is supposed to be an all-knowing god. i.e the best human to have ever lived and who all people are supposed to follow the image of can and should be absolutely judged by modern standards.\n\n- She hit puberty before he had sex with her\n\nHer hitting puberty doesn't suddenly make her a mentally mature person, she was still a 9 years old. Hitting puberty != mental maturity. \n\n- Aisha and her father approved of the marriage \n\nThis means absolutely nothing. Because 1. Children cannot consent 2. The role model of all Muslims and the \"best human to have ever lived\" still had sex with a nine year old.\n\n\n-- Conclusion\n\n~~I don't believe that Muhammad was a pedophile~~ I was wrong about this belief... I do think Muhammad was a pedophile however please remember that this is still presentism, however his marriage to Aisha shows that marrying a child is okay according to God himself as Muhammad is supposed to be a messenger to god himself and the belief that a righteous god is okay with child marriage is absurd. Muhammad in no way is the best person to have ever lived and was just a man of his time.\n\nEdit: Muhammad having sex with a child isn't really an argument against Islam (although it was disgusting and morally bankrupt) the belief that Muhammad is supposed to be a role model for all people while still having committed this deplorable act however I would argue does make it an argument against Islam.",

            "Reply_Text": "This argument appeared around 120 years ago. Did nobody noticed? They knew. The difference is that around 120 years ago there was a moved to make age more strict and attach laws to that particular age. So it's not a coincidence and part of why it's fallacious argument.\n\nAisha r.a. herself stated that she was a women at 9. It doesn't get more direct than that. Either you accept it or some form of dictating to her how she didn't know what she was talking about.\n\nAt the time there was no such thing as teenage, it was child or adult. Hence this concept that 'a 9 year old is a child in today's society and therefore she must have been a child then at that age back then' is ahistorical no matter how much one dislikes it. Any kind of accurate usage of the term age as it is applied to back then would have to recognizes that it had a more fluid application across human history.\n\nIf presentism is okay then subjective transitory morals are okay as a standard of truth. If someone actually thinks that then they have an absolutely horrible standard of truth. If truth can be both right and wrong then truth can be contradictory and thus there is no standard of truth as there is nothing to differentiate one being true and the other false.\n\nAisha like all the wives of the Prophet had a choice, specifically given by Allah in the Quran, to leave if she so wished. Same goes for all arranged marriages, she still has the choice to refuse. So any claim that she had to stay etc are kind of silly. Same for claims of trauma by taking some hadiths and twisting them. It's a less than intellectual approach to toss around terms that don't even apply.\n\nSomeone said it's the colloquial usage of pedophilia, yeah it is, because none of the signs/indicators of trauma from pedophilia are present in Aisha's narrations/hadiths. Rather we find the opposite, a loving and healthy relationship that shouldn't exist if the claim was actually true. Remember they were together about a decade and then she lived on narrating hadiths for several decades later. She was someone that excelled in all aspects of life and would become one of the greatest scholars and muhaddithan in Islam.\n\nThe actual standard of marriageable age in Islam is not tied to age and since the argument is relying on this claim of pedophilia to then claim he is a bad role model that humans in general can't accept I addressed the pedophilia claim.\n\nI don't get your edit, it makes it seem like your judgement of him is supposed to be some kind of standard of truth that comes to a truth??? Also don't get the \"however please remember that this is still presentism\", as presentism is a fallacy.",

And you would just dismiss them anyway, like you do with Zaynab's case (a very popular old criticism). The best one can say is that older Christian polemics and such were more revolted by Zaynab's case, given it's plausible they knew about Aisha.\n\n>She herself said that a girl becomes a women at 9 years old, not a minor/girl i.e. puberty had been reached\n\nThere's zero evidence she had reached puberty (see Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani's comment on Bukhari 6130), AND a girl doesn't become mature after bleeding for the first time.\n\n>they would arrange a marriage, but not live with each other until both had reached puberty.\n\nCorrect. But not people with 45 years of difference, and again, not the case above, and not the case required by Islam (Sura 65:4 implies pre-pubescent consummation, don't know how many million of times more I will have to say this...)\n\n>As for arranged marriages, yes if the girl is silent then that is taken as enough approval.

Find someone pointing to Muhammad's marriage to Aisha and saying she was a minor therefore it was wrong as to show my claim about the historicity of the argument and it's timing is false. Otherwise it is as I stated, it's a recent argument based around presentism where people try to impose their subjective definitions and morals inaccurately/ahistorically.\n\n> There's zero evidence she had reached puberty (see Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani's comment on Bukhari 6130), AND a girl doesn't become mature after bleeding for the first time.\n\nFirst of all that's one commentary on one hadith about Aisha when she lived with her parents, not about when she had moved out. It can easily be placed before the other hadiths stating that she had in fact reached the age of puberty.\n\nAisha's own statements is literally the best evidence one can get about Aisha and whether she had reached puberty.\n\nNarrated Aisha: I had seen my parents following Islam since I attained the age of puberty. Not a day passed but the Prophet visited us, both in the mornings and evenings.” - Sahih al-Bukhari volume 1, Book 8, Hadith 465\n\nNarrated Aisha: \"When the girl becomes 9 years old, she has become a woman.\" - Jami at-Tirmidhi 1109\n\nSo zero evidence is completely false, actually the most direct and best evidence is right there. Rather than use someone's commentary , that doesn't even contradict, we have her own words clearly stating she had reached the age of puberty and that she was a woman. Now match that with Bukhari 6130 that you yourself brought forth. She had already reached the age of puberty during that time when Muhammad would visit Abu Bakr i.e. before moving in with him.\n\nAlso nobody said the standard for becoming a women/mature is she bleed once. That is not the standard in Islam nor does it mean sexual intercourse is now permitted. Both mental and physical attributes are needed so even one being present doesn't conclude the other is. In such a case that one isn't ready the marriage is consummated by seclusion, not sexual intercourse.\n\n> False. The Hanafis take her opinion into account, the Hanbalis at least do not, even if she refuses.\n\nThat's a difference in opinion, not binding, and besides the point as Hanafi nor Hanbali schools existed then. Both her and her parents all were in agreement. As stated before she could refuse after the fact by command of Allah.\n\nEdit: Just to make it clear there is prophetic hadith saying a girl can refuse without any qualitifier that it doesn't apply if she is a virgin or whatever. Book of Marriage, Tirmidhi Chapter: What Has Been Related About Coercing A Female Orphan To Marry\n\nThe Messenger of Allah said: \"An orphan is to be consulted about herself, then if she is silent that is her permission, and if she refuses, then do not authorize it (the marriage) for her\" (meaning: when she attains the age of puberty and refuses it.)\n\nhttps://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:1109\n\nStop reading known hate sites and pretending as if they inform you about Islam u/69PepperoniPickles69.",

Why? Because that hadith does not have the word puberty or anything implying it in it. Translation by Dr. Bewley: \"It is related that 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, said, \"I have no **recollection** of my parents doing anything but following the deen of Islam. (...)\". The word there is \"'aql\" which in context simply means she could never remember a time when her parents were not Muslim. Furthermore, we know that's true, because Abu Bakr was already a Muslim far before she reached puberty (even if we grant it was at 9). The whole argument is incoherent with your own sources. Still not convinced? Ok, I'll grant this was a genuine translation mistake. Now I'll demonstrate yet again how disgustingly dishonest some of your translators and sources are. Here's the way Sunnah.com has another one: Sunan Abu Dawud 4933 - \"(...) She halted me at the door, and I burst into laughter.\nAbu Dawud said: That is to say: I menstruated' (...)\" Now Muhsin-Khan's translation of the same \"She\nmade me stand at the door and I started to breathe deeply.\" (source: http://kalamullah.com/Books/Hadith/Sunan%20Abu%20Dawud%20Vol.%205%20-%204351-5274.pdf) Where did they get the idea the Arabic there ANYWHERE is refering to menstruation? It doesn't. The Arabic says \"Aisha went 'Heeh..heeh' - Abu Dawud explained, that means she breathed heavily\". It's all lies piled on lies piled on lies. The end.",
