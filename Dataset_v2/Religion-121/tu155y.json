    "post_text ": "This is for Christians that believe in the existence of Satan. If I assess God's goodness and intelligence based purely on their commandments, actions, and communication methods, then the God of the Bible seems quite cruel, petty, limited, and careless. I'd have an easier time believing the Bible was written by Satan in disguise than an actual all-loving and all-wise God. As far as why the real God would allow Satan to write the Bible and fool people, it could be because the real God wants people to figure things out for themselves and the Bible is just a trap/test. Humans get zero hand holding when it comes to science and every other area of life, but apparently spirituality is the one area where hand holding is allowed. These are the reasons I think the God of the Bible is more likely to be Satan in disguise than the real God:\n\n* Jesus contradicted the God of the Old Testament and was trying to point out that the God of the Old Testament was immoral and not who he claims:\n\n   > Example 1:\n\n   > The people spoke against God and against Moses, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and we detest this miserable food.” Then the Lord sent poisonous serpents among the people, and they bit the people, so that many Israelites died. Numbers 21:5-6\n\n   >  Is there anyone among you who, if your child asks for bread, will give a stone? Or if the child asks for a fish, will give a snake? Matthew 7:9-10\n\n   >  Example 2:\n\n   > Moses said, “Thus says the Lord: About midnight I will go out through Egypt. Every firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne to the firstborn of the female slave who is behind the handmill, and all the firstborn of the livestock. Then there will be a loud cry throughout the whole land of Egypt, such as has never been or will ever be again. But not a dog shall growl at any of the Israelites—not at people, not at animals—so that you may know that the Lord makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel. Exodus 11:4-7\n\n   > But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be children of your Father in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous. Matthew 5:44-45\n\n* Jesus said no one knew the Father, aka the real God, except him. But the Hebrews 2000 years ago were well aware of \"Yahweh\" and even had commandments that came directly out of his mouth. Perhaps Jesus was saying only he knew the Father, because he came from the real Yahweh, and the real Yahweh had not yet revealed himself up until then. Thus the Yahweh everyone had known up to that point was an imposter.\n\n  > All things have been handed over to me by my Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him. Matthew 11:27\n\n* If the God of the Bible is Satan in disguise, then it explains all the following:\n\n  * Hell, eternal torment, slavery, massacres, sexism, nonsensical means to salvation, etc. Satan loves double think, so Satan presents an image of God that is cruel, petty, immoral, irrational, etc. while getting people to believe that this is the image of an all-loving and all-wise God.\n\n  * The Bible and Christian doctrine is full of fear and guilt because Satan feeds off these negative emotions. This is why Satan had included hell, emphasized sin, set unreasonable standards, turned biological drives into a factory of guilt, etc.\n\n  * God's apparent demand for worship. Only Satan would have an ego that needs to be stoked through worship.\n\n  * The God of the Bible is very authoritarian. This is because Satan despises freedom and views humans as characters in The Sims that he can direct this way and that way.\n  \n  * Satan loves ignorance. This is why the Bible has bad science, heavily miskewed conceptions of the afterlife, heavily miskewed conceptions of God, laws and commandments that would be considered immoral by any sufficiently advanced society, etc.\n\n* \"Yahweh\"/Satan tells the Israelites that if cities surrender to them in peace, to capture everyone and turn them into slaves, and if they refuse, then to kill all the men and \"plunder\" all the women/children. Only Satan would command such horrible acts. Some of those women the Israelites captured definitely birthed children and they did not consent to doing so.\n\n > 10 When you march up to attack a city, make its people an offer of peace. 11 If they accept and open their gates, all the people in it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you. 12 If they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle, lay siege to that city. 13 When the Lord your God delivers it into your hand, put to the sword all the men in it. 14 As for the women, the children, the livestock and everything else in the city, you may take these as plunder for yourselves. And you may use the plunder the Lord your God gives you from your enemies. 15 This is how you are to treat all the cities that are at a distance from you and do not belong to the nations nearby. Deuteronomy 20:10-15\n\n* \"Yahweh\"/Satan can't do anything truly good, so that's why freeing the Israelites had to accompany the killing of all the Egyptian firstborns.\n\n* \"Yahweh\"/Satan couldn't simply teleport the Israelites out of Egypt and give them what they needed in the promised land. This forced the Israelites to go to war with other nations and acquire slaves. This is because Satan isn't as powerful as the real God and has to work with limited means.\n\n* An early sect of Christians known as the Gnostics had their own set of scriptures inspired by Jesus, and many of them believed that Jesus came to inform them that the God of the Old Testament was a lesser, corrupt God and not the one true God. The early church killed all the Gnostics and burned all their writings. The implication of this is that there were alternative views of Jesus that have been suppressed and the New Testament only contains the scriptures that the early religious leaders wanted people to be aware of.\n\n* Satan made it a virtue to believe something the more questionable it is, i.e., faith. A very clever tactic. Some of Satan's other tactics:\n\n  * Fill the Bible with \"God is good\" and \"this is God's divine word\" and people will begin to believe it once they have read it enough times.\n\n  * Do something good once for people a long time ago (i.e. freeing the Israelites from Egypt) and they'll be convinced you're good from then on. It doesn't matter what you do or say afterwards or how many thousands of years of suffering your people endured afterwards.\n\n  * Do something powerful or at least convince people that you have done something powerful (e.g. parting the red sea) and they'll assume you're good because you are powerful. Might is right.\n\n  * Make people want to believe in The Bible: a divine mother/father that watches over everyone, life after death, heaven, the return of Jesus and the coming of the Golden Age.\n\n  * Make people afraid of deconverting: fear of eternal torment, fear of being wrong, fear of punishment, fear of wasted investment (sunk cost fallacy), fear of losing their sense of identity and belonging, etc.\n\n  * Indoctrinate people from birth. People tend to stick to the religion/worldview they grew up with meaning the majority of people's beliefs are rooted in circumstance and have nothing to do with devotion to truth or objective thinking.\n\n  * Fill in the vacuum left by the real God. Satan doesn't have to outcompete the real God. Satan just has to appear to be more convincing/attractive than the alternative religions/worldviews.\n\n* This is a stretch, but fun. [The God of the Bible is known to have 72 hidden names consisting of 3 letters each for a total of 216 letters.](https://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/1388270/jewish/72-Names-of-G-d.htm) 216 is 6\\*6\\*6. 666 is the number of the beast. Perhaps the hidden names of the God of the Bible are meant to reveal the true identity of the God of the Bible.",

Lemme take a few on here.\n\n>The people spoke against God and against Moses, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and we detest this miserable food.” Then the Lord sent poisonous serpents among the people, and they bit the people, so that many Israelites died. Numbers 21:5-6\n\nOk yup that's a thing, what's the rest of Numbers 21?\n\n>“We sinned when we spoke against the Lord and against you. Pray that the Lord will take the snakes away from us.” So Moses prayed for the people.\n\n>8 The Lord said to Moses, “Make a snake and put it up on a pole; anyone who is bitten can look at it and live.” 9 So Moses made a bronze snake and put it up on a pole. Then when anyone was bitten by a snake and looked at the bronze snake, they lived.\n\nOk, so God made snakes, and then made a device to save them all. That's a *big* piece of missing context here. Suffice to say this is another \"sin leads to death, God is life\" story of which there are many.\n\nThe Passover, also seems quite like the above, rejecting God is death, following him is life.\n\n>Jesus said no one knew the Father, aka the real God, except him\n\nJesus *is* God, so yes he probably knows God in a way no human does. This isn't convincing at all.\n\n>The Bible and Christian doctrine is full of fear and guilt because Satan feeds off these negative emotions. This is why Satan had included hell, emphasized sin, set unreasonable standards, turned biological drives into a factory of guilt, etc.\n\nThis sounds like an opinion of how you feel it should make people feel. Christian doctrine is full of joy and hope. Easily dismissed.\n\n>God's apparent demand for worship. Only Satan would have an ego that needs to be stoked through worship.\n\nWorship is the respect due to something, specifically the creator and maintainer of the world. I'd say that's pretty reasonable ask to be respected for giving everything life.\n\n>The God of the Bible is very authoritarian. This is because Satan despises freedom and views humans as characters in The Sims that he can direct this way and that way.\n\nThis and your other \"this is because Satan dislikes X\" make no sense. Unlimited freedom and disobedience would be something Satan would *love*. Ultimate freedom to place yourself first and heed only your own desires? This is just a bad framing of what Satan is.\n\n> Perhaps the hidden names of the God of the Bible are meant to reveal the true identity of the God of the Bible.\n\n666 is (most likely) Nero Caesar. Revelation is not a prophecy but apocalyptic literature meant to bolster the faith of those living through persecution. A fairly common genre.\n\n>Make people afraid of deconverting: fear of eternal torment, fear of being wrong, fear of punishment, fear of wasted investment (sunk cost fallacy), fear of losing their sense of identity and belonging, etc.\n\nMost of the eternal torment discussion comes from the NT, not the OT which really makes your claim backwards. There *wasn't* a claim of eternal damnation common to OT works.\n\nAnd well, to go to what you say earlier.\n\n>Hell, eternal torment\n\nWe don't really know what Hell is aside from eternal separation from God, a lot of the eternal torment ideas are based on people's interpretations and writings like Dante.\n\n>nonsensical means to salvation\n\nNot even sure what you're aiming for here, there's a *ton* of writing about salvation in the Bible and beyond, and most of it makes sense (ok, Sola Fide doesn't but hey not everything is right).\n\n>The implication of this is that there were alternative views of Jesus that have been suppressed and the New Testament only contains the scriptures that the early religious leaders wanted people to be aware of.\n\nThe new testament is the books most commonly used at the time. The argument that \"it's the books the religious leaders wanted people to read\" is well, duh.\n\nThe Bible does not include a list of books to be included in the Bible. The Bible doesn't call for anything to be written down at all. There are *a lot* of works outside the Bible that have religious truth to them, and people *do* read them, the ones in the Bible were given special importance, but want to read the Doctors of the Church? Go for it. Papal encyclicals, have at it. The Bible is the start of Christian teaching, not the end.\n\nThe problem with the Gnostics was fundamental heretical views, they weren't \"Christian\" as we'd understand it. It *usually* a dualistic religion, and as such would be clearly heretical under the understanding of Christianity. Far more different than Protestantism and Orthodoxy.\n\n>Satan made it a virtue to believe something the more questionable it is, i.e., faith\n\nAgain if you're going for OT vs NT this is explicitly an issue. NT God also talks significantly about faith and the value of it.\n\n>Indoctrinate people from birth. People tend to stick to the religion/worldview they grew up with meaning the majority of people's beliefs are rooted in circumstance and have nothing to do with devotion to truth or objective thinking.\n\nYes people do tend to not seek truth, but the failure of humans to seek the truth doesn't really say anything except about humanity.\n\nI'm not convinced here.",

There's a lot of \"God is life, not God is death\" in the Bible, as a philosophy.\n\n>What is wrong with Sola Fide? What is an example of a means of salvation that makes sense?\n\nAside from Jesus himself saying it's not enough (Matthew 25 among many others), it's a novel doctrine created centuries after Jesus with no basis in theology, and tied into a doctrine of justification (Penal Substitution) that is wholly at odds with the general messages of Jesus. And is based on \"faith in Jesus is all you need to go to heaven, and the requirement\" when there's clearly people going to heaven *before Jesus*.\n\nSalvation is through the grace of God, not by virtue of having belief.\n\n>Justification establishes cooperation between God's grace and man's freedom. On man's part it is expressed by the assent of faith to the Word of God, which invites him to conversion, and in the cooperation of charity with the prompting of the Holy Spirit who precedes and preserves his assent:\n\nCatechism 1993, Sola Fide is the first half of that equation, but lacks the cooperation of charity that preserves your assent. Sola Fide is \"we're in a solid marriage because we said our vows, even if I'm a rampant cheater, and you're abusive\". It takes more than that, you have to work, respect each other, follow the vows, cooperate. That's how you get a good marriage. Salvation is different, but that's a basic allegory.\n\n>If Christianity as we understand it happens to be wrong in some details, then wouldn't that make heresy a good thing rather than a problem?\n\nExcept it's a heresy that doesn't make sense in any type of Christian doctrine. Dualism is pretty much a no-go from the start. Among other issues.\n\nAs a competing *different* religion if you want to argue that it makes sense, but it's wholly incompatible with Christianity. Like Arianism.",

Isn't that exactly like Catholicism!  Hell,  christianity and bible as a whole!! Catholic are a sect, too , like Protestantism!! What an idiotic argument! This is infantile level stuff!!  Every religion is unsupported by anything other than itself !! Did anyone prove god yet?\n\nCatholics suffer from the same weak argument you heap on others. Jesus, does it echo when you talk? Having it too far up yours. Read up on Nicaea and try and be honest. After all what would jesus do? Not be pyreDruid, probably. Be Jewish, I guess.\n\nEdit: u/PyreDruid ran away, because it couldn't answer basic questions. Speaks volumes about its 'faith'.",

What is to stop a person from worshiping Jesus and being dualist?\n\nMatthew 4 and Luke 4 seem to make more sense under dualism. If the devil is not in opposition to God, then why would the devil try to undermine Jesus? If the devil is God's servant, then what is the devil doing with Jesus in the desert?",

The devil would tempt Jesus because he was fully human as well as being fully divine. But that doesn't mean the devil is a god.\n\nThis is just a bad interpretation of what the devil is, ascribing power to the devil that isn't the case in Christianity. The devil is a creation of God, fallen through free will. A creation of God cannot be an equal to the creator.\n\nAs far as why you can't, well that's pretty much repeated many many times in the bible. Genesis, Ten Commandments, John, etc.",

According to whom is the devil not a supreme being?\n\n>The devil would tempt Jesus because he was fully human as well as being fully divine.\n\nMay we have more details about this explanation? What difference does Jesus being fully human make to the devil? What might the devil be trying to achieve?\n\n>The devil is a creation of God, fallen through free will. A creation of God cannot be an equal to the creator.\n\nWhy cannot a creation be equal to the creator? An automobile can drive faster than a human can run, and this has not stopped humans from creating cars. A computer can do calculations faster than a human, and this has not stopped humans from creating computers. A tower can stand taller than a human, and so on.
