He has a LOT of signs of having a stroke earlier this year.\n\n1. Sudden trip to hospital\n2. Follow up with neuro testing that is used to assess cognitive ability in patients with recent neuro dysfunction.\n3. Signs of unilateral weakness, such as being unable to lift the cup of water.\n4. Face not moving symmetrically when he talks, which I thought was most obvious in the video posted before he went to the hospital.\n5. If you carefully watch the footage of him walking to Marine 1 from the house, he stumbled slightly twice, but this may be due to him being sick.\n6. He has high cholesterol which is major risk factor for having a stroke.\n\nSorry for the formatting/lack of sources, I am on mobile.  I'm sure there are many signs but these are only the ones I can think of now.",

So he used the razor on the linked audio / video. Should've unlinked, placed the morph cut a few frames earlier than where the audio cuts, just fill in the gap with room tone. Could've even slowed down the footage or frame hold to do the cut.",

Well, you can cut the cough out, but because you’re using that single camera, there’s nothing else to work with—you cut the unsavory stuff & have a weird jump cut there. It doesn’t look natural. People will notice.\n\nBut say you’re also working with a second camera, rolling at the same time, but at a different angle. Trump coughs, but you can cut all that stuff out. You won’t get that “jump” cut, because it’s a second angle. Think of a movie when you’re watching a scene, and the editor cuts to multiples angles. They’re prob cutting out flubbed lines, or bloopers, etc. It makes it look fluid and the viewers never think about it.",

I might have spent like 5 minutes dipping in and out of a window, moved to a different window, came back to that one looking for people before I saw someone to shoot at. So I start with 1st person view, duck out once, switch to my reverse facecam (a camera on the front of my gun pointed back at me) as I do another duck (skipping 3 minutes of footage). I switch to my guncam (the camera sighted down my gun) to skip another 2 minutes, and then I'm shooting at a person. With audio blending of the transitions it seems like it all happened back to back in order instead of skipping anything.",

The Soviet Union was such a black box to most Americans that we literally had no idea who was in charge of the USSR for about the last four years of his presidency, including the Moscow Olympics, where of course a dictator was expected to play a prominent role.\n\nNobody knew who the leader of our greatest enemy was, whether he was really in charge, whether he was even capable of Performing the most basic of duties. This is such a Hallmark of authoritarian dictatorships. It is long past time for the 25th Amendment to have been involved and Pence absolutely needs to be put forth as the acting president.\n\nEdit: I hate my phone's voice to text.
