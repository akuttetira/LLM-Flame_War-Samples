    "post_text ": "Maybe there is a God. Maybe there isn't. But if we apply human logic to a divine being, I believe we can conclude that a merciful God would never allow children to die of cancer. \n\nThere is no reason for a child to die slowly, agonizingly, possibly knowing their end is near and having to deal with the existential dread. This seems cruel and sadistic to allow this to happen if you have the power to stop it. \n\nI've heard a few reasons people have given, but none of them have even tried to explain the rationale behind an All Powerful, and merciful God allowing a child to die of cancer.\n\nOne reason was that life is a test. So, did these children fail God's test? This is such a ridiculous reason because a child died way too young and didn't even get a chance to study for this sadistic test. They were too young to understand the concepts of heaven/hell, sins and free will. Why not set a minimum age for these \"tests\"? It doesn't seem fair that some murderers have lived a long comfortable life while children have died young and painfully. It seems unjust to allow that to happen when you are all powerful and have the power to stop/prevent it. \n\nSome people say God will ensure that children that die young will get the highest place in heaven. Sounds great. Only one problem. Why did they have to suffer for months before getting this place in heaven. Couldn't a merciful God let the children die quicker and painlessly? Also, is it fair that the children's family have to suffer in this lifetime in order to secure this child's place in heaven? The child most likely didn't ask to be separated from their family. So why make this choice for them, because the child sure as hell didn't make the choice. \n\nAnother reason is that God works in mysterious ways. The biggest cop out excuse I've ever heard. Oh yeah let's let kids who've barely begun life, suffer and die in a slow, agonizing way. That's real mysterious all right. Not even Sherlock Holmes could deduce the logic behind such a reason. Maybe it was population control? Too many people would cause civilization to collapse. Deaths must occur to bring balance to life? Seems kind of ridiculous right? Especially since God could take out so many other people in order to ensure population control. Children should be the lowest priority. But who are we to question this mysterious God's logic. \n\nIf you believe God is merciful, and you don't think God allows children to die of cancer, that technically means don't believe God interferes in this universe. Meaning God may exist as a force that created the universe but doesn't interfere in it. That means your prayers do nothing and your religion is man made.\n\nIf you believe God interferes in this universe, that means God allows children to die, slowly, painfully. That means God is not merciful. \n\nSo which is it?",

Better and better.\n\nBut let’s just dissect some of the nonsense here.\n\nYour claims.\n\n>How can a human seriously claim God did an injustice to some kids who, in the islamic paradigm, would be too busy enjoying paradise completely forgetful of their life with cancer.\n\n1. Torturing a child is good as long as you are nice to them afterwards…\n\n> seeing the condition of those less fortunate, whatever that condition may be, is designed to soften your heart and remind you to be grateful for what you have\n\n2. Torturing a child is good if it makes someone else grateful they are not being tortured….\n\nDo you ever stop and think about what you are saying? I’m not sure what worse being a sociopath or worshipping someone for being a psychopath.",
