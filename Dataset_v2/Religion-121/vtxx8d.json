    "post_text ": "Let’s take, for example, this alternate explanation: everyone who says they saw Jesus returned from the dead lied. \n\nChristians will often debunk this by saying that it wouldn’t be beneficial to anyone to lie about this and would in fact be costly. In short, they debunk this by saying it’s just really unlikely that people would act this way. It just doesn’t happen. \n\nYou know what else is really unlikely? People coming back from the dead. It just doesn’t happen. Christians in fact emphasize how this shows Jesus was divine specifically because it’s just so unlikely and unique that only god could make it happen. \n\nTake any alternate explanation and you’ll see them logic it away by saying those explanations are too wild or too unlikely. And yet, they ignore how unlikely a resurrection is. \n\nThey essentially say that people lying, people hallucinating, people being wrong about what they saw, etc are just too wild and nonsensical, but someone being the physical incarnation of a deity and resurrecting themself is perfectly reasonable and in fact somehow the most reasonable conclusion. \n\nIt’s simply unfair and illogical.  It almost feels like it’s from a comedy sketch. \n\nImagine someone says they fell from a building and got saved by a flying magical superhero who moved extremely fast and flew without using machinery.  You ask if Superman saved them. They reply, with complete seriousness, that you have asked a stupid question because Superman isn’t real.  \n\nThat’s what Christians sound like dismissing alternate resurrection hypotheses for being too unlikely or unreasonable.",

What they believed were demonic possessions were likely things like schizophrenic episodes or seizures. What they perceived as a witch was a woman who knew something more than a man did. Hell, the people who saw the first ever camera footage of a train coming towards them got scared and tried to get out of the way because they thought it was a real train coming at them.\n\nThe resurrection is obviously something with a rational explanation, but we have literally no supporting evidence other than the Bible's claim. And Christians just take it as fact because they've been raised to believe it's all true.",

He himself says beyond the physical is spiritual and humans are spirits.\n\nAnd there’s people who’ve come back from the dead in this day and age. A Christian brother was run over by a truck, his car mangled, skid marks on his shirt, and he got up fine.\n\nEveryone around him freaking out and paramedics in the ambulance saying they see nothing wrong and confused because cops and witnesses said he was run over by a truck.\n\nThat brother loves God deeply and cries every time, every year he celebrates that day.\n\nYou can’t begin to understand.",

Until you demonstrate a supernatural god in a lab setting, you're talking out of your arse. Saying that I can't begin to understand doesn't make your position more intriguing or complex, it's just a psychological defence mechanism for your own interpretation being just that: your interpretation.\n\nTake your claim that people have come back from the dead. Not only is it completely anecdotal, you'd have to replicate it under a setting with controlled variables to definitely prove it was an act of a deity that saved him.",

It means these visions and after life nde’s and more people have had since the dawn of time, are true.\n\nBut the Atheist fails to see if the universe always existed or started by chance, all values, all opinions, all ideas, apart from absolute fact, are irrelevant and useless.\n\nIt means no evil exists, no good exists, it means you have no argument to base on why God is good or bad. You lose alot of ground for even basic issue’s and it reduces the value of life to zero, because that worldview where chance brings everything we have now, means this is all just mere chance.\n\nSo all we do, means nothing because we will die one day and that is it. All we did in life? Irrelevant. The hope that our memory lives on is childish? We’d be gone completely and it doesnt matter what our legacy is, all the people who have been raped and the rapist? Nothing matter’s in regards to what both did. Both will die and cease to exist and all they did to each other did not matter.\n\nThis would mean emotions and feelings are irrelevant too. It’s all created by chance and has no value. People caring about it means nothing because they only care because or subjective feeling’s and values that has no factual basis.\n\nThis would mean everything humanity does is in vain. Taking care of the planet? Pointless, it’s mere chance earth existed and once we die we cease to exist. What value is there then in the human race continuing?\n\nNow in regards to you not understanding, you already demonstrated you do not. You do this by using flawed earthly logic that you fall to see, would result in that worldview I describe above.\nAs either this universe is created or it is not. And if it is not, you have no factual reason to even be bothered about another humans opinions.\n\nBut see, this is the issue now, you feel objective morals like all humans do when those morals are not twisted and altered in evil ways, by your very own emotions and values that are objective, you find yourself contradicting such a world view.\n\nSo then if our values, as human beings, can be objective, this highlight the world view that this world is created by chance, is false. You’re on being convicts you through objective values and emotions.\n\nThe issue here truly is you deny the foundation of where those objective feelings and values come from. God.\n\nYou’re arguments about testimonies is a poor one too. The person I described has medical evidence.\n\nYou also ignore you’re-hypocrisy. Often the Atheist like you will listen and accept anecdotal’s from another Atheist.\n\nSo you choose to pick and choose what testimony or oral statement you will accept. This is why you deny ancients from around the world describing the supernatural but you accept the natural.\n\nAnd this again relates to how you are blind and do not understand. While it is not entirely your fault, you play a willing part in not choosing to try and understand.\n\nAnd no, the standard of science which you describe is not the only standard of truth. And God is not confined to the very science he made and allowed humans to study.\n\nIn fact, there’s scientific evidences collaborate the testimony of the person I mentioned. Yet here you are denying it.\n\nThere’s alot of stories and medical documentation of many people dying and coming back and becoming Christians. But you deny what they report.\n\nThere’s alot of testimonies from even doctors on these issues, but you deny it.\n\nThe issue here clearly is not evidences. Often the issue with men and women like you is that you just make excuses to validate your lack of belief. If you really cared for truth you’d go ask for it and study it. This is what famous Atheist have done and when they have they have converted.\n\nThe main issue here apart from that is that you think science is even a standard to speak on God. It is not.\n\nScience shows the physical and natural function of something, not it’s origin, reason to exist, or it’s history. You merely look at how God physically built and created things and think that’s reason to deny God.\n\nAnd to be honest, there is physical evidences for the bible and other religions also have alot that have paper trails back to the bible and the Ancient Israelites.\n\nIn my opinion, I bet you do not even know why ancient people believed in other God’s, I’d tell you but you prove you do not understand and I am convinced it’s willfully a decision you make to not understand.\n\nSee the difference between a spiritual infant and mature one? Those who know God and study the truth have revelation and knowledge. You’re arguments are weak.\n\nYou are brave to be an Atheist though and have more faith than me.",

All ideas are opinions by the world view you present.\n\nWhy do you feel qualified to make your non factual opinion law over another persons? I can believe what I want and by the logic you present, It’s my right and I have no basis to believe it’s wrong.\n\nYou feeling it is wrong means nothing, it’s useless emotion and chemicals and subjective. It’s ideas with no factual basis. Give me a reason to care about that.\n\nSo you see the error in your world view? At least God presents a factual reason for why your feelings matter.",

Telling people they have free will to believe in him but at the same time says if you use your free will to not follow him then you burn in hell forever. Yeahhh, that’s manipulative and doesn’t sound like a real choice. Not to me anyways. But yeah, it is crazy to me that anyone can think that morals come from god… lol",
