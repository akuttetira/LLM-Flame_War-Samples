    "post_text ": "The Bible is unambiguously opposed to it. If you claim to be a Christian then you claim to follow the Bible, and so to be consistent you should be against any homosexual activity. If you believe it is God's word then you can't pick and choose which parts you like. You can't just pretend part of it is false because it is not socially palatable anymore. The Bible says what it says and this is an issue it is quite clear on.\n\nThe most common objection seems to be that it was a mistranslation. But this just seems revisionist. What major advances were made in Greek or Hebrew linguistics in the last 30 years that suddenly shed light in a wrong translation that had been accepted for centuries? It seems like an absurdly convenient coincidence that this breakthrough in linguistics just happened to come at exactly the same time homosexuality was becoming more accepted by society. It seems enormously more likely that this was just retrospective and post facto revision.",
