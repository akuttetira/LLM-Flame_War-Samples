Why is He evil? Because your subjective feelings say so? Because He does harm? Harm can be good when it punishes the wicked... so by what objective standard is harm bad? Your assertion here has no logical foundation at all\n\n>My theory is rooted in the story of the very first sin.

But the punishment seems like overkill, It's like punishing a toddler who ate a cake when told not to, by condemning them to suffer painfully and die along with all their descendents (Adam and Eve were basically toddlers at this point not in body but in mind).\n\nBeing deceived by the serpent is irrelevant. Eve even stated what God said, fairly accurately, before eating. They knew the law and disregarded it. It was their fault.\n\nThat's, again, your subjective opinion for which you have no logical foundation. Who are you to judge the severity of crime? By, again, what moral standard? If I steal 1 candy and murder 1 person I get worse consequences for the latter because of how evil it is. If I murder a random 30 yr old or murder a king I get worse consequences for the latter; because whom I commit crime against also matters. Eating the fruit was the worse crime of all, seeing as its the first, and condemned the universe to corruption... and it was against God,  the KING of kings... it's punishment is not something that could be light.\n\n>So now the reason why I think god gave such a disproportionate punishment was because man now had the ability to judge good and evil and the ability to deduce that God was evil. (explained in the previous post, link in comments).\n\nThis is all nonsensical head canon with no evidence for it whatsoever. And again, you, not they, have no logical foundation for calling God evil. It's wishful thinking in your point; an appeal to feelings\n\n>As for free will God doesn't really care for it because he hardened Pharaoh's heart simply to display his might, made an evil spirit trouble Saul to skew his judgement and skewed his judgement himself, to aid Gideon he made the Midianites turn their swords against each other, he took away Nebuchadnezzar's reason, and when Jonah used his free will God punished Jonah till he changed his mind.\n\nNo one said you had a right to free will. We said God gives it to allow us to be able to lie...\nAlso, that's nonsense. He harden Pharoahs heart after the 5th or 6th chance. Why would the King of the king need to give him 5 chance to comply with His demands? That's nonsense. If your king demands something it is to be done.\n\nSaul? You mean the evil man that also defied God and tried to kill the man God called king?\n\nGidian, the righteous man God was trying to rescue?\n\nNebuch the evil king who thought Himself a God?\n\nFunny, isn't it? It's almost like God gives you many chances to do things,  but once you prove yourself to be unrepentant from wickedness He forces to to comply. So don't be wicked and you'll be fine.\n\nAlso, He didn't force Jonah to do anything, so that example is not appropriate being paired there, with the others.\n\nRegardless, that while thing and you have yet to give a SHRED of justification for why God is evil. To be honest that's the most honest thing you did; seeing as there can be no evidence or argument made for the objective evil of God.",

You don't need to hold a PhD in logic to know these things were bad.\n\nAs for your claim of it being the greatest crime of all I don't agree there's far worse crimes than that.\n\nBruh read the bible Yahweh said he'd harden pharaohs heart long before the first plague of blood he said to Moses and Aaron \"And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land\" so he literally took away pharaohs free will to torture an entire country just so he could demonstrate his powers by poisoning their water supply, letting loose disease causing pests onto their lands, causing an artificial famine by releasing locusts into their fields, then killing their only other food source their livestock, using diseases as a weapon, making the famine worse by sending hail, killing their children, God sounds even worse than he already was someone call the Hague god's a war criminal.\n\nFine then you agree that God dosent care for free will as long as it suits his needs then why can't he just collectively take away man's ability to be evil unless he wants to see pain and suffering in the world and is infact evil,",

It's all just hot air.\n\nSaying I will harden is future tense. He did not do the hardening till the 5th or 6th plague... so yes, you need to read your Bible.\n\nIdk what you mean by doesn't care about free will, but you have no right to free will, that's for sure.\n\nBecause in taking free will (our ability to do evil) He strips us of our capacity to love.

Good, so since you have no argument or evidence for that moral standard being objective we can just dismiss it outright. Cool.\n\nAt least my morality is based on something other than my arbitrary feelings. I can actually say slavery and rape are objectively evil, all you can do is sheepishly say \"but I don't like it\".\n\nThey were done to show His glory... that country was engaging in slavery... what?  You like slavery now?\n\nYou don't have the right to anything from God. You ignored my argument, I already answered this. The greatest commands are to love God and people. We need free will, which includes the ability to do evil, in order to love. That's why. We wants us to do something and be someway and so He acts towards that goal.

Cool.\n\nIdc if you erroneously think God is subjective... if you're subjects too then eitherway is win win for us... you have no basis to judge Him. Your \"moral objections\" are no more powerful than \"I don't like chocolate\" is.",

God’s objections to actions people take are equally arbitrary. An infinite being making up rules for his creations just so he can punish them.\n\n>Great, so you agree is just his arbitrary opinion and not an argument or anything of real consequence?\n\nNo. Their opinion isn’t arbitrary, it *is* an argument, and the consequence for those who aren’t stubbornly clinging to “might makes right,” is seeing that the story of the garden does not paint god in a positive light whatsoever.",

I fail to see how this is a lost.\n\nAnd don't come at me with \"but might doesn't make right\"... you said that moral are subjective... so might could indeed make right and there's non more mighty that God.\n\n-\n\nLol, no no. You can't have it both ways. If the morality is subjective then it is arbitrary. They have no objective justification for their judgment.\n\nArguments are based on logic, reason, and other objective things, but the feels. That's not an argument.",

You don't know what you're talking about when it comes to Him.\n\n>I absolutely can say something against it. Don’t know why you think I can’t.\n\nIt's as potent as saying you don't like cereal. That's it. I mean say something against it as in say thing of value. What value does the opinion of a human have compared to the opinion of a God? Nothing.\n\n>By this logic he can’t call himself right either.\n\nThe topic is if He is wrong... so, sure, if it's subjective then He can't be objectively right... but who cares? He isn't wrong and you can't stop Him.\n\n>So?
