    "post_text ": "*This will be a shorter post than usual due to the simplicity of the argument. Nobody is going to be impressed by this, but yet it is perhaps one of the most powerful arguments out there for why non-ex-Christians won't become Christians.*  \n\nHere we go:  \n\n* **For every individual claim found in the bible or made by a Christian we must ask \"Does that usually happen?\"**  \n* **If the answer is \"no\" we have a strong justification to dismiss the claim as is.**\n\n#**Example of a claim**  \nSo if a Christian claims that Jesus rose from the dead, we must ask ourselves \"do people generally resurrect?\"  \nNo, they do not. Therefore we have no good reason to accept this claim as being likely to be true.  \n\n#**A rational response to this claim**  \n\n* The Christian might respond \"we have eyewitnesses that Jesus rose from the dead\".  \n* Then we ask ourselves: \"Is having an eyewitness normally enough to convince us that someone rose from the dead?\"   \n\nThe answer to this is no. There are claims of resurrections (outside of Christianity) even today, and in almost all religions, and we do not accept those claims on mere eyewitness testimony.\n\n#**Anti-supernatural bias**  \nA Christian might say that the non-ex-Christian atheist might be biased against supernatural things/miracles occurring. But this way of thinking works even if we assume miracles do happen. People rising from the dead is very rare; most people who die stay dead (not counting an afterlife).  \n\n#**Conclusion**   \nIt's perfectly rational to dismiss most fantastical/miraculous claims made by theists based on the likelihood alone.\n\n---\n*Please join me in upvoting the people we disagree with.*",

What kind of screwed up image did Abraham have to have of his god, and then to be praised for his obedience?\n\nI have kids and sometimes they fight. When they both come to me to tell on one another, I enjoy offering each of them a knife and telling them theirs only one way to settle it, but to do it outside to minimize clean up. Perhaps unsurprisingly, they decline to fight to the death and just get away from one another.  They know I'm not serious because I'm not psychopath.\n\nSo Abraham, having received this message, thinks 'yeah, that sounds like something the God i know would command. ' It strikes me that if Abraham viewed God as the all loving being that Christians like to describe him now, one might suspect that the message actually came from an evil spirit trying to trick him, or even that his own senses were deceiving him. And on top of that, his response isn't, 'WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? YOU THINK IT'S WANT A HUMAN SACRIFICE?! \"\n\nThere's well over 150 biases that can lead us to wrong conclusions. If you suddenly find yourself in a situation where cause and effect are suddenly suspended to benefit you, why would 'I'm misinterpretting something here' not be the fat more plausible response?",

No amount of \"debating\" is going to change the fact that _The Source / The Creator / All-Parent / God / etc._ exists.  It is akin to asking _\"Prove that you love your children / partner.\"_  **It is impossible to use Logic to \"prove\" Love.** As if _The Source / The Creator / All-Parent / God / etc._ can be reduced to a mathematical equation. LOL.\n\nThis sub is full of Atheists -- spiritual blind men arguing that color doesn't exist because they are too insecure and cowards to **Know Thyself** to actually **do the work** of opening their eyes to see, an experience a much, much, much larger reality.  Atheists _literally_ have ZERO knowledge **by definition.** They love to pretend to be armchair experts on a topic they know fuck all about -- completely clueless that **ALL Objective Truth is built upon a Subjective Experience.** They are too busy arguing with everyone else that they themselves can't hear _The Source / The Creator / All-Parent / God / etc._ constantly \"talking\" to them because that would require them to put their false ego aside for one minute and actually _listen._  It is much easier to yell at everyone else arguing how they are \"wrong\" then acknowledge they themselves are completely missing the entire fucking point of being on the Earth School: _To learn to have unconditional compassion, and to empower relationships._ It is kind of hard to invest in oneself when one is too busy arguing with everyone else.  Go figure.\n\nThere is little point to debate archaic ideas regardless if they are arrogant Atheists or ignorant Theists.  _You can't fill a glass already full_ to use a bad analogy.  There is no point to reply when \"the judge\" has already made up their mind and decided the outcome before seeing all the facts.  Most Atheists are coward pseudo-skeptics -- they aren't the least bit interested in:\n\n* learning a different perspective,\n* all beliefs are valid but not all are beneficial,\n* understanding how all religions are correct yet simultaneously incomplete,\n* let alone developing their own religion by building their own relationship with _The Source / The Creator / All-Parent / God / etc._\n* there are infinite paths to enlightenment\n* understanding that everyone has their own path to enlightenment.\n\nThey love to get hung up on the Letter of the law and ignore the Spirit of the law not realizing that:\n\n1. Enlightenment is a Journey not a Destination.\n2. Religion is Spiritual kindergarten.  Different \"schools\" exist because people learn in different manners. e.g. Some need ritual. Some don't. Some need traditional. Some don't. Some need the cloak of pseudo-history. Some don't.\n3. There are TWO kinds of Truth: _Intellectual_ and _Experiential._ One can't learn the latter out of a book. Our relationship with _The Source / The Creator / All-Parent / God / etc._ also falls on in the latter -- but it doesn't stop children  from attempting to try to make it into the former.\n\nFor example, the ENTIRE Hebrew / Christian Bible can be summarized in 6 words.\n\n1. Love unconditionally.\n2. Judge only thyself correctly.\n\nAnything more is intellectual masturbation whining about dogma AKA **this sub.**\n\nYet the constant excuses for why _The Source / The Creator / All-Parent / God / etc._ \"can't exist\" never stops.",

It literally means nothing other than \"I don't believe in gods\".  That's it.  And speaking form personal experience, we believe that because we haven't been presented with any convincing argument for it's truth.  Comments and posts like yours, wielded like vague, platitude-soaked cudgels, make that even harder for us.  It's hard not to think \"well, this guy is a true believer, that's for sure, but if what he's saying explains his thought process as to WHY he believes, then he didn't come to that conclusion by any method I recognize as coherent thought\" and dismiss it as the rantings of someone who was always taught WHAT to think instead of HOW to think.\n\nIt's clear you're not interested in participating in the intended purpose of this sub.
