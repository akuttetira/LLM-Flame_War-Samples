That would be great if we actually got to hear from them. But do we know any of their identities? Do we have any of their testimonies? Since when does *saying there were witnesses* mean anything? The whole point of eyewitness testimony is to... hear from the eyewitnesses.

This theologian makes the case that the life and example and teaching of Christ should have been sufficient to bring about the necessary change in human consciousness (and connect people with their own concept of a Creator) and that the physical resurrection was really unnecessary.\n\nFor example, Socrates was a great thinker, but no one would even lay down their life for Socrates or to embellish his legacy. So the theologians sort of had to make this big investment in the physical resurrection concept.\n\nThe aftermath of the teachings of Christ on the world are the only legacy that counts - quite challenging and transformative in the early years - but later twisted into political and cultural control afterwards.\n\nI think it is curious that  in the Quran, which validates some of the facts of Christ's life (virgin birth), and even ascribes more miracles to him (even as a small child),  it deliberately downplays the whole crucifixion and resurrection storyline.\n\nIt reminds me in the NT, how Jesus seemed almost obsessed with getting people to rethink the purpose behind the older Jewish laws on diet, social interactions, and observance of rituals as meaningless parroting of empty form at the expense of higher-intended virtues. Even as he preached the notion of a loving Creator, all the people wanted to see were just more \"signs and miracles\" to establish his credentials as a prophet.\n\nI have spoken to persons who converted from Christianity to Islam and they seem rather relieved to not feel obligated to support the notion of a physical resurrection, as if they never could accept it in the first place but felt uncomfortable admitting that as Christians. For them, the Quran paints the relationship between mankind and Creator in a broader way.\n\nI do not agree with all the dogma either in Islam, because I see plenty of man-made interpolations in there, but if your consider these prophets primarily as Educators - in a generous sense - then at least with Islam you are generally moving in the right direction away from literalism and physical miracles, or that certain dogma are off the table\" for discussion.",

As with all claims of physical miracles, these all fail as proof of any religious tradition.Even if you were to witness these events yourself, it would not serve as proof for a person who is absent.\n\nI think the purpose of reporting such miracles in Holy Books is to ask people to look at their inward reality. For example, if a blind man suddenly gains vision through a miracle, he will soon lose it anyway when he dies, so what was the point?\n\nEven if a person dies and was resurrected, what is the point? Resurrect Mahatma Gandhi: good idea. Resurrect Adolf Hitler: bad idea.\n\nIn other words, physical miracles, if they occur, primarily have an inward meaning.\n\nI would argue that a focus on physical miracles is - in the classical philosophical sense - an example of extreme \"materialism\".\n\nThere is the story in the NT where Jesus chided a man for being afraid to leave his home and help spread the message of a new, broader social concept of brotherhood.. The man was so consumed with the Jewish custom of mourning his recently deceased father for a full year that Jesus just said, \"Let the (spitiually) dead bury the (physical) dead).\"\n\nThe virgin birth is an interesting concept because if it were true, or even if people believed  it were true, then they would reject Jesus and his message primarily for reasons of social taboo. One of the central theme of the Gospel is that were all all equal children of a Creator- with certain bounties and birthrights - which transcend our social and ethnic \"handicaps\".\n\nThe challenge is not that you would accept or reject the doctrine of a virgin birth -or any physical miracle.\n\nThe challenge is whether or not this forms a veil in your mind through which you cannot perceive the reality of your relationship (kinship) with other who are different than you.\n\nIt works both ways:\n\nFor those who consider acceptance of the physical miracle as a foundation of faith, they are also looking down on others who lack that 'leap of (blind) faith\". Therefore, this is contrary to the goal of religion to bring together people of diverse backgrounds.\n\nSimilarly, if you simply state that such events cannot happen or did not happen, you look at those who believe in such things as weak-minded and gullible and \"afraid the face the real world\". So you avoid these communities of people, even if within them actual character transformations do take place (for whatever reason).",

Add to this the fact that jesus was a carpenter from a very backwater town (Nazareth), as opposed to being a scholar from an honorable family in Jerusalem, and it all just seems like a non-starter.\n\nThe audience that awaited Jesus was a society of oppressed people (Jews and others in Judea), then layers of priestly doctrine in which obedience to The Law (as interpreted by the clergy) was absolute (think Taliban), and since the Romans didn't want any trouble, they used the locals to enforce order.\n\nFor example, the one time when Jesus really got upset was with the money-changers in  the Temple. The Jews were expected to travel once a year to Jerusalem to make a sacrifice and hopefully improve their family's future through prayers and rituals.\n\nHowever, even before entering into this process, the clergy essentially said , \"The money you have is impure and not acceptable in God's eyes for this sacred obligation,. However, for a fee we will gladly change it into acceptable, 'blessed' coinage and then you may carry out your pilgrimage/sacrificial obligations.\"\n\nIn other words, they were not just charging you to purchased \"blessed goats and lambs' - they were charging you just to use your own money.\n\nOne of the patterns we see if just about any new faith tradition is that the people who receive the new Messenger are at the absolute nadir of oppression, self-inflicted prejudice and ignorant superstition and adherence to the \"letter\" of the Law, rather than the \"spirit\" of the Law  (which supposedly involves character growth and reflection).\n\nIt is almost as if to say that there are so many initial barriers to the people to accept the radical new message (and the Messenger) that if the message does change hearts and gains some traction in changing society (even if it takes generations), then there must be something to it.\n\nRemember that in the time of Jesus there was no real established pattern of brotherhood beyond the family and tribe, let alone a city-state filled with Jews, Romans, Egyptian, Samaritans, etc.\n\nBy the very definition, you probably should never judge the Message or Messenger by the standards of society of the time because they are already too corrupt to be useful.",

Assyrian, Babylonian and Egyptian mythologies included narratives involving parthenogenesis among various deities, but it wasn't viewed with scorn. Just the opposite, in fact - it was what goddesses did!\n\nIn Hebrew tradition, when Sarah was well along in years, a little divine intervention enabled her to give give birth to Isaac. Although the blessed event was greeted with skepticism, it wasn't treated as blasphemy. Again, just the opposite. Abraham threw her a big party, and all the notables brought their wives, who each took a sip of Sarah's breast milk, thus proving the impossible child was hers.\n\nAlso in Hebrew tradition is the virgin birth of Melchizidek. His mother Sopanima (Noah's sister in law) died at Mel's birth, but he was definitely in God's good graces. Just before the Deluge, the angel Gabriel evacuated him to the Garden of Eden, where he sat out the Big Flood. Once again, no shame or diapproval. (Sopanima did die, but not as a punishment.)\n\nSo... no sign of parthenogenesis shaming in the ancient literature.\n\nYou will recall that the first written gospel, Mark, had no birth story. But Matthew, aware that deities weren't typically conceived like other beings, and that the incarnation of a sinless being like Jesus couldn't begin with a depraved act of lust, gave us an immaculate conception. (Keeping up with the neighboring religions, so to speak.)\n\nLuke followed suit, as he did in many aspects of his heavily plagiarized gospel.\n\nYou suggest that \"presenting the notion of a virgin birth\" would result in social rejection. That doesn't exactly apply to the Jesus story.\n\nMatthew tells us nothing about Mary's nine months of pregnancy. His interest is solely in the plight of Joseph, who is bewildered by the pregnancy of his (presumably virginal) betrothed. Finally an angel comes to the rescue and tells Joseph to relax and enjoy it, which he does.\n\nThen, after nine months of who knows what, we jump to Bethlehem, the Magi, the flight to Egypt and all that.\n\nLuke, on the other hand, starts by telling us about the birth of John the Baptist to Mary's sister Elizabeth - another case of divine intervention, as Elizabeth was old  - older than Mary.\n\nAfter the busy angel Gabriel tells Mary of her rather unusual pregnancy, she interacts only with Elizabeth. We have no idea how she spent her pregnancy.\n\nAfter the birth of JtB, Luke skips to the birth of Jesus, telling us that the newborn was greeted by a host of angels, who in turned announced the literally blessed event to the shepherds in the surrounding fields, who in their turn praised and glorified God. Then we cut to 12-year-old Jesus lecturing priests at the Temple.\n\nOnce again, no indication of shunning, either of Elizabeth or of Mary.\n\nIn conclusion... looks like your blasphemy hypothesis is nothing more than speculation.\nGiven the fact that human parthenogenesis is impossible, there's no reason for such a taboo to become widespread.\n\nAnd lastly, none of it really matters, because it's a made-up story. Eighty years after the purported virgin conception, the anonymous author of Matthew lifted and mistransated the whole virgin birth idea from Isaiah 7:14, the birth of Hezekiah.",

Unless you think he is a liar, which is quite improbable. Anyway it really shouldn't be used as a central point of any argument.",

Using *only* the seven Pauline letters  considered genuine by most scholars (1st Thessalonians, Galatians, 1st Corinthians , Philippians, Philemon,\n2nd Corinthians and Romans), tell us four or five facts reported by Paul about Jesus' birth, his ministry in Galilee, his days  preaching in Jerusalem, and his trial and crucifixion. In other words, the entire time he spent on earth as a man.\n\nRemember - use only Paul's epistles! The first gospel, Mark, was written at least 20 years after Paul had passed, so that's off limits. And leave post-resurrection appearances out of this. We're talking about Jesus' *time as a man on earth,* not as a supernatural spirit being. Please don't forget to include the chapter and verse of each reference.\n\nI won't hold my breath.",

And what about the big welcome he got when he entered Jerusalem on what Christians call Palm Sunday?!\n\n-- Jesus was not a servant (slave) except in the metaphorical sense.\n\n-- it's hard to tell from this passage whether Paul agreed with the docetists that Jesus was made (\"Made\"? Not born?) in the \"form\" of a servant and the \"likeness\" of men, but wasn't an actual flesh-and-blood human being. Or whether Paul regarded Jesus as a celestial being whose death on the cross took place not on earth but in one of the heavenly domains.\n\nEven though Paul visited Jerusalem many times, he never mentioned that it was the site of Jesus'  Trial, Crucifixion and Resurrection.",

He's life was upside down because of it, he lost his important position, is one of the only apostles that  we can have some level of certainty for the martyrdom, narrates things with great confidence and gets genuinely mad when people downplay his importance, probably actually had a vision and believed it, doesn't back down even if he has to flee the town not to be stoned, quit his faith (which was a big deal to a first century Jew) and etc.\n\nNow, what I think is the case is that he probably heard this from someone, but I think he hardly would accept something at face value without having a trustworthy source, given the care for the revelation in his gospels and how he doesn't take get his information from \"any man but from Jesus\". Alternative hypothesis would be that he is just throwing something he heard in the mix to convince people or that he is lying to bring them closer to God, which he is known to do. But that he heard from someone and trusted it would be a more likely scenario. He doesn't claim to be there and wouldn't have counted the 500 heads.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThinking back, maybe \"quite improbable\" was an overstatement. To phrase it better: That he was lying about what his faith is quite improbable, and if he considers this to be a cornerstone of his gospel is also unlikely, if not I still see the case for his telling the truth (mistaken or not) as more probable.",

So much so he either had revelations for his gospels or extremely good sources, since far from Jerusalem, in the context of early Christianity, only by whatever his \"revelations\" are, he got a message approved by the apostles.",

If the problem was his past persecution of Christians the \"from the womb\" thing also should not help his case that much.\n\nBut it's not one thing, are all the instances that he defends his authority that end up painting this picture. Fits well with the text and is a more \"straight forward\" reading. I would take some time to compile the whole case and probably would forget something.\n\nLooking into the subject that is the most common view I could find, be it scholarly opinions or the discussions I end up reading online. It also the impression I get while reading his defenses.\n\nAnyway, this is a reading supported by the text, so the argument that he cared about authority and not sources does not necessarily hurt the case. I actually do think his audience didn't care about sources, but the fact that he reassures his authority by affirming everything he says goes back to Jesus while the pillars get this presupposes of them raises the red flag.",

So if we are to take him at his word, the 'reliable source' is the risen Jesus or God. Given my skepticism for claims like that, I think it's much more likely that he had heard about the Christian belief set while he was 'persecuting' them or some other means (talking to Christians). So it's not too impressive that Paul, a Christian, knew what Christians were saying.\n\nThere's a giant chasm between 'Paul refined, altered, and propagated popular ideas being spread in Christian communities around the Roman Mediterranean world' (my take) and 'Paul must have had a reliable source for the things he was saying about the risen Jesus and His message' (a Christian take). Given that Christians weren't overly concerned about historicity, and authority was paramount, stories and ideas were prone to change if someone who could 'establish' more 'authority' had a different idea.\n\nPaul, a guys who didn't learn anything from the real living Jesus, challenged Peter to his face because Peter was condemnable. And Peter is supposedly *the rock* on which Jesus built his church. I don't get a sense of harmony int he earliest church - Paul shows us there was disagreement and infighting, and we know from history that even the most major components of the theology hadn't been settled.\n\nThat's why I don't think we get much mileage out of the idea that \"Paul had the same message as the other apostles, therefore he must have had *some* reliable source.*",

He stayed 15 days with Peter, went to confirm his gospel and talk specifically to the pillars of the church about his beliefs about Jesus (not only getting right through visions and without reliable means to know for sure, which is also another strong point) and he also met them a couple of other times.\n\nHe was also very stubborn with what went into his gospel, given how people Suspected of him, and said he got it from no man. So when he talks about something he is received and is of importance to his gospel, the apostles are the first ones that come to mind. Also, he discussed his preachings with them, and the approved it, presumably, this too. Even if not formally, informally he got to know at least Peter very well, and would be implausible to think he didn't talk about the most important topic in the room with him. Of course, that is the only eyewitess testemony of christianity. It is second hand but it's far from bad from a historic perspective and he even gives the order of appearances, to an extent.\n\nSo is more probable than not that the creed is actually rooted on apostolic testimony, if not given to him by them. There is also the apologetic of the empty tomb from this passage, but I don't buy it.",

He describes talking to James, John and Peter about his message and it's nature. Not only about their own experiences, but the others too. Even in private conversations, Paul stayed 15 days with Peter, it is probable that they talked about it, was kind of the elephant in the room. It also works well with the preconceived notions of what the disciples preached. At least is better than the 500, and it is not the only thing Paul brings to the table, though he is the only one bringing something. It probably is eyewitness testimony of the risen Jesus, if not direct testimony that Paul got straight from them. It's not something that would change someone's mind, believer or not, but if eyewitness testimony is enough for you, at least it can stop a deconvertion.",

If the pope spends a month in the house of a religious old lady in Venezuela, it's presumably that they will talk about religion at least once.

On top of that, he probably talked about when he went to confirm his gospel in Jerusalem, and this seems like a particularly important part of it. History deals with probabilities, with this being the most probable scenario.\n\nBut even if none of it was on to play, it would already be stronger evidence than the five hundred, given he actually knows the people he is talking about from multiple lasting encounters.",

It's hard to even imagine a conversation they would have that doesn't touch this topic, so it is presumed that they did unless something contradicts it.\n\nBut the main thing is that he verified his gospel with them, the point that they probably talked about it in the time they spent together also holds up on its own, but is not the central argument, and Paul's assertion that everything he preaches goes back to Jesus corroborates. So it's more likely than not that the subject came to them from Paul and nothing that they said changed his mind.

Twenty years later, the anonymous author of Mark, taking bits and pieces from Paul and mainly from the Septuagint, invented Jesus' Galilean ministry, which included 12 apostles, two of whom were ready-made by Paul.",

You assume that they discussed Jesus' teachings and the events in Jesus' life, including the Trial and Crucifixion, but Paul himself tells us no such thing. Paul tells us nothing about any discussions with the Pillars about Jesus' time in Galilee and Jerusalem.\n\nWhere does Paul tell us he discussed his teachings with Peter and James, or with any of the apostles? Which did he say they approved of? Chapter and verse, please.\n\nIf we think the Jerusalem Pillars were the same Peter and James that had been Jesus' companions during his earthly ministry, and if we believe Paul set forth in 1 Cor a full and honest account of the two weeks he spent with two eyewitnesses to the words and deeds of Jesus of Nazareth, we can only conclude that they never got around to discussing the words and deeds of the Son of God. Or that Paul didn't think the words and deeds of the Son of God were important enough to share with his far-flung congregations.\n\nKeeping in mind that Mark didn't write his gospel until 70 AD, about 20 years after Paul's meeting with the Jerusalem pillars, how do you account for Paul's glaring omission?",

They at the bear minimum didn't contradict the idea that he had of the post resurrection appearances.\n\nAnd they approve his preaching \"They added nothing to my message. On the contrary, they recognized that I had been entrusted with the task of preaching the gospel to the uncircumcised\". He got his preachings by revelation, as he wants to make clear, these are the words from Jesus, not from a man. He hardly would be able to get to the same as they (and by extension Jesus) In the turmoil of early churches with different and wild beliefs about the nature of Crist and what he used to say in life.\n\nHe also says he met John, asides from Peter, James and presumably he heard about other and potentially met them too at some point, given he talks about how he didn't meet the rest of them during his first visit, along with some other stuff he talks about.\n\nWith that out of the way, I never claimed he met all of them. Meeting 3+ of the people them and hearing about the others, presumably from them as well, and more probably than not checking the information with or getting it from those people, already would make this a second hand eyewitness testimony.\n\nAnd yes, I consider this Peter to be the same Peter from the twelve because of Occam's razor. A Jewish early christian that was one of the pillars of the church, surrounded himself with people that happen to share a name with the twelve, was not only known as an apostle but somethingSingles him out and the people that share the name with the twelve as more important \"super apostles\", has the same nickname as the Peter of the gospels, preached in Jerusalem, Paul felt like he had to verify something he got directly from Jesus with him and the others for some reason and so on and so forth. On top of that he never does anything that would mischaracterise him as Peter. And again, when you are talking about history, you can't be 100% sure, just sure enough.\n\nAlso, the epistles bring some other minor stuff to the table.",

Anyway it really shouldn't be used as a central point of any argument.\n\nWell for starters, S/Paul talks quite openly about having some kind of affliction, a \"thorn in his flesh\". A really practical interpretation of that, is severe epilepsy. Which also explains his conversion story... a flash of light, a voice that only he heard (yeah I know its a contradiction, acts 9 says others heard the voice, acts 22 says only he heard it). Followed by blindness and the inability to eat.\n\nThe man's own accounts call his mental health into question. While obviously we can't tell from now. Paul made refrences to having some affliction. A \"Messenger of satan\". I'd say it is absolutely a reasonable possibility that he wasn't hearing god's voice... but just hearing voices.",

The doctor doesn't mean much, look now we've got crazy people with medical degrees, and 2. Being a doctor didn't really mean that much back then. We barely understand mental conditions now, let alone back then. Calling someone from 2000 years ago a \"doctor\" is like calling a carpenter an Auto mechanic. I mean it is the closest to an auto mechanic they had back then... they made wheels and waggons I'm sure. But of course no one had invented any type of engines. Just as doctors did what they could, probably understood how to make splints, and basic casts. But of course they understood very little about what makes someone sick.\n\n\nFar as making an impact getting followers, why not? I can absolutely find dozens of people in the modern era who you'd probably agree with me were mentally ill that got followers, Jonestown, Manson etc.... There's many many more that wouldn't be so internationally known because they didn't go as far as having followers kill themselves or others.\n\n\nand blindness is absolutely a symptom of Occipital Lobe Seizures.\n\n\nwhat I find really weird of people looking back at people in biblical times and going \"no way someone would try and lie, or people would follow a crazy person, etc... is there's tons of modern examples of blatent large cults with tons of followers, that you would say the leader is either crazy, or a con-artist, or possibly even a combination of them. But back in the biblical times where there's even less (no video evidence and little documentation to detect contradictions, pretty much zero knowledge of brain conditions, or really much anything related to health of any kind. I mean it's pre-germ theory day, so... effectively an experienced trained doctor... knows less about medicine than a typical first world 10 year old today.",

Even if not, as far as I remember, the blindness is only registered on acts, and is debatable if acts was actually written by luke. If so it is still dubious considering the author's record on portraying the disciples, especially Paul. He would also need to get this information at least second hand and recall it years latter. This would also explain why he tells the story twice in different ways. Paul's conversion story is also not a cornerstone of faith as apologists try to make it out to be, for me at least.",

You don’t have a radical life change from an epileptic seizure which he would’ve likely had before.

Maybe you need to work on the difference between assumptions and actual text.\n\nOne the problems in discussing Paul's epistles with an apologist like yourself is your tendency to backfill material from the gospels into Paul's epistles. It's natural to assume that Paul drops historical-Jesus breadcrumbs into his epistles from time to time, but the fact is that he doesn't. For example, at no point did Paul anticipate Mark's gospel by writing that the apostles Peter and James had been Jesus' companions in Galilee.\n\nDid you see my partial list of the historical/gospel terms that Paul omitted from his epistles? It includes such insignificant items as Pontius Pilate, Mary, Joseph, Herod, Bethlehem, Judas, Gethsemane and many, many more. He never once attributed a teaching to Jesus by name.\n\nOne might be tempted to think that Paul didn't include events like Jesus overturning the moneychangers' tables at the Temple and his miraculous feedings of thousands because he didn't think they were important.\n\nOn the other hand, a skeptic might wonder if  Paul left out those events because the author of Mark's gospel hadn't invented them yet!\n\nAs far as can be determined from Christian and secular literature from the period, NOBODY knew about these purportedly historical events until the 70s, when the anonymous author of the Markan gospel finally wrote it all down.

I lost count how many times I had to write this on this post, so when I said twelve, it was a slip, I probably meant \"the apostles\".\n\nIf they are the twelve of the gospels, that's is something he assumes his audience already knows, he even tries to compare himself to them, which are, for implicit reasons, trustworthy to his audience.\n\nPaul is not interested in recording history, so things like, Pontius Pilate or something Jesus did are not his main concern. He probably doesn't even know about many specific details about the life of Jesus.\n\nPaul doesn't talk about a grandiose event like the feedings of hundreds, the ascension to heaven, the virgin birth, the empty tomb and all of the other, for one simple reason. They didn't happen.\n\nI'm not an apologist (In that sense). I know that the whole old testament is false and only tangentially relates historical information. I know the gospels were written by people forgotten by history somewhere in Rome, maybe with the exception of Luke/acts but it doesn't make it more reliable. I know that James, Jude, Peter and John didn't write any books and only seven of Paul's letters are reliably attributed to him.\n\nThe thing is, Mark is fiction, but it doesn't mean it doesn't convey any historical details. The pillars of the church were not necessarily the ones the legends were told about twenty years latter, but I do think they probably are, given how much they fit the bill. But this inevitably goes back to if Jesus existed or not. Also, I think it is the simplest scenario. And Paul does quote from Jesus, to begin with, he attributes everything he says to Jesus, but he quotes him specifically on 1 cor 11:23-26:\n\n\" For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, “This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.” In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.”  For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.\"\n\nAs a side note, in case you are wondering, I'm not an atheist because of the pauline letters. I would prefer to be tough. But I know the bible is not the word of God.",

He quotes Jesus only once, at the Lord's Supper, (not the \"Last Supper\"), which bears a remarkable resemblance to the sacred feasts held by the mystery religions. Other than that, silence, even when a quote or attribution would support Paul in his disputes with the Jerusalem \"pillars,\" who, by the way, he does not describe as Jesus' companions in Galilee and Jerusalem.",

It doesn’t matter what evidence is presented you’ll deny it. The question was asked what are the names of the witnesses and do we here from them. Homer’s Odyssey is at least 1000 years from the original and accepted as the correct poem handed down. For you to accept the Bible the only evidence you will you accept is a personal miracle from God Himself which you would deny anyways. Put the same level of scrutiny for you to accept evolution as fact to the Bible and you would have to say it’s true considering all the evidence your willing to accept that is just guesses hearsay and conjecture. If the only level of evidence that you will accept is a personal physical supernatural miracles then say it. Otherwise all ancient historians and all evidence of them is just as false as you claim Josephus and others to be. You don’t offer any reasoning as to why they are not accepted. You just make a claim that they are not historians or trustworthy because they are writing about a subject you disagree with. Where is your evidence the 500 didn’t exist, in any ancient literature? You have no proof while we have several documents which are less than 125 years away from the original. We also have the Dead Sea scrolls which wipes out your argument about being generations fro the original. When put up to a modern Bible the Dead Sea scrolls are the same book and they weren’t discovered until 2000 years after they were written. With that evidence as fact we should be able to rely on the New Testament scriptures being only a generation away from original sources. What evidence do you have that they were changed? You offer none.",

Most archeologist have an agenda and you can see this if you watch all three seasons of Simcha Jacobvici’s Archeology show. I don’t remember the name. As many as you say don’t agree there are probably twice as many that do. So that is not real evidence. That’s a made up source. Josephus is a source outside the Bible. The different books of the Bible are also different sources, it’s not one person that I several. The question was where are the 500, they are found all over the New Testament.\nI’m done speaking and I’m figuratively shaking the dust off my sandals, as you have admitted even a miracle wouldn’t suffice. No amount of evidence. You’re saying you will only accept atheist evidence as a source. That’s a fallacy. Evidence is evidence. If a miracle won’t do it, how backward of a statement is that you will only accept a fact if someone who doesn’t agree with it fundamentally says it’s a fact.\nThat’s like asking a racist why they love black people. They don’t, they have an agenda. You have an agenda. There is no arguing and as you have said even a miracle isn’t enough to overcome your agenda.  No amount of facts can change someone’s mind if they are committed to being obstinate. Then trying to rebuke me like you e said anything that was halfway intelligent. That has to be the worst argument ever, that you wouldn’t even accept your own eyewitness as evidence. Then why ask for the evidence? You want to get on here and hate your neighbor.

Your only response is to accuse us of bad faith and obstinacy.\n\nDo you really think that's an intellectually honest and convincing argument?\n\nThe four canonical gospels are our ONLY contemporaneous source of biographical information about Jesus of Nazareth. (We do not have the original manuscripts. We only have nth generation copies.)\n\nAll - ALL - other writings about the historical Jesus are based on those anonymously written gospels, two of which are based on the first, the Gospel According to Mark, written no earlier than 70 AD. The Gospel of John, written near the end of the century, is also based on Mark, but to a lesser degree than Matthew & Luke. Paul did not write about Jesus' life. Nor did Jesus' relatives or the \"Twelve Apostles,\" purportedly the men who followed him in Galilee.\n\nExcept for the gospels, we have no contemporaneous (4 BC - 94 AD) accounts of Jesus of Nazareth's earthly ministry.\n\nJosephus is not a direct, independent or contemporaneous source. Born in 37 AD, he had no eyewitness knowledge of Jesus. He did not claim to have interviewed anyone who attested to the historical accuracy of the gospels. Nor did he claim to have seen official Roman or Jewish records regarding Jesus. With the exception of two brief passages of highly dubious authenticity, Josephus' writings reveal no familiarity with the lives of Jesus or his disciples.\n\nBy the time Josephus wrote the Jewish Antiquities , the Christian version of the story of Jesus was in wide circulation. So even if they were authentically Josephan, he could have heard them anywhere.",

Again, not sure if you are aware that the Apostle Mark didn't write the Gospel that is contained in the New Testament.\n\n>Luke\n\nThe Physician Luke who was not one of the 12 apostles that may have been one of the 72 disciples appointed by Jesus, according to the Gospel of Luke 10 oh, probably was not the person that wrote that book. We don't know who the author of Luke is for sure. Certainly whoever the author of The Gospel of Luke was does not seem to be an eyewitness though, nor does the author of the book of Luke claim to be such.\n\n>John\n\nAgain, this is kind of worrisome that you don't seem to be aware of this, but the Gospel of John wasn't written by the Apostle John. It seems like you don't know some basic things about the authorship of the Bible which is not a good start.\n\n>Mary Magdalene,\n\nOh dear, do you really not know that we have nothing written by Mary Magdalene? Or the other Mary you mention?\n\nAre you being for real? Do you really think Peter was written by the Apostle Peter? We don't have anything written by any of the original 12 Apostles.",

This sentence doesn't make any sense.\n\nAtw you attempting to suggest that there is evidence that substantiates some argument that you have some letter or book written by Mary Magdelene?\n\nYou would first need to substantiate that you know of something written first-hand by Mary Magdelene.\n\nIn the same way, a Muslim might say that Muhammad split the moon in two, and then I'd say there's no substantiated evidence for that. Now, the Muslim may then get all offended and form a poorly-worded sentence like \"prove Muhammad didn't split the moon using the amount of evidence you require if me\", but of course that would just show how deeply confused the person was.\n\n>You can’t.\n\nIf your asking for evidence that substantiates the idea that we don't have any first hand documents by Mary Magdelene, then I have lots. Let's see... are there any documents claiming to be her written by her own hand? Nope. Or in Aramaic claiming to be written by her? Nope. How about Peter... let's see... also nope. How about Andrew... also nope. How about Barthomenew... nope. How about Mark.... also nope.\n\nSo yes, I can.\n\n>You’re just guessing\n\nNo, I'm not. So for example, Peter almost certainly couldn't write. First of all, that makes sense because he was a fisherman, but also if you believe the new Testament, it makes sense that he can't write because the new Testament says he can't write. So Peter isn't written by Peter. Also, we don't have anything written claiming to be by him in his language, Aramaic.\n\nSo no, I'm not guessing.\n\nIn the same way I am not guessing when I say to a Muslim that there's no evidence that substantiates that Muhammad split the moon in two. They may get offended and act like I can't give any evidence that Muhammad didn't split the moon in two, or claim that I'm guessing that he didn't split the moon, but it would just show how embarrassingly ignorant that person is.\n\n>Prove Peter didn’t write it\n\nBahahahaha\n\nYou're not good at this arguing thing are you\n\nOkay, show me anything written in Aramaic claiming to be written by Peter. Or, show me how Peter could write 1st or 2nd Peter when it says that Peter couldn't write. Or show me some evidence that substantiates that it was written by Peter in any conceivable way.\n\n>What evidence do you have\n\nWell, not having anything written in the language Peter spoke is a big one. Also the text of 1 Peter calls the Roman's \"Babylon\", which only would make sense if he lived to 70CE when the Roman's destroyed the temple in Jerusalem as the Babylonians had done.\n\n>You’re making assumptions that I reject.\n\nYou don't seem particularly well educated in ancient texts or the historicity biblical authorship. Almost certainly you do not know what assumptions I am making because I didn't describe them in my earlier post, so my guess is your just saying you reject them because you are offended and metaphorically scowling and crossing your arms because you don't have a background in textual analysis.\n\nAt any rate, no, you are incorrect when you act like the evidence is split on these claims of yours.",

I know that Paul didn’t hang out with Jesus, but he did spend time with Peter.  One of the biggest problems that many people have with Christianity is the lack of first hand testimony.  We have 2nd and 3rd hand testimony from anonymous writers 40 years after the resurrection.\n\nWith Paul, we could have had first hand testimony from Peter, written within a few years of the crucifixion, and a known author.  Even in his letters, Paul makes no mention of any details of Jesus life, birth, miracles, etc….Absolutely zilch, nada,…Again, you a brilliant writer, you spend time with somebody who traveled around with god for 3 years, and you for some reason write nothing about it.  That just blows my mind.\n\nWhy didn’t an Omniscient all knowing God have somebody write his story.  So many people have issues with the fact that gospels are written so much later by anonymous Greek writers, most likely a 1000 miles or more away from where the actual events occurred.  Why didn’t Jesus tell Paul to tell his story during his conversion?  Instead of a throw away,  thinly supported reference to 500 witnesses, Paul could have interviewed other first hand witnesses and given names and sources.  You are correct in saying I don’t know what evidence I would require, but the fact that Paul says nothing like, “According to Peter”, “Peter informed me that”, “Peter said, is just so bizarre.",
