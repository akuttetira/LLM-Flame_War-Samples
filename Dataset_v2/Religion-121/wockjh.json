I think you might be ingesting too much newsmax.\n\n>As someone who is both an atheist and against government I find it odd when people skeptical of religious authority demand secular authority via the state\n\nInteresting.  You're signaling to being an atheist conservative I guess (rare breed), but you're also just making a lot of assumptions about people, especially with regards to state politics.  You're conflating political secularism with secular activism.  American liberals are all sorts of beliefs, but obviously many are also religious.  As much I'd love to believe that liberalism = atheism, it doesn't.\n\n>They trade in bishops, priests, and pastors, in exchange for bureaucrats, law enforcement agencies, and politicians.\n\nYou're engaging in a black/white worldview of political rhetoric if you even remotely believe this statement is true.  If you believe this statement is true, you're a simple-ton, incapable of understanding complexities of individual's opinions.  If you REALLY believe that's true, you deserve to be laughed at.\n\n>Specifically those who rave about the corruption of the police and then on the flip side demand the disarming of American civilians and the prohibition of self defense, for example.\n\nOK, well this says everything.  Neverminding your obviously incredible bias on what news you're ingesting on the regular, there's a complete warped sense of reality here.  No one is prohibiting self defense.  You're contributing to obvious lies.  Your words are fucking ridiculous.",

I'm against the military industrial complex. Voted third party in 2020 because I can't stand Trump or the average Republican politician. I just find gun control, universal healthcare, etc. To be abhorrent. I'd rather not be disarmed with my health being left to people that have murdered millions.\n\nWhen I said I'm against government, that's what I meant. I didn't mean I'm against Democratic Party controlled government.\n\nSure many American liberals claim to be religious. How many of those people actually adhere to a somewhat consistent religious practice is the real question to me. If you are a Catholic, and you vote for politicians who are pro-choice, the Catholic Church will be the first to tell you that you are not in line with their teaching and can really not call yourself a Catholic who is in good standing with the Church.\n\nI don't really ingest news. Certainly not overly conservative outlets like Newsmax or Brietbart. Along with your other assumptions, this was a bad one.\n\nSelf defense is criminalized in some parts of America. Firstly, if you defend yourself against the police there will be hell to pay. A good example of this is the Breonna Taylor case. Her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired at police when they invaded his home. He would have been charged had it not been for public outcry.\n\nAnother case recently involved a Bodega worker in New York. He killed someone who was trying to cause him bodily harm. He was arrested and the DA only dropped charges on the man for defending himself once public pressure mounted.\n\nA branch of the criminalization of self defense came to light with the SCOTUS Bruen decision recently. It was determined in this case that states and localities could not make individuals have a stated purpose for needing to conceal carry a firearm and that licenses should be issued to people who fulfill basic requirements, such as not having a criminal record and being of age. The reason this matters is that many localities and even some states entirely, had conceal carry laws so restrictive  and corrupted that you could only obtain CCW permits if you had connections to the right people. This criminalized self defense for many who could not obtain the license to carry a firearm legally and risked legal trouble for attempting to carry a weapon.",

You're libertarian (AKA \"Conservative-lite\")  The \"abhorrence\" of the ideas you mentioned are only abhorrent to people who ingest pretty wild propaganda, so you're flat out lying when you say you don't really ingest news. The obsession with CCW is based solely on conservative/libertarian media.  It's not at all the hyperbolic dilemma you're framing it to be.\n\nFrankly, I'm on the side of CCW being difficult to obtain.  I might change my mind if guns ever require proper training and licensing to own and operate, but until then, I don't support the general populous wandering around with deadly weapons in their pockets.  I grew up in the south, and would constantly have to leave house parties in high school because drunk assholes wanted to play with their fucking guns.  No surprise that they were pulled out during arguments, too.  Gun control isn't abhorrent. People are generally idiots.  Common sense gun control helps everyone.  It helps idiots make less mistakes, and can save lives.\n\nRegarding the bodega dude, that's a pretty random and complicated event to cite for your cause.  Did you see the video?  He honestly did not need to stab the dude to death.  My feelings are pretty ambivalent towards it, but it is by no means a shining example of some kind of repressive criminalization of self defense.  The guy was an asshole, but he wasn't armed, and he got stabbed to death in the heart.  You chose probably the worst example to try to make a point with.\n\nHot takes like \"The god of the American liberal tends to be the state\" is better placed on a post in /r/conservative.

The legalization of drugs, sex work, the abolition of the military industrial complex, etc. Just to name a few. We don't support police like conservatives do either.\n\nThird party votes are not throwing in the garbage. Anybody who has taken a basic political science course could tell you that historically and in the modern day, minor political parties play a role in the American electoral system.\n\nGun control has historically been used as a way to disarm minorities and political dissidents. The 1964 Mulford Act in California was a bipartisan piece of gun control used to attack the Black Panthers. Additionally the Native Americans were oftentimes disarmed and slaughtered. The Jews in World War 2 were also not allowed the right to possess weapons.\n\nIf someone makes the choice to try and kill you, they have forfeited any right to keep their life. Even if you think the Bodega example is bad, you failed to address the example of Kenneth Walker, or the fact that in many states and cities CCW permits were unavailable to anyone who didn't know someone in some way. Which I'm sure you could guess, has the most effect on low income people who are going to be less likely to have a professional connection.\n\nThe conservative subreddit is a cesspool as much as any liberal subreddit. I never praised conservatives. The original post doesn't belong in this sub, and yet it's here.\n\nBut I will defend that statement. Anyone who begs the government to take their weaponry, establish nationalized monopolies, and implement a myriad of other social spending programs and regulations, is trusting in the state as a christian would trust in their church.

All this over-generalized hyperbole sounds like it came straight from the desk of a top mind like Matt Geatz.  You're not being remotely intellectually honest.\n\nAlmost every law in America has racist origins, but with regards to Kenneth Walker, that was clearly more about bad police practices (no-knock warrants shouldn't be legal), and systemic racism inherent in the justice system.  If it was a white dude, it's very likely there wouldn't be a story.  Not interested in debating CCW, as I don't really care for or about it.\n\nYour original statement isn't worthy of defense.  It was insanely ignorant, yet unsurprising coming from a libertarian.  All libertarians I know personally have this funny way of broadcasting their unpopular opinions, and making it a point to be known just how pro-gun, anti-government, pro-capitalism, etc. they are, while taking every opportunity to shit on democrats. They're like vegans who can't shut up about being vegan, but with an insatiable added urge to be jackasses to people outside of their narrow worldview.
