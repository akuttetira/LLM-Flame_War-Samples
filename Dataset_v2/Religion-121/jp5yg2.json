She was also extremely flirty with him throughout the interview, touching him constantly, telling him he’s her hero etc. iirc, she’s the one who asked him into the bedroom too. I found it far less disturbing that he is responding to her apparent attraction (and massive age difference) than that they got access to him so easily. I even kind of buy that he was tucking his shirt in. She HAD just removed his microphone and done something to his shirt. It’s far easier to tuck back in laying down if you have a gut.\n\nI’m no fan of the man, but apart from her being younger I don’t see any huge sexual misconduct. The actress is of age, and as far as I could tell, he was never told otherwise. She was fawning over him. Takes a much better man than he is to not react to that. I mean he’s old and ugly and a beautiful 20-something is giving him that kind of attention...",

Cities won't invest bc low income housing has \"issues\" and rezoning is expensive.\n\nHomelessness is also expensive for a city. Build some homes where five blocks of unused warehouses have been sitting for the last two decades for fox sake. Throw in a park and a school too.",

Environmental surveys need to be done to ensure that the warehouses and businesses haven’t leeched chemicals into the soil. Infrastructure has to be reviewed, because now you have demand for water/sewer/ electric/gas for 5,000 homes instead of shared office spaces, which don’t require private water and sewer hookups, private bathrooms, 24 hour heating/cooling. Residential roads and sidewalks have different needs, and traffic pattern changes could affect nearby roadways. Residential zoning may require more green space, so parks and boulevards have to be installed.\n\nEvery step of the process requires a contract with inspectors or engineers or contractors. Manpower from government offices has to be taken into account. Lawyers will be involved. Costs can skyrocket pretty quickly.",

You think they're open and honest about how much income they generate as a church and where that income all goes?\n\nIt's not charity. It's a business with a purpose. They've done this for thousands of years - they know the way to more money. They're not stupid in that aspect.\n\nIs it really charity if conversion and more income is the endgame? Doesn't seem very altruistic to me.\n\nIf you want your tax dollars to go to feeding people, maybe it's time to start writing your local representatives and push to increase funding for shelters and food banks? Or you can skip the tax route and simply donate directly. Then you know exactly where your money is going and what it's doing.",

I've been to more than a dozen churches in my life and do you know what their recruitment method is? \"Hey we have a meal every Wednesday night and every Sunday morning. We'd love to have you and your family over. We appreciate donations but if you can't pay thats ok, too. You'll just have to endure sitting in a big room with some churchy things on the walls and maybe a prayer at the beginning of the meal.\" Like it or not, majority of smaller churches that do this kind of community outreach aren't scumbags looking for a payday. They're just nice folks",

You honestly think if everyone stopped paying it would still exist? I've been to so many different churches, big and small. I've seen multiple instances of the donation baskets being passed around twice. I've heard church leaders encouraging parishioners to donate more... More than they can afford because God will make sure their needs are met but the church needs money NOW. The greed and hypocrisy is amazing.\n\nI am jaded, yes. Churches are an abomination as far as community goes. Their purposes for the community could easily be met with a secular community center where everyone is welcome and no one has to deal with \"a few churchy things and maybe a prayer.\" No one should have religion forced on them. How priveleged you are if you've never felt that discomfort and feeling of not belonging in a community because you don't adhere to their specific brand of sky daddy.",
