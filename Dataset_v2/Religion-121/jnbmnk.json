It is a little long, but John Roberts is an extremely good legal writer and he sets it all out.\n\nThe government can't stop a corporation from buying time on a TV station to air a movie critical of Hillary Clinton. Sounds like a correct interpretation of the First Amendment? It is. But it has had ramifications that go far beyond.\n\nCorporate personhood?\n\nCorporations have always had different levels of personhood in different areas. That is what their name comes from. Corpus. Body. Person. Different under law than a human being, \"person\" is a term of art.\n\nThat is the point. An organization that people can control and raise funds for without risking their homes and families, or simply manage without running that personal risk. For-profit or non-profit. Public or private.\n\nIf you were on the board of your local symphony and the violinist messed up and her bow wound up sticking out of someone's eye? That's not your responsibility and it shouldn't  be and nobody would serve on the board of anything if stuff worked like that.\n\nLegal non-human persons are everywhere.",

However, I agree with you that this year will probably be different given the circumstances\n\nFrom the article I linked:\n\nThey found that in presidential and midterm general elections between 1996 and 2018, switching to all-mail voting increased the percentage of residents who voted by 1.8% to 2.9%, they report today in Science Advances. **When it came to the Democratic share of the vote, they found a tiny uptick in the share of votes that went to Democratic candidates for Congress, governor, and president—approximately 0.7%.** But the difference was so small that the margin of statistical error means it’s possible there was no effect at all, Holbein says.\n\nThe new results mirror work published in June by researchers from Stanford University. In that study, scientists looked for changes in voting as counties in Washington, Utah, and California gradually switched to all-mail ballots in 2006, 2012, and 2018. **They found a negligible partisan impact, with turnout by registered Democrats increasing by just 0.1% relative to Republicans**, they reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nhttps://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/08/do-republicans-or-democrats-benefit-mail-voting-it-turns-out-neither",

They can’t be outright racist anymore so they have to use different terms that accomplish the same goal. Everyone knows what the effects of purging voter rolls is and who it affects more but they legitimize it by pointing to one instance where fraud happened. It’s the same for everything they do. The reason they say they do something is just a way to legitimize how they want to oppress someone or benefit their donors instead of their constituents.",
