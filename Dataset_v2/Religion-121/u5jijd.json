    "Post_Title": "If Christianity were true, atheists would be the ones experiencing visions of god and witnessing miracles, not Christians",
    "post_text ": "The Christian god wouldn't waste his time with believers for the simple reason they're already saved. Instead, he'd focus on atheists because they're most in need of salvation. This is because \"God ... wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth\" (1 Tim. 2:3-4). Since its inception, Christianity has been a proselytizing religion. The necessity of proselytism is one of the core beliefs of mainstream Christianity. There is already precedent for the use of the miraculous to bring about conversion of unbelievers in the New Testament i.e. the conversion of Saul of Tarsus (Acts 9:1-9). So why wouldn't god prioritize atheists over Christians in terms of witnessing miracles, experiencing visions and divine revelations etc? \n\nBecause \"God ... wants all people to be saved,\" he would have, for example, atheists witness miracles that couldn't be explained as anything else except miracles, so that atheists would have no choice except to convert to Christianity. This means god, if he existed, and was as all-powerful as Christians say he is, would provide atheists with evidence convincing enough to convert them to the supposedly one true faith. \n\nPut another way, in his zeal to save mankind, *god would eliminate atheism simply by providing this irrefutable evidence in the form of real miracles etc, making it impossible for atheists to remain atheists.*\n\nYet only believers have visions and witness miracles, not the atheists most in need of salvation. Which means that atheism still exists. This isn't what you'd expect if Christianity were true.",

There is no one who seeks god.\n\nAs in Matthew 7, where even people who think they are Christians come before him in the last day declaring the works, and he never knew them.\n\nOr when the seven sons of sceva, Jews in the book of Acts who try to cast out demons in the name of \"this Jesus that Paul preaches\". The demons say Jesus we know and Paul we know, but who are you? Then the demons beat them senseless and strip them naked.\n\nThat would be the same for the atheist. God doesn't even know or care who they are. He never needs to \"prove\" himself to anyone.",

The steady state model was the popular one at one point in the 20th century. They ridiculed rejected and mocked the big bang, and then of course we know what happened.\n\nWhen a person divorces someone they despise and move 5,000 miles away and never talk to them again, do they continue to know them?\n\nWhen someone leaves your area and says it's been nice knowing you, what do they mean?\n\nIf biblically, a man knows a woman, what do you think that means?\n\nDoes a blind person know what you look like? Does a deaf person know what a symphony sounds like?\n\nMy arguments are Genesis 1 to Revelations 22. It makes it clear that unbelievers are completely incapable of understanding it, so anything I say cannot convince an unbeliever. By design and their separation from God and their own\n\nIt is not my job to do anything other than to defend the gospel. Many are called but few are chosen. Only the chosen, at the time of God's choosing such as the apostle Paul or the thief in the cross who cursed and then defended jesus, will ever truly understand what I say.\n\nI was an Evangelical before I was a calvinist. They thought their job just try to save anybody and everybody. But the reality is, that witnessing about the gospel is to awaken those who were in The Book of Life since the foundation of the world.\n\nThe unbeliever will offer up a variety of rebellions, such as I am a skeptic or atheist or I choose this or that religion. They lay a host of charges on God such as he is misogynist or he condone slavery or this or that Injustice which frankly is actually usually perpetrated by people.\n\nAnd then when the final judgment comes, this rebellious one is standing before God without representation, AKA price, and all that anger suddenly becomes dread and then hopelessness. Because again as I said, he never knew them. Matthew 7: 21-25 ish.\n\nI was an atheist for years, but compared to what I am now (as the song says), it was just a drop of water in an endless sea.\n\nI know from where I came and where I am going and why I am here.\n\nThe evidence of the Old and New testaments are overwhelming. All I ever get back when debating atheists or skeptics is trivialities and conjecture and beliefs and anger. They never have anything of their own offer. Because of course you cannot disprove god, because you have to disprove him anywhere. Since they never have any evidence, they just want to discuss mine. I usually find a giant waste of time because they are like a two-year-old who discovered the word and love to use it by saying  NO in a loud voice\n\nAnd of course you will try to pick holes in the above, but the sad thing is you will be incapable of hearing or learning or understanding unless you are the one in a thousand.",

I have this issue with some theists where they demand evidence that he isnt there. It's a classic shifting of the burden. They also demand an alternative explanation. The burden is on you, you are making the claim, I am making no claim. You are uncomfortable admitting that you dont know. If somebody cant prove something, they can surmise all they want, but thats not proof. The convincing is on you. And if you cant prove god exists, then just accept that. People arent wrong or foolish for believing in something with no evidence. Thats just people using their heads. You strawman by making it seem like they are being stubborn children, when in actuality they are being mature and using their critical thinking skills. Again, nobody has to prove that god doesnt exist, they arent the ones making claims. The one who is claiming they exist is the one making the claim. Prove it. You cant. There is no overwhelming evidence.  It doesnt meet any burden of proof, it's just specious logic. there is no hard evidence, and there probably wont be at least not for now, and thats ok. It's ok not to know something.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNobody is calling god (that you cant prove they even exist) a misogynist or anything, you're right, those are people (again because you can prove people exist but not god). All of the horrible things in the bible were perpetrated by people. But those same people THINK that god commanded and or did those things because they are all good and loving and everything they do is right, and you have to do what god says and follow what him and his son teach, even though there's no proof of any of it. You mention science, and yeah science gets it wrong because PEOPLE get it wrong. Science has mechanisms for correcting itself.
