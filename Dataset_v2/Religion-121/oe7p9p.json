    "post_text ": "Christians claim that the Bible is God’s message to humanity. Assuming that God is supposed to be really smart and really powerful, God could have created a much better book. For one thing, it could contain lots of scientific insight that humans could not have known back then. For another, it could have provided logical explanations for why certain moral requirements are in place.\n\nGod, being a god, could have written a book that would convince nearly everyone.\n\nSo, either the Bible is not divinely inspired or it is deliberately written to be somewhat unconvincing.\n\nThat leads to the uncomfortable question of why God would choose to deceive people through poor communication.\n\nAll of the answers to this question describe a God who wants to withhold information. That is inconsistent with having rules or expectations about people’s behaviors to avoid damnation.\n\nIt is morally inconsistent to communicate requirements for avoiding Hell in an unconvincing manner. \n\nProviding full information, delivered convincingly, would not abrogate my free will.",
