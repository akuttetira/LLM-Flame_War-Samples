    "Post_Title": "The vampire standard, or why there can be no compelling empirical evidence for theism",
    "post_text ": "In 1735, a team of five Austrio-Hungarian military officers, among them a doctor and two surgeons, attended the Serbian village of  Medvegia to investigate reports of a vampire infestation. The team interviewed the villagers and dissected the corpses exhumed suspicious graves, confirming 13 cases of vampirism. Their findings are published in [the Fluckinger Report](https://web.archive.org/web/20060315125133/http://www.vampgirl.com/visum.html).\n\nThe report was not an isolated event - Roseau went on to comment:\n\n>If there is a well-attested history in the world, it is that of the Vampires. Nothing is missing from it: interrogations, certifications by Notables, Surgeons, Parish Priests, Magistrates. The judicial proof is one of the most complete. And with all that, who believes in Vampires? Will we all be damned for not having believed?\n\nObviously very few people are going to find this report compelling evidence of vampires. It might seem unlikely that a team of doctors and military officers misidentified signs of decomposition, that trained professionals of all types throughout Europe were caught up in a vampire craze for decades... and yet, any such unlikely explanation will always be more likely than the possibility of vampires having existed.\n\nThe analogy I am getting to is obvious. From time to time we see theists refer to historical or witness evidence of their religion's supernatural events. \"How could Paul lie about all those witnesses when he was talking about events in living memory\". \"Why would the disciples have been martyred for a lie?\". If we apply the vampire standard to these supernatural events, we realise not only is the historical evidence not compelling, it *cannot* be compelling - the bar for proving supernatural claims is just so high that we cannot reasonably expect achieve it through historical evidence.\n\nThere is one kind of empirical evidence which would meet the bar - scientific evidence. If we could repeatedly and reliably test for miracles, we would have no choice but to accept them. But I am yet to meet a theist who considers that we can scientifically test for miracles. The Bible outright states \"you shall not test the Lord thy God\". So the only branch of empiricism capable of adequately evidencing supernatural claims is ruled out.",

Even if we believe that every question can be answered, some of the answers are very difficult to find. \"Having faith\" is to be able to put your ego aside and trust this system as a whole, rather then trust only your own reasoning in a given situation.

The more you understand these positive aspects of your religion, the more you trust it. This trust is a conclusion - it's not blind. That's also why it wouldn't make sense to give your religion up immediately if some of the questions that relate to it are difficult to answer.\n\nThat's why I gave this\n\n>very non-standard definition of faith which is basically focused on outcomes\n\nThe religions that people believe in are the ones that promise/produce the best outcomes and are most credible. For example, you could claim that the animistic religions lost their popularity because the outcomes that they promised weren't attractive enough. On the other hand, weird sects also won't gain much popularity because they lack credibility, so they are unlikely to produce the outcomes they promise.\n\nSo there is always a sort of economy of faith. It's always rational, at least to a certain degree. Of course, there are also cases when a religion is a self-deception. But it's in everyone's best interest to discern whether this is the case or not.",

That’s not how reality works.\n\nThat's exactly how it works. The religion is a very complex problem. It's impossible to completely, analitically verify whether your belief is true or not. It's also impossible to entirely understand it in ones lifetime. That's why you can only estimate whether it's true or not - based on your own reasoning, observed results, input from other people etc.\n\nThe example with the scammer is a bad one, because you do encounter real-life situations when you can only estimate the probability of something being true, and it is possible to solve this kind of problems in a reasonable way.",

You’re literally saying that the best way to come to conclusions about reality is not to examine different claims on a separate, discrete basis, trying to determine each claim’s veracity on its own merits alone, but to accept that all claims made from the same source are true if some of those claims are true.\n\nFollowing that principle will lead to very stupid conclusions. Say I have a book that says seven true things, and three false things—under your model, I ought to accept the whole book as true, not by examining the discrete claims within it but by determining some are true, and calling it good. That is *incredibly dumb*, and verges on being outright child-like in its reasoning.\n\nHere’s another example for you: the sky is blue, 1+1=2, and I’m the son of god.

Nevertheless, I'd say Catholicism is quite reasonable. It has a very good and refined theology, for example. It also approves critical reasoning as an important way of reaching the truth.",

For example, there is the fact that the Catholic’s authority is based on a single line of Jesus telling Peter that he would build his church on “this rock” Matthew 16:18.\n\nJesus did not specify “go to Rome to found this Church”, “Bishops of the Roman Church will have the ability to speak for me on matters of Faith”, or any of the specific authorities the Catholic Church/the pope specifically has claimed over the years.\n\nThe Church has also changed its rules on important things regarding how the institution works, specifically the Pope, who again has the rarely used power to speak on behalf of God so we need to know he is God’s choice. Early poles were (probably) elected by the local populace, then they were chosen by their predecessor, then back to local elections, then the Byzantine emperor de facto appointed the pope for awhile, then went back to elections with a side dose of “which ever papal candidate could convince the largest army to back them won the election” and “which ever person the area with the largest army would come in and put their own pope in power.” https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_selection_before_1059\n\nThe Cardinals did not start electing popes until 1059 (with the idea that God influences their votes to ensure the “correct” candidate takes power). Even after the Cardinals came into existence there were plenty of issues, such as the time Cardinals took almost three years to select a pope forcing the locals to lock them in and even remove the roof so the Cardinals would just get on with it (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1268–1271_papal_election), or the multiple times when groups of cardinals went out to elect their own pope outside of what the majority voted for, creating “antipopes”.\n\nThere is other insanity like the time a Pope’s corpse was put on trial (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver_Synod), the warrior Pope who went and conquered much of Italy (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Julius_II), the guy who was pope three times and tried to sell it (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Benedict_IX), and the “pornacracy” (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saeculum_obscurum).\n\nAll that is just the pope, not all the various bishops and priests who have served under the Church.\n\nIn short, the Catholic Church has endured, but has all the hallmarks of  a human institution run only by at times corrupt, insane, or otherwise deeply terrible men, rather than God’s institution who ensures only the best possible candidate makes their way to the papal seat.",

There’s never been a single scientifically confirmed supernatural event. It all relies on testimony which we know is the weakest form of evidence.\n\nYou also keep invoking “spiritual benefits” which isn’t evidence for the *truth* of your claim.
