    "Post_Title": "The Quran is clearly a man-made book and not from God.",
    "post_text ": "After gaining some holistic understanding of the context in which the Quran was revealed, learning about some of its history, the hadiths'/sira, and the history of early Muslims, and then subsequently reading its content, it becomes strikingly clear that it is of human origin. The Quran lacks any miraculous qualities, and it contains numerous scientific/logical errors and poorly written verses. \n\nMuslims question how could an illiterate man from a primitive desert known so much. However, it is not surprising that Mohamed, who was a merchant and traveled extensively, would encounter many educated Jews and Christians, along with knowing people from the neighbouring Byzantine and Sassinid empires, with their rich history and religions, both empires had established trade routes to Mecca at the time. He also had several very close companions who had extensive knowledge of other religions, like Suleiman el Farsi, who had studied both Zoroastrianism and Christianity.\n\nThe Quran isn't a miracle linguistically either. During the Jahilya \"pre-islam\" period, Arab poets created such exceptional works that their poetry is still studied and taught in schools today. There are even several similarities between some of this pre-islam poetry and Quranic verses. In the Quran it tells us that the people of Mecca thought he was a poet just like any other. There were also other \"prophets\" during Mohamed's time in other Arab tribes, like Musaylima who also recited his own verses and managed to gain 40,000 followers before being defeated by Muslims.\n\nFurthermore, despite Mohamed reciting Quran verses for **thirteen years** in Mecca, he had only a few conversions, mostly among his close family and companions. The Quran even states that people were questioning Mohamed to provide a miracle, so they clearly did not view the Quran as sufficient. It's only when Mohamed went to Medina, gained some man power and then took control of the trade route that so many neighbouring tribes start to convert to Islam, leading us to believe it was political, not because they thought the Quran was miraculous. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that our understanding of Mohamed is primarily based on Muslim sources that were written 150-200+ years after his passing. A lot of Information might have been fabricated or erased in his favour, but regardless we can still infer that the Quran was simply a product of its environment, rather than a completely unique and otherworldly miracle, which explains why it would contains so many errors, such as the following:\n\n**1. Flat Earth in Quran:**\n\nThe Earth is mentioned 461 times in the Quran and not a single time does the author explicitly say it is round. It's the opposite, the Quran constantly describes the Earth using words like satah سَطَحَ \"spread out flat\" or madad مدد \"extend out\" or farash فَرَشَْ \"spread out\".. so on, verses like 13:3, 2:22, 15:19, 20:53, 43:10,  50:7, 51:48, 71:19, 78:6-7,  79:30, 88:20 all directly describe Earth shape as flat, which makes sense considering where/when the Quran was written. \n\nMany other verses also indirectly indicate that the author thought it was flat, like ones that describe the sun setting in a spring (18:86), fasting and prayer time verses that are totally impracticable for people living near the poles (2:187), verse that says prayer should be towards Kabaah which is something that isn't really compatible with a round Earth (2:144).. etc. \n\nEven with such overwhelming evidence Muslims still somehow insist that the Quran intends to convey the Earth is round, which if true then it's still a massive quranic error that God is incapable of clearly expressing something that is not hard to say. Either way, it's an unavoidable error. \n\nRead more about Flat Earth in Quran here:\nhttps://wikiislam.net/wiki/Islamic_Views_on_the_Shape_of_the_Earth\n\n**2. Heart responsible for human reasoning & thinking, not the brain:**\n\nYeah it's a known figure of speech when someone says \"think with your heart\". The problem is that it's clearly not figurative but rather literal in the Quran, the author thought the heart organ is responsible for thinking. An error that would makes sense coming from a man made book, since that was a common myth back then.\n\n**\"Have they not travelled throughout the land so their hearts may reason, and their ears may listen? Indeed, it is not the eyes that are blind, but it is the hearts in the chests that grow blind.\"** [22:46](https://quran.com/en/al-hajj/46)\n\nThere are so many examples but this one is very clear, it gives context by saying \"ears may listen\", \"eyes that are blind\". Which means it's talking about actual biological function, it's not talking metaphorically when it says \"their heart may reason\".\n\nSo It's not figurative and the classic commentaries did not interpret it as a figurative expression, it's even more clear reading it in Arabic. Muslims still try to prove the heart is responsible for reasoning because of this verse and others like it, but obviously that's all nonsense since we can have artifical hearts nowadays.  \n\nAnd it's still a quranic error if Allah did not intend for the heart to be taken literally in this verse, because he could have written it in a much better and clear way. Why would God use such imprecise misleading language, implying ears are for hearing (literal), eyes are for seeing (literal) and heart is for reasoning (firguative) all in the same verse next to each other?\n\nSomeone posted here recently going way more in depth about this Error: https://redd.it/10jjgg9\n\n\n**3. The \"between backbone and the ribs\" verse:**\n\n**\"Let people then consider what they were created from! They were created from a spurting fluid, stemming from between the backbone and the ribs.\"** [86:5-7](https://quran.com/en/at-tariq/5-7)\n\nYeah I know most probably heard of this before so I'll keep it brief, the contention is that this \"spurting fluid\" is sperm therefore it's a scientific error because we know between backbone and the ribs is the wrong location, it's the testis. \n\nBut here's the kicker.. It doesn't matter. It's still a significant error even when \"spurting fluid\" doesn't necessarily mean sperm. The problem is that pretty much no one knows for sure and it's still up for debate, I've heard at least 4 different interpretations for \"spurting fluid\", some say it means seminal fluid, others say it's talking about the baby itself, so on. \n\nSo again, for the third time, why would God use such imprecise language and writing that he creates 3 verses that are essentially completely useless because no one knows for sure what he means. It's such a glaring issue I don't know how Muslims ignore it. \n\n___________\n\nIn conclusion, it is evident that the Quran is a human creation. Even without knowledge about it's historical context, there are numerous reasons to reject it other than ones already mentioned above, including its advocacy for eternal punishment for disbelief, its illogical \"bring something like it\" challenge, and its endorsement of child marriage. This write-up only scratches the surface of the Quran's falsehood, but it should suffice to demonstrate the issues at hand.",

Clearly the quran is from God. Ur just a goofy who hates muslims apparently noone would take time out of their day to bring falsehood to the quran literally all these points have been refuted^ the islamic scholars 1000 years ago were the first to say the earth was spherical because the quran made that apparent😂😭 yall are so lost lmao its sad",

Quran and Muslims aren't special in this.\n\nChristians also say Bible has scientific miracles. https://youtu.be/t2sMJMXDiH4\n\nAnd Hindus also say their scriptures have scientific miracles and fulfilled prophecies. https://youtu.be/YRieaQhNFu4\n\n>scientific miracles or predictions of the future like pharoah of moses king ramses\n\nHow about you take like 2 minutes before blindly regurgitating so called \"miracles\" like this one and actually look up replies to it that refute it, or can you not do any research at all?\n\n>Ur just a goofy who hates muslims apparently noone would take time out of their day to bring falsehood to the quran literally all these points have been refuted\n\nWhat is this logic?\nCriticising Islam = \"You hate Muslims\"??\nno dummy I don't hate Muslims, most of my friends are Muslims. Actually I feel bad for most of you because you have been deceived since birth to believe all of this. You're literally wasting your precious life away over fiction.\n\n>the islamic scholars 1000 years ago were the first to say the earth was spherical\n\nThis is by far one of the most idiotic statements I've ever heard, the Greek knew the earth was spherical over 2000 years ago and no, early Muslims didn't believe the earth was spherical, early scholars thought it was flat. Again, do some research before saying some dumb shit.\n\n>yall are so lost lmao its sad\n\nAre those who are lost, people who waste their lives In hopes they will enter a fictional heaven or those who are aware of the reality that there's no afterlife therefore we must make this one life the best it can possibly be?

For a verse to be considered a scientific miracle it has to meet 3 very important criterias, which are:\n\n1. The Knowledge didn't exist\n2. There’s no possible alternative meaning\n3. The statements are scientifically accurate\n\nThere's no scientific miracle claim in the Quran that meets all 3 criterias. For example, let's look at the first video you sent, again if you just did a little bit of research you'd learn that:\n\n1. Pulsars don't make sound. They emit waves in the EM spectrum, so the statement is scientifically inaccurate.\n2. The word *tariq* (the knocker) as another name for a star was in usage long before Islam. There's a pre-Islamic poem by a pagan priestess called Al Zabraa that uses that term, therefore it's not something unique to the Quran.\n\nDone.. it's not a miracle.\n\nAnd about the second video, again if you actually read my comment you'd understand that these scientists are not dumb but what they believe in is very silly, **smart people can believe silly things**. It's normal. Why? Because they're smart enough to rationalise silly ideas in their head to be able to convince themselves.\n\nWhat's so funny about this is that nowadays prominent Muslim scholars advice Muslims to stop using the scientific miracles arguments because they know it does more harm to Islam than good, if you start treating the Quran as a scientific book you'll run into so many problems. So Islamic Scholars stopped using these silly arguments years ago, but hilariously some Muslims still use it like yourself.",
