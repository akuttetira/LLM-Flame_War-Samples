    "Post_Title": "Over a period of almost 5000 years, Allah sent 25 prophets, of which only the 25th prophet successfully spread Islam/Allah's message. It took Allah, an omniscient and omnipotent being, 25 attempts to spread his message. A track-record like this would get you fired from McDonald's.",
    "post_text ": "Imagine if you are a recruiter at... well, any company, and you employ 24 people in a row who all fail to do their job. Do you think you would get fired?\n\nOf course you would. That is a terrible track-record and evidence for absolutely terrible judgement. It showcases a stunning lack of competence and anyone would deem you unfit for the task at hand.\n\nNow, imagine that this recruiter is omniscient. Suddenly, your inadequacy is no longer a sign of incompetence, but rather that of calculated and deliberate sabotage.\n\nYou can blame this on the free will of man kind. That humans have free will, bestowed upon them by Allah himself, and that they chose to reject Allah's message the first 24 times. But that is only moving the goalpost and ignores the supposition that Allah is omniscient.\n\nAllah is the prime mover in the event of prophethood. He is an active force. Even if we postulate that Gabriel, or some other being, finalized the recruitment of the prophet - Allah recruited the recruiter. The onus is always on Allah - because it is he who wants to spread his message. Allah, being omniscient, knew before initiating these events the exact outcome and yet he wasted his and our time sending 24 prophets who would all fail in spreading his word.\n\nThat speaks either of incompetence (i.e. Allah is not omniscient) or purposeful deception and sabotage.\n\nIt is inexcusable for an omniscient and omnipotent being to fail 24 times in a row and it requires further examination. This, as a muslim, should absolutely catalyze a journey of inquiry into the logic of the Quran because the only way to truly hand-wave this is by suspending your logic and appeal to the idea that \"God works in mysterious ways\".",

You only go to Hell if you know it's the correct religion but then ignore it. Does this apply to you?\n\nIf yes, then it's ignorance. If no, then you're going heaven mate, just be a good Samaritan :)",
