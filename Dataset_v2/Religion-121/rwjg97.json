    "post_text ": "Hey everyone, I’m not very big on complicated arguments, so I’ll keep it very simple: You can believe literally anything on faith. People believe all kinds of religions on faith. You can believe in any kind of supernatural claim, any kind of racist, sexist ideology purely on faith. Anything you can think of really. \n\nIf you can believe anything on faith, it is a useless tool when it comes to finding out any kind of truth, and people who care about believing as many true things and as few false things as possible should discard it.\n\nEdit: I really should have defined faith first. My bad. I define faith as belief without evidence.",

I've seen atheists making this mistake often.\n\nResearch the word \"pistis\" in the context of the New Testament. \"Pistis\" or faith is used as confidence or trust in something based on evidence. When i say i have faith that the bank won't steal my money i don't say i have blind faith. I have confidence that the bank is unlikely to do something like that. My confidence is based on evidence, prior experience, the experience of other peopl etc. Then i make a probability: it's really unlikely that the bank will steal my salary. I have faith in the bank.",

It means ‘trust’ or ‘confidence’ in someone or something, like eusuntjur said. Grab a dictionary. Look up the word, and see the primary definition.\n\nIf you want to change the primary/common definition of words to support your argument, add a premise and state that your argument depends on your secondary/uncommon  definition. Otherwise, you’d just be playing word games which make it impossible to use actual evidence to convince you of anything.\n\nFaith *can* be in things without evidence. But it also *can* be in things with evidence. Like any tool it can be used reasonably or unreasonably. So I can have faith that my dad will pick me up after school based on evidence that he will, and if the evidence is good the result is reliable. Or I can have faith that my dad will pick me up after school with no evidence that he intends to, and I may end up stranded.  In both cases I had faith. Only the reasonable faith was useful as far as being reasonably reliable to truly accomplish my goal. Even if random and unreasonable faith, pure guesses, might by chance also end up being eventually shown true sometimes, faith is only reliably useful, as a tool to accomplish something, when it is based on evidence.\n\n> Hebrews 11:1 Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.\n\nSure but don’t stop there. While at first glance that one verse taken out of context could seem to be promoting faith without evidence, the examples of this faith given in the chapter include people whom God spoke to. God apparently audibly evidenced himself (or itself) reliably enough for them to have faith. So even the figures held up in Hebrews 11 as examples of faith didn’t *necessarily* have a faith with no evidence, even if technically “blind” with regards to visible things. Even if they had no objective visible evidence to show someone else, if they had audible or other evidence they still had evidence through which they came to know God. And so they had faith based on *evidence* and based on *reason.*\n\n> This is how the New Testament defines faith.\n\nRipping passages out of context is a great way to play word games but it is a useless way to examine writings *if the goal is truth*, to find the truly intended meaning of a passage.\n\n> I don’t see it saying anything about evidence.\n\n… because you stopped reading before finishing the passage. You took half of the author’s thought being expressed which is a misleading thing to do when the entire thought contradicts your claim as to what the author meant.\n\n>  Quite the opposite.\n\nYes. Word games allow us to reach the opposite of the true conclusion no matter how much reasonable evidence we are presented. We can end up trolling others this way if we are doing it intentionally. We can also troll ourselves  this way… which may be even more worrisome. In other words we can unintentionally mislead ourselves by this sort of gamesmanship with passage contexts and word definitions until it is impossible for us to come to a rational conclusion nor to any conclusion besides the one we have made our goal.",

You’re referring to a secondary, less common definition, listed toward the bottom.\n\nSo faith can mean multiple things. This enables you to play word games, if you were to choose to do so. That would be unreasonable though. If you insist that we disregard the primary, most common definition of the word faith, you should put that in your argument as a premise. Otherwise a reasonable person will assume that when you say “faith” you’re referring to the primary, most common definition.\n\nFaith primarily means confidence. Confidence can be based on evidence. Confidence doesn’t *have* to be without evidence. So faith *can* be useful if it is based on evidence.\n\nFaith can also mean confidence without proof, which is a secondary definition. Therefore your OP’s conclusion is only correct if we rip the primary definition of the word “faith”\nout of our dictionaries and pretend only the least common definitions exist… an unreasonable thing to do. If we agree that the primary definition is also valid (which is reasonable), then faith does not have to be without evidence. Therefore, faith (according to the primary and most commonly used definition) *can* be useful.",

Don’t believe without evidence. When it comes to religious faith though, in spirits and what not, the evidence some people witness may not be available to everyone.  Similarly one person may have reason to believe in alien life, as unlikely as a personal encounter with an alien may seem to us collectively, and another may not. Each has to honestly process the evidence that has been made available to them personally, in addition to the evidence that is collectively  available to everyone.\n\nIOW with spirituality, there is no reason to necessarily assume that if spiritual beings or spiritual realities were experienced by someone it would then necessarily have to be the type of experience that everyone reasonable could necessarily experience at will if one person did, like radio waves or some other previously unknown physical phenomenon someone came to reasonably realize exists. Spiritual experiences, if real, don't necessarily have to be experiences that would be as evident and apparent to everyone as they were to someone else.",

The point is: the word faith is never used as \"beliving in something without evidence\". The word is used to describe confidence based on evidence. Maybe the evidence is not strong enough for you, that's a topic for another day. But to say \"faith is beliving without evidence\" is dishonest. That's not how the word is used in the NT.

I am genuinely trying to know what the truth is, and if there is evidence that isn't fallacious, I'll accept it.\n\n>Kalam Cosmological Argument, the Teleological Argument, The Moral Argument, The Fine-Tunning Argument, The Quantum God Argument, The Case For Free Will and other dozen of arguments put forward by apologists and philosophers over the years.\n\nAnd what evidence can you present to demonstrate that these arguments are sound?\n\nI'll take one example, the Kalam. The conclusion of the Kalam cosmological argument is \"therefore the universe had a cause\". Even if we accept Kalam in its entirety (which I don't because I think both premises are unfalsifiable) the conclusion is that the universe had a cause, not that god exists. The Kalam is not evidence of a god, since the word god is not contained in either premise or the conclusion.\n\nNow, most people when citing Kalam will then move on to Bill Craig's list of add ons: \"the cause\" must be timeless, spaceless, immaterial, powerful, and the most important one, personal. These are not part of the Kalam cosmological argument, these are Bill Craig's add ons, which need their own evidence. These are never actually justified, only asserted.\n\nOn top of that, an argument in and of itself isn't evidence. You have to demonstrate the premise is true.\n\nP1: if anything in the sky doesn't orbit the earth, then the earth is not the center of the universe.\n\nP2: there are 4 big moons orbiting the planet Jupiter.\n\nC: the earth is not the center of the universe.\n\nThis argument is NOT evidence that the earth is not the center of the universe. The argument alone is worthless until I can demonstrate the validity of the premise.\n\nNot until I pull out my telescope and SHOW YOU the Gallilian moons, a demonstration of the premise 2.\n\nWhere is your demonstration that everything that begins to exist has a cause on par with my pulling out my telescope and showing you Jupiter's moons?\n\n>After that, the reliability of the New Testament is very convincing to me. The old atheistic arguments that the gospels are written much later or they're just stories don't really hold up.\n\nIf I list 10 things and 9 of them are true, does that mean that the 10th thing is also true? No.\n\nSo while we can certainly say that some of the stories in the new testament are factual history, that tells us nothing about the miracle claims, that Jesus walked on water, spontaneously materialized bread and fish out of thin air, or rose from the dead, which are the only claims that are relevant.\n\nMuch of the Qu'ran is also historically reliable, in that many of the people, places and events they describe were in fact historical events. Does that mean the miracle claims of Muhammed splitting the moon in half or riding a horse in to the sky are true and that Islam is true? No, of course not. If a specific bit of evidence can be used to justify any position, rather than one specific position, then it isn't evidence.\n\n>There is a ton of evidence that the writter of the Gospels knew what they were talking about, not just inventing stories.\n\nWho wrote the gospels? As far as I'm aware, they are anonymous, and unsigned, and the names attributes to them are church tradition, not actual authorship.\n\n>Also, arguments like \" the gospels evolved\" or \"jesus never existed\" are not very convincing to me.\n\nI'm fine with a historical Jesus. I want to know if he was god incarnate.\n\n>It appears that the Gospels are biographies of a real historical person that had a following of people and was known as a miracle worker,\n\nI don't care about a historical Jesus. I'm fine with the idea that Jesus was a real person. How do you determine that he was an actual miracle worker?\n\n>died by crucifixion and people claimed he was alive again.\n\nPeople also claim to have seen Elvis after he died too. Does that mean Elvis rose from the dead?\n\n\n>Theories like: \"they were hallucinating\" or \"the apostles stole the body\" are weak\n\nHow about \"they truly believed in what they saw, but they were genuinely mistaken\". People can be wrong about stuff, can't they?\n\n\n>Also i find the conspiracy theory that Jesus never existed absurd. Almost all professionals and scholars in this field agree that Jesus was a real person.\n\nAgain, I'm fine with a historical Jesus.\n\n>I didn't try to make a huge post, just a brief summary of why i left atheism several years ago and turned Christian.\n\n**Why** were you an atheist?\n\n>The cumulative case is convincing to me,\n\nIt's not to me. Because everything you listed out here isn't evidence that Yahweh exists. Every single one is fallacious in one way or another.\n\n\n>and i believe a theistic wordview makes better sense than an atheistic one.\n\nAtheism isn't a worldview. It's one answer to one question. My worldview is methodological naturalism, ie, science. We have evidence that the natural world exists. We have no conclusive evidence that a deity exists.",

Grab a dictionary. Look up faith. Since you didn’t specify a secondary/uncommon definition for “faith” in your OP, it is reasonable to presume you meant the primary/common definition. If you meant something else, you need to say so in your premises.\nOtherwise you’d be being  unreasonable and merely playing word games… which is useless in debate *unless the goal is to troll.*\n\nThe primary definition is ‘confidence’ or ‘trust.’ Do you think people should have confidence in things they have no evidentiary reason to be confident in? No, of course they shouldn’t. So that’s why I said people should use faith (confidence) if they have evidence.\n\n> Can you demonstrate that and why anyone should use faith?\n\nI already did but in case you just accidentally missed it…  I can have faith that my dad will pick me up after school based on evidence that he will, and if the evidence is good the result is truly reliable. If evidence indicates my dad has been faithful to pick me up in the past, and he has assured me he will be again, then I should use my faith to rely on him for a ride this afternoon. Why? In order to get home, because the evidence I have indicates it is true that I reliably can get home this way.\n\nWe can also see why someone should not use the type of faith that is not based on evidence (which is a less common, secondary definition of the word faith). If I have faith that my dad will pick me up after school with no evidence that he intends to, my father having abandoned me when I was 3 years old and never having done anything to indicate he will pick me up, then I will likely end up stranded. In both cases I had faith. Only the faith based on evidence was useful.\n\n> What are the benefits in finding out what is true?\n\nReliability. Truth can be immensely helpful for someone who wants to reliably accomplish things.",

A reasonable person would assume you used the word faith to mean what it primarily means. Since you meant something else, namely ‘belief without evidence’ which is a secondary and less common definition, you should have said so in your premises. Otherwise you make the debate ripe for miscommunication (or word games, depending on your intent).\n\n> by saying that people should be confident in evidence you proved my point.\n\nAs I said, I agree with your point now that you’ve changed your premise to indicate that you’re not using the primary/most common definition of the word faith.\n\n> So I think we agree that faith is unreliable\n\nWhen defining faith as your new premise defines it, yes.\n\n> and following evidence is the superior way in determining what is true or not.\n\nYes.",

If that’s what you meant, then you were simply assuming your conclusion. “Religious faith is useless because religious faith (by my definition, which isn’t the primary definition of faith, but I’m not going to say that clearly) is what someone does when they lack evidence.”\n\nIn reality, just because you don’t have evidence of deity doesn’t mean no one else has ever had any. Plenty of religious people claim their faith is based on evidence personally experienced. You’re basically assuming that if divinity existed it would be something everyone could experience if one did as well as assuming everyone is like you and has your experiences.\n\n> My bad.\n\nBad? It’s a good way to get upvotes among evangelical atheists. It’s a good way to feed the need for confirmation bias in an echo chamber of mostly people who assume your conclusions too. Similarly, assuming the opposite conclusion while phrasing it as if it were a logical argument would be a good way for a misleading (or misled) person to get upvotes in the ‘TrueChristian’ sub.\n\nUltimately it is more of a self declaration, in your case declaring that spirituality hasn’t been made evident to you. No need to apologize for that. You just framed it as an argument, when it really isn’t one. You framed it in a misleading way by assuming your conclusion without saying so in your premises (and instead letting it appear that you were not doing so). If that’s what you’re apologizing for… no need to apologize to me for that. Being misleading and assuming your conclusion, when I don’t fall for it, hurts you more than me.",
