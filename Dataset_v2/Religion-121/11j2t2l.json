    "Post_Title": "\"Trust in God\" is really just \"Trust in what other humans claim about their God\".",
    "post_text ": "Whether it's a direct quote from your favorite book of 'scripture', or it's what some preacher/imam/rabbi/guru/shaman/neighbor/parent/etc has to say about those words, it is still being delivered to us via human intermediaries. Sometimes a handful of them, sometimes a very long line that went through ancient oral traditions and multiple translations before ever reaching us.\n\nSo when someone tells me to \"Trust in God\", what they really mean is:\n\n1. \"Trust all the various human beings who supposedly interacted with this specific idea of 'God'.\"\n2. **EDIT:** \"Trust that the 'God' in question was itself being honest and trustworthy.\" -suggested by /u/CautiousCold8392 \n3. \"Trust that they (the human intermediary) told the complete truth about all those interactions.\"\n4. \"Trust that their words about those interactions were all recorded accurately.\"\n5. \"Trust that those words were all passed down the generations and translated correctly.\"\n6. \"Trust that the modern people telling you how to interpret those words today are also being honest and accurate with all their ideas about those interactions.\"\n7. **EDIT:** \"Trust that all of the people advocating for one specific 'God'/religion are reliable *and* that all others advocating for other \\[contradicting\\] 'Gods'/religions are not, in an environment in which neither can prove their claims.\" -suggested by /u/Zeebuss\n8. Also, \"DON'T trust any of the 'false prophets', and 'by their fruits ye shall know them'. Even though all the so-called 'prophets' make unproven and untestable claims, and many of the supposedly 'true' ones have told people to commit horrible violence, while the 'false' ones can seem rather innocuous by comparison.\"\n9. And, above all, \"Trust that the vague feelings you have in your heart are actually 'Divine Guidance', and that will be your ultimate guide to 'Truth'. Even though those feelings are impossible to accurately describe, and might as well be referring to heartburn, or unearned confidence, or a whole host of other symptoms that are unrelated to any of the above things that need to be trusted in order to finally start trusting the 'God' in question.\"\n\nIf a 'God', who is presumably wise and powerful and interested in my wellbeing, wants me to have a trusting relationship with them, then why are there so many degrees of separation? Why do I have to trust all these intermediary humans?\n\n**That doesn't seem like a great way to establish a relationship of TRUST.**\n\nIf this is all so important for my 'soul', then why not just cut out all the middle men and communicate with me directly?\n\n**I suspect that the real reason is that there never was such a 'God' involved with any of this in the first place.**\n\nOr perhaps the way this 'God' shows they are wise and powerful and interested in my wellbeing is by acting as if they are foolish and impotent and completely disinterested in my wellbeing, all while expecting me to be as gullible as possible about some of the most dubious claims humans have ever made in the history of this planet.\n\n**What part of any of this should I find convincing enough to grant it my TRUST?**",

In order to connect my existence to the existence of a \"God\", you would first need evidence that actually connects the two ideas. (And even more evidence to connect me to a \"God\" who acknowledges me in some way.)\n\n>And if you make an attempt to communicate with God through prayer, then he will be there. You might not see it or feel it, but he is there.\n\n\"He will be there\" how? As I said, I have tried. For years and years, I tried my absolute best to communicate with \"God\". Any \"God\", not just the Christian one, as a way to cover all the bases.\n\nAnd nothing happened. I never once noticed any discernable change or feeling or \"presence\". All I ever felt, through all those efforts, was increasingly empty and let down.\n\n>God knows all of your attempts, and he is proud for what you've done.\n\nThen he knows where I live and how to contact me. If he can't be bothered, after all my genuine attempts, then I see no reason to trust that he exists. And just as importantly, I see no reason to believe that he is worthy of my trust, even if he did exist.\n\n>Why do you think that God does not respond to you?\n\nAs stated in the OP, I suspect that it is simply because there never was any sort of \"God\" involved in any of this. It has only ever been humans, and we are on our own here.\n\nThat might sound bleak to you, but that's the \"inconvenient truth\", as far as I can tell.",

I myself do not actually know these things about you, and how can I?\nBut I had this feeling of happiness inside that wasn't from me while typing that comment, and I felt compelled to tell you that God is proud of what you've done.\nNow let's say that the existence of God cannot be proven nor disproven, so for argument sake let's just say that God is 100% real.\n(Even though I already do believe this.)\nThe fact that you are alive right now is proof that God acknowledges your existence because if God didn't acknowledge you, then you would be dead.\nWhen you pray to God he is there in spirit. He hears and sees your every prayer.\nThe fact that you prayed to numerous God's means that you have a lack of belief in faith and in God, and knowing this God might not have responded to you because he knew that your heart and being wasn't 100% into it.\nI know the feeling of discouragement and feeling let down after praying, but this is because we build up an expectation of what We want from God instead of letting God give us what he has to offer.\nNow does this mean that God will answer us all the time every time after prayer? Probably not, but I would rather pray and feel nothing than to not pray at all. Because I know that human emotions can manipulate our thoughts, and that the devil knows how to use this to trick us.\nSo just because you felt emptiness doesn't mean that God wasn't listening.\nAnd I'm sorry to say but it's not God's job to come and find you.\nNow although God will and has done this for certain people throughout history it is still our job for us to chase him based on our love for him\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry that your experiences with God weren't all that you were hoping for, but I had been in your shoes for a while as well when I first started praying.\n\nI didn't feel, see, or hear anything, so what was the point, right?\n\nBut overtime I learned that just because I didn't feel any change didn't mean that God wasn't making any for me.\n\nNow I don't agree with your opinion that it has only ever been humans, and that we are on our own, but I respect the fact that you have one, and can see how you came up with that conclusion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow before I end this message I would just like to ask for your blessing to pray for you. Whether you feel comfortable with this or not is up to you.",

It is a false hope, and it makes me sad to see people still clinging to these ideas.\n\nSo, instead of praying for me, or anyone else, I would only ask you to just go out and do something nice for someone, and I will do the same. Physical acts of kindness will do more to improve the world than any prayer ever will.",

It's evolutionary psychology in action. We observe it in nature daily.\n\nWe participate in society because the benefits for most of us outweigh the risks, and for those who go against it and threaten society, we separate or destroy, as the needs of the many outweighs the needs of the few.\n\nThe laws that make sense for society to follow may have a solid historical foundation, but they also survive a period of enlightened, rational, logical discourse. Most Christian laws didn't. Because we knew that it was a bullshit premise to ban the eating of certain kinds of seafood or the wearing of certain fabrics or, nowadays, ban certain sexual acts between consenting adults. Society is allowed to grow, to change, to evolve, not remain stagnant and complacent in an enforced era of the same bronze-aged values that your religion tries to pass off.\n\n>If you also think that Christianity is man made, then that means that you think that God is man made, which means that you are not calling God a liar, but you are calling other humans the liars.\n>\n>So why are you blaming God for things that you think humans created?\n\nAha, finally a point of contention worthy of discourse!\n\nI in fact ***do*** believe that god (especially your idea of what 'god' is) is man-made. And I do in fact believe, in a roundabout way, that other humans are liars about religion and the supernatural. So I in fact do not blame 'god'. There's nothing to blame. There is no 'god' that I can see or experience or observe empirically.\n\nIn the context of this discussion, it's a made up, uber-perfect invisible entity created by human minds to be beyond human physical experiential sensation and given magical abilities to be beyond the scope of what we can test in our universe. And it's made up by cynical, self-centered, generally ethically and morally repugnant cretinous fascists who seek their own dominion and domination over those who might listen to them, and the extermination and annihilation of those who would not.",
