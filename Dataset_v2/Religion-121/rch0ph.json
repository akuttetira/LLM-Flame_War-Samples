    "post_text ": "I speak from experience as an agnostic exmuslim.\n\nI asked my own devout muslim mother \"You're my mother, you know me and my character. If I died today, the way I am, do you think I deserve to go to hell and burn forever?\"\n\nAnd she said yes. She said i deserve it for not obeying God. And that she wouldn't have any sympathy for me once I am in hell. \n\nMy mother is a nice person. She's caring and loving and funny. But when it comes to religion, she turns into this evil callous monster that I dont recognise. \n\nIts not just my mother. Every Muslim or Christian or anyone who believes in a physical hell, directly or indirectly accepts people deserve to burn forever. \n\nPeople lose their humanity and put love for an invisible deity over love for a real physical human infront of them.\n\nIt saddens me and disappoints me that a good person would say something so horrendous just because a religion told them it was the right  \n\n\n\nMy argument is that religion does something to the human mind in the same way a drug does. It changes your perception on reality and that can be very dangerous. \n\nIt \"others\" everybody that doesn't share your views and as a result you lose empathy for them and you accept the worst torture is justified upon them.",

You are not a good person. Your definition of good is what culture calls good. Go beyond your culture. To be good is to be self less. To be self less is to love God. Just focus on that and don’t worry about going to hell.",

Who decided your mother was good and you are bad? However, from an Islamic perspective you could be identical in all action but belief in God and your mother would be a better person because of it.\n\nWhy? Because God, and in the case of Islamic understanding, the all powerful and all knowing, literally said so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>So its baffling she thinks I deserve hell.\n\nIts not really. If she is a Muslim and believes in the Quran as the revelation of God then its not hard to infer that if one disobeys God then he or she is deserving of Hellfire because again God said so.",
