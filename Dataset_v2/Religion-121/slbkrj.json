    "Post_Title": "Islam is a religion deserving way more criticism than Christianity, Judaism or any of the religions of the east.",
    "post_text ": "Say what you want about the latter religions mentioned. Christianity sets examples for morals and a way of life and how to treat each other. Say what you want about how the Catholic Church operated throughout the Middle Ages and what not, though the majority of misdoings I believe was due mainly to human flaws (greed power lust). Former colonist countries. \n\nIslam is the only religion that explicitly calls for death to homosexuals, death to adulterers, genital mutilation. Burkas and Hijabs are blatant oppression contrary to the liberal stance of such things being empowering which is nonsense. The idea of dying for Allah in jihad and getting all the virgins you want is such an immature concept. Every Muslim country is oppressive (actually oppressive) to a degree. And the extremists of the religion all have a violent expansionist vision that’s existed since it’s inception. \n\nMy question is why don’t atheists nearly criticize Islam as much as Christianity from where as far as I can tell if you don’t abide by Christianity you’re rather ineffected by it? I mean even in an “extreme” Christian country (be it Poland or Italy or whatever) you’re not at risk of any punishment or threat as someone in Saudi Arabia, Iran, or increasingly even Turkey. \n\nI guess in my mind it’s easier to target a religion like Christianity that you have no repercussions of doing so. No one’s going to threaten to cut your head off if you bash Christianity or Judaism or Buddhism. I’m sick of seeing all these anti-Christian posts without any comment about Muhammad and his multiple wives (child wife), the actions taken by Muslim theocratic governments that exists TODAY. I mean common it’s just very questionable to me.\n\nEDIT: you guys throwing Leviticus at me like you’re proving a point is ridiculous and shows you have no understanding or context of that verse. I’m not here debating Islam I have no interest in doing that as to me personally it’s just an obvious heresy of Christianity, Judaism and former pagan religions of Arabia. The whole point of my post is that while you have an unlimited desire to take shots at Christianity TODAY lacks substance if you’re not going to first criticize Islam. TODAY Muslims are killing gays, adulterers and apostates. I mean there’s people in the comments, ex Muslims stating how they fear saying anything in their countries because they fear their safety! Doesn’t that give you guys a damn clue!!",

At first the verse of \"To you be your religion and to me be mine\" was revealed when muhammed did not have an army and was in the minority. The second stage comes when muhammed took over medina and had the means to defend it but did not have the man power to take over a place and therefore verses were revealed to make peace like chapter 60 in order for him to bolster his army. Then once he had enough of an army and took over mecca the durah 9:29 was revealed. At this point he was the most powerful force in arabia and had the means to subjugate other non muslims lands. Those are the stages of jihad that has existed in the Quran if you have ever read it holistically.\n\nAs for your comments on jews being killed who are zionist. That has nothing to do with our topic. Surah 9:29 is also considered the last mandate of god to muslims. Meaning that every muslim leader with an army capable of subjugating a non muslim land they must do so as it is prescribed to them.",

On that, Quraish thought that this would reduce their profits from trade. Therefore, Allah, Most High, compensated them and ordered them to fight the people of the Book until they embrace Islam or pay the Jizyah. Allah says, “O ye who believe! Truly the pagans are unclean; so let them not, after this year of theirs, approach the sacred Mosque. And if ye fear poverty, soon will Allah enrich you, if He wills, out of His bounty, for Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, from among the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizyah with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.” Therefore, the Messenger of Allah decided to fight the Romans in order to call them to Islam.\n\nTafsir Ibn Kathir (on Qur’an 9:30)—Fighting the Jews and Christians is legislated because they are idolaters and disbelievers. Allah the Exalted encourages the believers to fight the polytheists, disbelieving Jews and Christians, who uttered this terrible statement and utter lies against Allah, the Exalted. As for the Jews, they claimed that Uzayr was the son of God, Allah is free of what they attribute to Him. As for the misguidance of Christians over Isa, it is obvious.\n\nword of advice.

I’m kind of unbelieving and shocked that someone who can leave Islam was called to talk in an Islamic seminar. Hmm\n\nYour shock does not mitigate the fact that many scholars teach this on the first year of islamic seminary. This is something very basic. The concept of dar al harb and dar al islam started by muhammed himself. If you need more references on the stages of jihad if you dar al salam version of sahih al bukhari there is an essay by sheikh umaid who used to be the cheif justice of saudi arabia and the custodian of mecca at the time saying that.\n\n>Thats surah at Tawbah ayat 29. In there Allah said to not let disbelievers enter the sacred mosque\n\nThat is incorrect. Surah 9:29 is a different group from the verses before it. Notice the difference between Mushrikoon (pagans) and yahood and nassara( jews and christians. The sacred mosque is referring to the pagans not the people of the book. The Quran is very clear. The people of the book is first mentioned starting from 9:29 and there is no avoiding it. You muslims are commanded to fight christians and jews and take away their self determination from their own land and subjugate them based on their belief NOT because they are attacking you.\n\n>Jizyah is a way to persuade them to convert to Islam and because there is no such thing as taxes in Islam, kafir should at least pay tribute or heed to the Islam countries that are protecting them. I repeat there is no such thing called TAX in Islam\n\nAgreed. It was a way to humiliate them and debase them into conversion.  The word Saghiroon means humiliated, debased, accept their inferiority. No body pays taxes while they accept their humiliation. That is something i agree with you.\n\nAlso here is another reference that 9:29 abrogates all peaceful passages.\n\nAs you know abrogation is a thing in islam.\n\nQur'an 2:106—“Whatever communications We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, We bring one better than it or like it. Do you not know that Allah has power over all things?”\n\nTherefore we have to know which verse came last. Otherwise you have two contradictory verses and we cant have that in islam. So if we go to bukhari we find chapter 9 is the last revealed chapter\n\nSahih al-Bukhari 4364—The last complete Surah which was revealed (to the Prophet) was Bara’a (chapter 9)\n\nIf that is the case, then weread the chapter and we find the surah 9:29 is the final message from god to muslims when ot comes to war and peace. So basically the end game for muslims is to reach critical mass and takeover non kuslim lands just like muhammed did when he took over medina then mecca.\n\nAgain this is basic stuff we learned in islamic seminary.",

The quran is very explicit when it comes to progression of jihad. At first the verse of \"To you be your religion and to me be mine\" was revealed when muhammed did not have an army and was in the minority. The second stage comes when muhammed took over medina and had the means to defend it but did not have the man power to take over a place and therefore verses were revealed to make peace like chapter 60 in order for him to bolster his army. Then once he had enough of an army and took over mecca the durah 9:29 was revealed. At this point he was the most powerful force in arabia and had the means to subjugate other non muslims lands. Those are the stages of jihad that has existed in the Quran if you have ever read it holistically.\n\nTheir is no such thing as \"first Jihad\" how the heck are you teaching at Islamic seminaries, these are one of the tropes he only fought  when he left to medina and he had an army, its honestly laughable, as someone who taught at \"Islamic seminaries\" you would know that their was a peace treaty, I wonder if you also know who decided to break that treaty, I'm sure you do... perhaps?\n\nThis is basic knowledge every Muslim would know, he already converted the whole city of medina to Islam and never started a war you clown.\n\n\n>As for your comments on jews being killed who are zionist. That has nothing to do with our topic. Surah 9:29 is also considered the last mandate of god to muslims. Meaning that every muslim leader with an army capable of subjugating a non muslim land they must do so as it is prescribed to them.\n\nWhere'd you get this information from perhaps you got it from  \"Tafsir Antelope26\"?\nYou're attempting to sneak in your own interpretation pretty dishonest of you.",

So here we go.\n\nNumber 1, the VAST majority of commentators are on my side. All you have to do is google on quranx and it will give you a list. And yes tabari and mujahid are on it. The rest say that it is mandatory to violent subjugate jews and christians based on their beliefs\nhttps://quranx.com/tafsirs/9.29\n\nNumber 2, Where are the jews mentioned in the tafsir that you just gave me? Are jews romans too? Didnt your allah know that there were jews in arabia that were not romans? How does this tafsir of mujahid/tabari make any sense?\n\nNumber 3, cant your allah say thw word Rome? There is an entire chapter dedicated to it in the quran yet somehow he cant say the same words in the surah 9:29? Are you telling me your allah can be specific at one point in time yet when it comes to its last command on the last xhapter he revealed which abrogates all other verses he decides to use the word nassara instead of Rome?\n\nI knew you were going to post this article quiet frankly the author of this article has been thoroughly debunked many times. Notice how he goes back and forth using different chapters of the quran and creating his own sequence since we know the last chapter of the quran is surah 9 according to bukhari as well Sahih al-Bukhari 4364—The last complete Surah which was revealed (to the Prophet) was Bara’a\n\nwhich means he is quoting abrogated verses and putting them after surah 9:29 what a joke man😄\n\nRemember Qur'an 2:106—“Whatever communications We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, We bring one better than it or like it. Do you not know that Allah has power over all things?” making surah 9:29 the final order of allah when it comes to war and peace.",
