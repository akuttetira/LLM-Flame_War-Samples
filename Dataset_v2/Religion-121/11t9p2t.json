    "post_text ": "Hypothesis: Further evidence that God is man made is found in the rules that the Abrahamic religions put forth as God’s rules. These rules mostly benefit men by giving them unique legal, economic and societal and even physical powers over women. \n\nI believe that the misogyny found in the Bible and the Quran are a product of a very human Bible and Quran. We all know the controversy surrounding the Islamic rules on women. I won’t go into the depths of Islam because I’m not versed enough to speak on the Quran. But I assume that we all know women have few rights in most Islamic countries. Right down to them being killed. \n\nIslam looks like Christianity did 100 years ago. Just as draconian and just as misogynistic. Despite positive changes, in 2023, men are still on the receiving end of the power of the church and many Christian denominations still push the doctrine that puts men as the decision maker, spiritual leader, money maker and provider. Man is only subject to God. His wife is subject to her husband. This setup is presented as God’s natural order. Making it God’s order cuts off any discussion. I find this demonically clever. \n\nIn many Christian denominations, if you follow the letter of their law, women must be submissive to their husbands. They cannot become clergy. They do not have control over their own bodies. The man dominated household means that the wife is hostage to the economic patriarchy. Many conservative denominations advocate corporal punishment for wives. Here are few of these denominations:\n\nPentecostal\n\nCatholic Church\n\nAmish/Mennonites \n\nApostolic Christians\n\nIBLP/Quiverfull\n\nEvangelical Presbyterian\n\nChurch of Christ\n\nSouthern Baptist\n\nSource for wife corporal punishment:\n\nhttps://www.huffpost.com/entry/christian-domestic-discipline-spanking-jesus-marriage_n_3479646\n\nAlmost all domestic, spiritual, martial, economic, leadership, control, church or personal independence rule found in Christianity eventually benefits men. This shows one more piece of evidence that God is a reflection of us and is of our own making.\n\nEdit: If you want biblical sources for this, ask.",

            "Reply_Text": "I believe you are too easily throwing such strong word as misoginy around. Patriarchal societies, whether religious or not can become tyrannical (but so can matriarchal too) and its tyrannical patriarchal societies that actually start behaving and thinking in misoginist ways.\n\nHeres other part of story:\n\nWomen in patriarchal monotheist marriages have far more influence on children than men do, not only cause they naturally spend more time with them but also cause they are obliged to ethically influence them and teach them manners and encourage prosocial behavior, while fathers are mostly there to instill sense of discipline, guidance and emotional stability in the household.\n\nWomen also get rights to inherit material wealth incl. Even houses despite not being their builders in society as in patriarchal societies its men who have to work and build, not women.\n\nWomen also get motherly instinct satisfied and spend more time in peace and as a result can retain their softer, physical and aesthetical femininity better than if they have to run to work and be responsible for otherwise stressful jobs and lets be honest, most jobs are demanding in many dimensions, competitive and stressful. In essence family and home oriented life is less stressful than full time jobs and as result women are less bound to be neurotic and as result more feminine.\n\nTheres also paradox of female happiness concerned with more feminist infuenced societies, where woman has many privileges, choices and employment freedoms but as a result still being unhappy and even depressed, theres a well known study on this, its easy to find.\n\nAlso in monotheist patriarchies men rule over material and managerial matters but they have to pay the price of taking up responsibility, its not a game where men win at no cost, far from that, especially due to having to compete and retain competence over vast majority of their lives, whereas women are mostly free from such stress and expectations and this is also why women on average live significantly longer than men afaik last time i checked it was 69.5 years world average for men and 74 years world average for women, that is actually huge difference.",

It's not a binary either/or choice.\n\nAdditionally, you're creating a false dichotomy between promoting gender equality and promoting healthy masculinity. This is also fallacious. Your logic is so full of holes that I could cast it into the sea and catch fish with it.\n\nPatriarchy isn't a neutral concept that is removed from the degeneracy you're speaking of, either. Giving men a position of inherent power brings with it the inevitable eventuality of it being abused. Point to one single fucking patriarchal society in history where you'd rather be a woman than a man. There aren't any if you're being honest, and if you think there are then you need a history lesson.\n\nTrying to maintain a power imbalance between genders for any reason is misogynistic. Period. Someday, people like you will be gone from the earth, and I hope it's sooner rather than later.",

I think we're more afraid of the abuse we are likely to face being married to a Muslim man or having one as a father. If I could pick either being abused or competing with a man in sports, I'd pick the competing man in sports.",

I'm unhappy and somewhat depressed, but not cause I'm not at home with a screaming baby all day that trigger my very sensitive migraines, but because working feels like a neverending rat race.. there's high demands, its physically tolling..and there's no chance in hell I can ever afford a house or an apartment or a home, so I've all but given up on that and resigned myself to co living with roommates.

Instead of understanding that their role is to provide security, they have become drunk with the power that role provides. They see women as an asset, not as a person to secure. They find ways to shortcut their responsibilities, and ensuring that they are superior when they aren't, they just have a role of responsibility. Responsibility doesn't equal superiority. You know what responsibility is in Islam? Lowering your gaze, but no, instead of doing that, Muslim men thinks its better to push a burkha, niqab, hand gloves, forcing women to silence their voice because it is an \"awrah\" and secluding them from society, because if they are out of sight, men don't have to do the responaible thing of lowering their gaze and policing their sexuality.\n\n>How do you bare with these facts as someone who identifies as muslim but who also hates/sees only bad in Patriarchy and no good?\n\nI identify as Muslim and see that the Muslim men who exist in Islamic patriarchy are damaging, weak and corrupted. They are not fit to uphold the role that Allah gave to them. Only a minority of Muslim men have the calibre to undertake the role they have been given. The rest have abused their position and the mess that is the Muslim world is down to their hypocrisy. Allah says the hypocrites will inhabit the lowest depths of hell. We're seeing it all now.\n\n>or let his wife in household work for him and pay for his bills for example, I dont think this will ever happen cause there's no basis in Islam for this.\n\nThen you are extremely naive/sheltered and you haven't seen much. This exists. Muslims practicing Islam doesn't equal Islam.",
