    "post_text ": "If a Christian were to see that the Quran says the sun sets in a muddy spring or that it literally goes somewhere (resting place) at night, they'd very quickly write it off as a scientific inaccuracy. However, a Muslim's cognitive biases will probably have them undertake some advanced mental gymnastics to reinterpret the verse to match reality.  In the same way, a Muslim would look at Genesis, and see that plants were created before the Sun, and immediately write it off  as proof that it has been corrupted. The Christian would then undertake advanced mental gymnastics, and state that it means something other than what it says, or it is all metaphorical when it has clearly become embarrassing to hold a literal interpretation.\n\nWhereas the logical method is to draw conclusions from facts, these strong preconceptions drive people to bend the facts to match a conclusion established in advance. I understand that everyone may be biased to a degree, but to baselessly say something means other than what it explicitly says is intellectually dishonest.",

Text can be very clear, can also be ambiguous.\n\nThis is not sophistry, I am saying I do not have a foundationalist epistemology, and I especially do not have one with text. So I do not believe you can make text the foundation for the same text. That is begging the question, circular reasoning, and epistemological bootstrapping.\n\nThe text \"Jesus cried\" would at first glance sound to you to be incredibly clear language that we can then say everyone can agree on.\n\nNo, we can't.\n\nWhen most protestants, or members of the Church of the East read \"Jesus cried\", they read it as being 'the human person of Jesus cried'. When Orthodox read it, we read it as being 'the divine person of Jesus cried'. We do not agree on what the word \"Jesus\" means.\n\nWhen literalists read \"Jesus cried\", they picture tears rolling down his cheeks. When someone who believes the bible is purely metaphorical reads it, they interpret it as being related to sadness, or some other understanding. When someone like me who believes in a symbolic understanding, I understand \"Jesus cried\" to be imaging higher water and seeds of meaning being expressed through lower reality. We do not agree on what the word \"cries\" means.\n\nIf no one can even agree on what \"Jesus\" means, or what \"cries\" means, and we all use different hermeneutics and different epistemologies, how can there be any neutral ground clear explicit self-referential meaning? That is nonsense.\n\n>What do you believe?\n\nI explained it in detail to another commenter. I believe all of reality is composed of union or separation of higher meaning and lower expression.\n\n>Your diverting. It is often the case that conveniently, anything that is demonstrably false is taken metaphorically.\n\nI'm not diverting, you are. What does \"It is often the case\" even mean? All christians? All protestants? All catholics? Who? How often? Where? Do you have any actual statistics or are you just asserting something to be true according to your own biased understanding and experiences?",

That's not what I'm contesting. I know that you said \"everyone has a tendency to cling to their prior conceptions\". That is not what I am contesting.\n\nWhat i am contesting, is the idea that because people have a tendency to cling to prior conceptions, and the idea that theists follow certain methodologies (they dont; there are plenty of different methodologies that can't be conflated), does not lead us to then say that theism is more likely to not use critical thinking.\n\nThat is a non-sequitur. I don't think there's even any other further addendums you could add; it would still be an overgeneralization.\n\n>The bible cant present me any evidence to believe in God. Therefore, I reject it.\n\nAs I said, I am not a sola scripturist protestant. The Bible is not what is supposed to provide us with evidence of God. We aren't just supposed to read the Bible and come to our own conclusion based upon the text as to whether or not God is true. That is nonsense, and I agree that if I had done that with the Bible, I would not believe in it. But that is a false methodology.\n\n>Evidence is the only logical reason to believe in things.\n\nWhat kind of evidence?\n\n>I am 100% consistent with logical reasoning.\n\nOnly if you are correct in saying that your kind of evidence is the right kind of evidence, or that your methodology is the right kind of methodology.

Protestantism is not all of Christianity. I am Orthodox Christian. We do not have the same issues as with protestantism.\n\nHowever, this is still begging the question. What is \"obvious\" and \"problematic\" about this supposed \"conflict with science\"?\n\nIt's the appeal to incredulity fallacy. And it is presuppositions that the current scientific consensus is what is most true.\n\nYou aren't questioning your prior conceptions. You are questioning your presuppositions or biases. You are being a hypocrite, which is why I brought up that Bible verse.\n\n>but 0 evidence to believe in something as bold as christianity.\n\nThank you for assuming that I have no evidence and have not thoroughly studied this and criticized my own beliefs for years and years. I used to be the staunchest nihilist possible, not believing that any of the external world existed. You know nothing of what my evidences are. You know nothing of what my beliefs are. And yet you assume the worst of me. What is that except for hypocritical ego?\n\nI have perfectly valid and good reasons for believing in Christianity.

But you are hypocritically holding on to them without any analysis, while accusing all theists of the same exact thing.\n\nAlso, religion and Atheism require the same amount of evidence to establish them.

In fact you don't even need to do this, as literally interpreting biblical tales often comes into conflict with science. It is a widely observed modern phenomenon.\n\n>Also, religion and Atheism require the same amount of evidence to establish them\n\nReligion makes an active claim and the burden on proof rests on it. If I told you I believed in fairies, and you said you were agnostic (to the point of practically atheistic) about them, it's on me to provide evidence to support my claim. I would argue that the evidence for Yahweh and for fairies is equally poor. I'm sorry if this degrades your religious beliefs as that is not my intent. Atheism is simply the lack of belief.\n\nYou have presumed that I am an atheist, which is not the case.\n\n>You say this without even knowing what my evidence for Christianity is, or what my beliefs on Christianity are.\n\nI would like to know. However, no one is going to seriously argue that there is _empirical evidence_ for God, much less for yahweh in particular. You may wish to provide some logical seeming cosmological argument for the existence of a generic God.\n\n>Nothing in that post addresses or contradicts my view of God.\n\nDo you believe in hell? If you have adopted your own variant and interpretation of Christianity, and don't believe in hell for example, then without telling me I obviously cannot argue against your specific belief. Hence, I provided a generic criticism of Christianity. I do apologise for my direct wording.\n\n>This isn't even an ad hominem at this point\n\nI haven't attacked your character.\n\n>labeling of every theist as a bad actor,\n\nI conceded my title was poor? You are insistent on pushing this claim and do not concede that I never claimed malicious intent. You're misunderstanding and insist on presenting this false ignorance or malicious intent dilemma.\n\nI never made the claim that you aren't convinced by your beliefs or that they are not genuine. I'm sorry, but all I'm saying is the burden of proof is all on you. As a general statement there is nothing that, for example, makes Christianity more true than Islam or vice versa in that the evidence for both is equally insufficient.",

That is an example of mental gymnastics, just as it is when selectively reinterpreting the bible where it is mistaken .\n\nThis seemed interesting so I searched and found [this article](https://rationalreligion.co.uk/does-the-quran-say-the-sun-sets-in-a-muddy-spring/), which suggests that \"the sun setting in a muddy spring\" is just a way of talking. It's as right or wrong as speaking of the sun \"rising\" or \"setting\". Everyone would have understood (i) the sun as putting out heat; (ii) it gets hotter the closer you get to a heat source; (iii) the sun literally setting in muddy spring would have been far more fantastic than dropping a hot coal in a pot of water.

Mattieu Pageaus book \"The Language of Creation\" details it much further, or he has [videos with his brother Jonathan](https://youtu.be/0VIRA6T33o4) on the topic.\n\nAt the most basic level, it is saying that all of reality is composed of two things:\n\n1. Higher meaning\n2. Lower expression\n\nAnd at every level, there is some way in which they either unite, or are separated.\n\nSo a good example used in the video I linked, is that in the garden of Eden, the snake is a symbol of time. To modern thinkers, this seems like an arbitrary metaphor or analogy or allegory; it is not. Or to literalists, that idea would sound like time is a literal physical snake moving in a garden; it is not. Not literal or metaphorical.\n\nWhen someone understands time in the ancient view, as being change, the force of change in the world, then the snake being a symbol of time begins to make sense.\n\nThe snake was the instigator of change in the garden, from the unadulterated state of paradise, into the fall. The snake is the objective lower expression within physical reality, of the higher meaning of time.\n\nAll of the bible is incredibly deeply symbolic like this is. All of reality is organized with these kinds of symbols, at a fractal level. The reason there are so many face-value paradoxes in the bible, is that God is trying to get us to look towards the higher spiritual meaning that is present, rather than focus upon physical literalism. He is trying to unite all meaning, and all expression, into one.\n\nThere is the paradox of a living cannibalism of Christs body, or the paradox of death bringing life, or the paradox of the unwedded bride of the Theotokos, or many others.\n\nThe entire bible is the meta-patterns of all other symbolic patterns, compressing them into a united pattern. And when you compress so many patterns together into one pattern, it is going to inevitably sound like a paradox to everyone outside of that pattern. It is inevitably going to sound crazy to people who do not wish to unite into the meta-union.",

He also has [a clip channel](https://www.youtube.com/@JonathanPageauClips), and Mattieu just recently started his own channel with no videos yet. They do some good discussions with John Vervaeke, a neurologist who shows how the symbolic view is actually scientifically demonstrated in many ways. I highly recommend the series Jonathan does called [Universal history](https://youtu.be/_N5s4n_lwB8), since even if you aren't interested in the symbolism of the bible, he talks about how this symbolism plays out throughout medieval history; Groundhog day is from the medieval holiday of Candlemas.\n\nBut really, I would recommend starting with the book \"Language of Creation\", since if you just browse Jonathans channel, it can be hard to understand how he interprets things, since you won't have as much of a basis for why. They don't really cover that section of it as much, but expect people to pick up the patterns over time by experiencing it; which to be fair, is how it generally is meant to happen in the liturgy in church. I'm actually planning on writing some things about it since there's so little material on this way of thinking. There is talk about this kind of symbolism in the church fathers and saints, but you have to do a lot of digging to find it.\n\nI would recommend [The Lord of Spirits podcast](https://www.ancientfaith.com/podcasts/lordofspirits/angels_and_demons_introducing_lord_of_spirits) as well, as they speak on some great understandings that aren't talked about very much; like the Monolatry/henotheism of Christianity, or other interesting topics.\n\nAnd also, the very best answer to this, is that we are teaching and uncovering the Parable of Parables that Jesus taught:\n\nMark 4:13 \"And he said to them, “Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables?\"\n\nThe parable of the sower of seeds is the understanding of all of reality, the entirety of the cosmos contained within it.\n\nFor all of reality is about the higher meaning sending forth seeds into lower expression. All of reality is about the union of the two; whether you understand it through farming, or rain, or fire, or animals, or love-making, or whatever else; any single category of existence you look at has the union or separation of meaning and expression\n\nHopefully in explaining the parable of all parables to you, as Christ said to the apostles;\n\nAnd he said to them, “To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God, but for those outside everything is in parables, 12 so that\n\n“‘they may indeed see but not perceive,\nand may indeed hear but not understand,\nlest they should turn and be forgiven.’”\n\nFor I believe since we are reaching the endtimes, the secret of the kingdom of God is becoming more manifest, even to those outside of it.",

All stories point to the story of Christ. That isn't an argument against it, that is an argument for it. Again, this is not arbitrary metaphors. It is not something you can just pick and choose willy nilly; it is the objective reality beyond all reality. The pattern of all patterns. Fairy tales and mythology lead to Christ.",

The stories of Chuck Tingle don't point to Christ. Other religions would call you deeply disturbed and claim your mythologies point to the innate truth of their chosen deity/prophet/ideas.\n\n>it is the objective reality beyond all reality.\n\nIt is not objective, you say these words with no evidence and absolute bravado. Your mythology does not grasp reality very well. There are tons of contradictions and easily disproven claims (chemically, biologically, historically and others). You 'resolve' those obvious contradictions with mental gymnastics, is a puffery and cope without pessary substance.\n\n> Fairy tales and mythology lead to Christ.\n\nAll assertions, no evidence. Go read the works of Chuck Tingle, only after you have sufficient tied in those stories will I respond.",
