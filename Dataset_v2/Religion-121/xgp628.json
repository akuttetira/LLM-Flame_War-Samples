Christianity is the favored faith in 28 of the 40 countries with a preferred religion. More than half of the total provide funds or resources for religious education programs that largely benefit the preferred religion, and a third provide funding or resources for religious buildings.\n\nIn the [Maldives](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/maldives-population), [Mauritania](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/mauritania-population), and [Saudi Arabia](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/saudi-arabia-population), 100% of inhabitants practice Islam.

If a Christian is born into their faith and doesn't take the time to consider other options, this is true.\n\nHowever, there are a lot of Muslims that know significantly more about Christianity than a lot of Christians.\n\nBut yeah this argument assumes religious people are just unintelligent sheep that go with the herd. Have you considered that maybe you were born in a part of the world where religion was practiced with self-righteousness and hypocrisy, and that turned you away from religion?\n\nI think there is some truth that some atheists are driven by their experience with religion rather than their own understanding of the religion itself.",

A generalization so imprecise it is probably wrong but I'ma say it anyway\n\nWhether or not someone follows the dominant religion of their culture has no bearing on the truths (or lackthereof) of that religion",

It takes a lot of courage to challenge beliefs that the majority accept as true. It's also difficult to understand if you are confident in your perception or if you are just being prideful and arrogant in your understanding.\n\nIt's like for someone in the military to disobey an unlawful order. They have to be willing to accept very heavy consequences for doing what they think is right because the officer in charge will absolutely see it as mutiny and condemn the innocent.",

A baby does not hold a belief in a god, but also does not know that a god doesn't exist, therefore that is what we call agnosticism. I'm not sure how you could possibly argue that means something different than agnosticism.\n\nA baby doesn't hold a belief in a god specifically, but it does seem to hold a belief in some kind of higher power.\n\n\"Agnosticism is the view or belief that the existence of God, of the divine or the supernatural is unknown or unknowable. Another definition provided is the view that \"human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist.\"\n\nAgnosticism would entail the baby believing that a god is unknowable/not known.\n\nIf we say the baby has no beliefs then that also excludes agnosticism and if we look at some studies then babies have some basic level of theistic belief.",

Scientific discoveries of humankind——all the way from making fire, making stone tools, creating the wheel, to discovering electricity, nuclear power, and the digital world——every discovery in science has been used one way or the either in the destruction of other human beings or the environment itself. It would not be just or accurate to state that the discoveries in science are all “just products of culture”. No, the “true source” of the reality of science is the product of human spirit (unique capacity of human creativity) which is the cause of the human impulse and the genuine interest in solving important problems. Similarly, the true source of religion is God and not culture. Humans are spiritual beings, and in every age, material and spiritual civilizations, based on their exigencies required a new spiritual impulse (teachings), based on that requirement, God has sent new manifestation as intermediaries (e.g., Krishna, Buddha, Christ, Muhammad, Zoroaster, and several others including the most recent manifestation of God, Bahá’u’lláh) between himself and humanity. It was these new teachings that in fact gave birth to cultures and civilizations and not the other way around.",

Belief and faith in both science and religion are to be based on proof and evidence and logical reasoning. Moreover, I never stated that religion and science are the same thing. But difference and division are two totally different things. We have millions of DIFFERENT plant and animal species, but they are all intimately linked and united around the concept of existence and the web of life. True science and true religion are two different knowledge sources, but they are also intimately linked and united with human existence which has two dimensions, i.e., material and spiritual.\n\nHuman beings may be the product of cultures, but founders of world religions are the ones that set the foundations of those cultures. The problem is, humans also add their own stuff to this culture, one of which is blind imitation or following of authorities, namely the political and religious leaders. This is the part where they cause the issues. People, following the leaders of “that part of the man-made cultures” which advocate a blind following, and this is why a man in India would most likely end up being a Hindu, and in Tibet a Buddhist, and in Saudi Arabia a Muslim, and in the west a Christian, and so on. But it is a big mistake to assume that religion is the product of culture, when it’s the other way around——religions are what created cultures in the first place. In fact, all civilizations were initially marked by the arrival of a new manifestation of God. It is their teachings that provide the first impulse and eventually produce new advances in arts, musics, architecture, sciences, law, ethics and philosophy. Without those divine educators, we would still be on the trees with the great apes picking fleas out of our hairs——there would be no culture, no industry, and no civilization.",
