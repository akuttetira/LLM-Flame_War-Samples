    "post_text ": "This idea of Jesus sacrificing himself (or God sacrificing him) for our sins seems to be a big deal in Christianity but I can't figure out why. What is the relationship between the original sin of humanity and Jesus being crucified?\n\nExplain to me how this works\n\n1. Humans are sinful\n2. Jesus is crucified\n3. ?\n4. Humans are saved\n\nIf God wants humans to be saved why does he need to go through this convoluted process of sending a guy (whose also himself) to earth to talk with humans and then get killed by them?\n\nIf you consider the narrative of the bible as a whole it just seems so obvious that this is a primitive desert cult making things up as it goes along. The fact that millions of educated modern people still believe in this is just so absurd.\n\nThis question also applies more broadly to any religion where gods are characters in a drama with humans. How can you believe in this stuff when the sociological explanation for why people would come up with that story makes so much more intuitive sense?",

We became unrighteous, and God cannot allow unrighteousness into Heaven. He could have left us alone, but He didn't. He loves us and wants us to be with Him.\n\nThis is the part that makes no sense at all. God can choose to change any of these facts. He can make humans not have free will. He could give us free will but make us not be capable of sin, the same way we're not capable of flying or telepathy. He could make it so that sin doesn't make us unrighteous, or he could allow unrighteous people into heaven. God made the rules, and he can change the rules, if he doesn't like the outcome.\n\nAnd that's setting aside that humans did not choose to sin. Adam and Eve didn't know what sin was, didn't know right from wrong. They didn't know that it was wrong to disobey God. Further, God put the serpent in the Garden. If I were in a perfect Garden, build by a perfect God, I too would assume that a talking snake I found there was there because God wanted it there, and that I could trust it.\n\nSo this entire set up makes no sense from top to bottom. It reads like a toddler trying to explain to his parents why he broke a lamp: it just fundamentally misunderstands morality at every step.\n\n>So from the beginning, He set His plan in motion to send His Son to die for us, and we can see this all throughout the Old Testament.

Now, all we must do is accept Christ as our Savior, and we can be cleansed in the eyes of God in order to attain salvation and go to Heaven for eternity.\n\nI'm sorry, but this is just childish. Justice requires that the person who did the wrong thing feel remorse, and that they restore the victim to wholeness, so that the wrong never happened. No part of Jesus's sacrifice accomplished those things. You cannot achieve justice by punishing the wrong person. You can't achieve justice at all through punishment alone. And if we had the power to make someone feel remorse without physical punishment, we'd be ethically obligated to do so. Surely God could appear before me this moment and, while respecting my free will, present me with evidence that I have sinned and should feel remorse. I'm a pretty rational guy and I value honestly and personal growth, so I would welcome such an interaction with God.\n\nNo, the crucifixion is orthogonal to justice at best, and an evil thing at worst.\n\nAnd remember, God makes the rules. God can just decree that our sins are redeemed. He has that power. There's no need to torture Jesus. Indeed, it is evil to torture anyone when it isn't necessary.\n\n>For the historicity, it was far more than a \"desert cult making things up\".

There is no evidence of darkness, no contemporary writings, and no contemporary secular affirmations of any part of Jesus's life other than a few possible indica of a Rabbi Joshua at approximately the right time, but even that evidence is hardly conclusive. In reality, we know that the history in the Gospels is wrong in several places. So rather than being confirmed, we know that parts of it *didn't* happen.",

Suffering *isn't* good in and of itself.\n\nAnd we also return to the idea that God makes the rules. A God who demands pain as sacrifice to his glory is an evil God. That's what sadists do. The idea of asking someone I love to suffer so that I can forgive them is repellent to me. It makes me feel soiled to even contemplate asking my wife, say, to suffer in order to make up for some wrong she has done me. And she's an equal. Demanding someone subservient to me to suffer is even worse! It is the job of a leader, a parent, a superior to protect their charges from harm, not to demand payment from them. The symbolic act of the payment of suffering to one's lord is evil. It's literally a recreation of Roman slavery, and later of medieval serfdom, which was a form of slavery.",

That part of your argument simply lacks logic.\n\nI have limitations now. I will myself to fly. I will myself to be invisible. I will myself to travel in time. None of it works. But we rightly don't think of those things as lacking free will. If God had limited us from rape just like he limited us from turning invisible, that would be no different and we'd still have free will.\n\nIn fact, I cannot rape or kill, now. I feel ill even at the thought of doing such things. I would certainly die before committing those acts if you put a gun to my head and commanded me to perform them. But I still have free will. I can make my choices, withing the things that I can still choose from. It is gibberish to suggest that God could not add things to list of actions we cannot perform without violating our free will.\n\n>God is perfect, just, pure, holy, and righteous. He therefore cannot simply say that sin is okay, because it is absolutely contrary to His nature. Likewise, He cannot simply allow unrighteousness into Heaven. Simply put, He cannot change the rules because we chose to sin.\n\nThat's circular logic. God can change what it means to be righteous. Or rather, God could have chosen different things to be righteous in the first place.\n\n>Adam and Eve had instructions. They were not to eat from the Tree of Knowledge, God had explicitly told them this. When Satan tempted them, he tempted them by saying it wouldn't really be so bad, and asked why would God not want them to eat from it. The serpent was clearly speaking contradictory to God, and they absolutely knew what they were doing because that was the exact thing God explicitly told them not to do.\n\nWithout knowing good from bad, they cannot know that it's wrong to disobey God. They cannot know that God is good, even, without having already eaten the Fruit.\n\n>You don't understand justice, do you? I haven't the foggiest where you got that definition. Someone doesn't have to feel remorse in order for justice to be served, and even after justice has been served, victims are not always restored to wholeness as if the wrong never occurred. This is simply an illogical way to view justice.\n\nCan you offer another way? You don't actually say what I get wrong or what some better way is. And yes, I agree that justice isn't often achieved. I think justice is probably impossible to achieve. That doesn't mean we shouldn't try or that partial restoration of the victim isn't better than no restoration. One thing you and can agree on is that humans aren't perfect, so we have to do the best we can.\n\n>And surely since you are a rational guy you feel bad when you do something such as lie, or are mean to someone? If so, that is God's way of letting you know you did wrong. If not, that's another problem in itself.\n\nI sincerely hope that you don't need God to tell you that lying is wrong (most of the time). If you think you would murder and rape and steal if not for the Word and love of God, then you are a danger to yourself and others and should immediately go and have yourself committed. I'm serious. That is a horrible, unbearable, insane thing to think and you deserve to get the help you need to learn how to tell right from wrong on your own.\n\n>It was absolutely necessary for the atonement to occur through the blood sacrifice of Christ, as blood is the life essence and we see this throughout the Old Testament in animal sacrifices. Notice how we are not required to do that anymore? That is because Christ was the perfect sacrifice for all.\n\nThat doesn't make any sense. Again, God makes the rules. Why did he want animal sacrifices? If anyone asks you to murder an animal for them, and you aren't a literal butcher, call the police on them. They are evil. A good person doesn't ask you to harm animals to glorify them. That's what serial killers do. It's truly alarming to me that you are defending the idea of God needing blood. That's evil. I don't know how else to say it. If you aren't repulsed by the idea of asking for someone's blood as payment for attornment, then you need psychiatric help. A perfect God cannot and does not ask for blood sacrifice, ever. How does blood help God? Why doesn't God care about the pain and suffering of the goat? I care about that pain and suffering, and surely God isn't less moral than I am? No, blood sacrifice is evil and it's only in the Bible because the Bible was written thousands of years ago by humans who didn't know better. We know better now.\n\n>Pertaining to the latter portion, claiming the need for contemporaneous writings is one of the weakest possible arguments one can give to refute documentation for anything. We don't have contemporaneous writings of many ancient figures, such as Pythagoras or even Emperor Nero, yet no one seems to question their existence. That is a null point to make. This also shows you have not done proper research. Greek and Roman historians documented the three hours of darkness from official archives. Some even attempted to explain away what occurred, yet it was quite literally impossible for any natural occurrence to have caused this.\n\nNo, you're laughably ignorant about the historical process if you think that. We have contemporaneous evidence for Nero. And we do question whether or not Pythagoras existed. Historians question basically every aspect of Pythagoras's life, and readily admit that we don't know anything about him for sure. We question the existence even of Nero, although not very seriously. The evidence for him is very strong. But of course we still don't know how much we actually know about him: we question all the major events of his life and any historian will tell you that ancient sources were often biased. We know that much of what was written about Nero was political lies, for instance, and some of the main work historians do is to try to read through the lies and determine fact from fiction.\n\nSo no, the lack of contemporaneous sources is a big problem. No one claims that Nero did anything that humans don't do today. If you are going to claim that miracles happen, you need extraordinary evidence. Much stronger evidence than we have for the existence of Nero.",

The comparison is baseless.\n\nI've been interested in Chinese gods/religion since meeting my wife ~15 years ago. Up until she moved to Hong Kong she had no idea what a god was, people in her city (including her parents) had no religious beliefs, not even the concept of a god. I've read multiple papers on the genesis of their early beliefs done in a historical context, not trying to shoehorn it into another belief system.",

We have evidence that the ancient Chinese did indeed at one point worship the God of the Bible, so it is not as if they absolutely had no idea. Moreover, there are many Chinese who have studied these and other writings and even today conclude they were referencing Christ.",

So I’ll copy it and paste .\n\nHow are you linking #1 to Jesus? What year was that and how did you form such a conclusion .\n\nThe work of thallus has been lost and is only quoted by a man named Julius. Therefore we don’t know what thallus said outside of a quote that says he saw an eclipse. So how do you form the conclusion the eclipse was during what the Bible says.",
