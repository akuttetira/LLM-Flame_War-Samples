    "post_text ": "I've never understood why intervening in rape, slavery murder, mass killings, famine, hunger, child abuse, child exploitation, genocide, poverty, natural disasters, war, mental illnesses, cancer, other diseases, oppression, ethnic and communal violence, etc, would somehow make God a \"cosmic tyrant\" but intervening in humanity building a tower by purposely putting mass confusion and enmity between all of human kind somehow DOESN'T.\n\nWho was the Tower of Babel actually hurting?\n\nIs building a tower worse than the high amounts of rape and sexual violence?\n\nIs building a tower more harmful to humans than the various genocides, both in history and still ongoing?\n\nIs building a tower more harmful to humans than widespread epidemics?\n\nIs building a tower more harmful to humans than frequent mass shootings?\n\nIs building a tower more harmful to humans than widespread slavery?\n\nIs building a tower more harmful to humans than rampant and widespread child abuse and child explanation?\n\nIs building a tower more harmful than mass destruction from bombs and other weapons?\n\nIs building a tower more harmful to humans than widespread mental illnesses, including psychopathy?\n\nIs building a tower more harmful to humans than various birth defects?\n\nIs building a tower more harmful to humans than religious extremism?\n\nIs building a tower more harmful to humans than fascism and oppressive or authoritarian governments?\n\nIs building a tower more harmful to humans than repeated war?\n\nIs building a tower more harmful to humans than widespread war crimes and the killing and torturing of civilians?\n\nIs building a tower more harmful to humans than widespread bigotry?\n\nIs building a tower more harmful to humans than mass injustice?\n\nIs building a tower more harmful to humans than widespread ethnic and communal clashes and ethnic violence?\n\nIn fact, the various communication barriers and lack of human unity and cooperation actually plays an active role in many of the above. That means that if the story did happen to take place, this incident of God's intervention actually permanently caused massive amounts of grievous harm and destruction to all of human kind, and led to many of the problems we are seeing today.\n\nWho exactly was confusing our language and putting humanity at odds with each other supposed to help?\n\nWas humanity not exercising their free will to build the Tower of Babel?\n\nWhy would God intervening in all the other cases make Him a \"cosmic tyrant\" (even after numerous people praying for intervention in each of those cases) but Him intervening in this particular case somehow doesn't?",

Imagine if nothing new came from The Tower and an evil tyrant does something to destroy it. Not only is civilization gone, but others that'll survive would probably have nothing else to look forward to. They likely knew of God beforehand, so confusing their language and still finding common ground (some nations creating false gods with the corrupted traits of The True Father God 'YHWH') shows that something Spiritual was at work greater than the physical task they were attempting.\n\nNow I don't know if what I've said before and now are correct, so may God forgive me if I mention these things in error.\n\nGenesis has \"Then to Adam He said, “Because you have heeded the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree of which I commanded you, saying, ‘You shall not eat of it’: “Cursed is the ground for your sake; In toil you shall eat of it All the days of your life\".\n\nAlthough the ground is cursed, it mentions that it is \"for thy sake.\" Perhaps some things seemingly harmful have to be done for our Salvation.",

The pursuit of improvement cannot meaningfully continue forever- it can only succeed, fail, dwindle to nothing, or loop.

Imagine all the trading between different nations for resources only found in there respective areas. The different mindset of this country may have helped another make progress and vice versa. Think about finding attributes similar to those attached to God in the beliefs of Native Americans. Sharing food dishes all over the world and making new recipes with native spices could've been lost.\n\nThe reason that you can be an atheist giving your opinion to a Christian on something called Reddit is because what they \"suffered\" actually brought the world together for something much more important than fearing to explore the world and sometimes being on our own. To me, the part about \"nothing will be impossible\" is that if they're scared to scatter, then another fear will creep in, too. In the end, they'll just have a Prison instead of a strong Tower because being shielded from the unknown and not taking chances seems to be on their minds.\n\nRemember that they could've still built the tower, but it seems that understanding a language is all it took to break them up. Today, we constantly work with people of different beliefs, backgrounds, ethnicities, languages, and all. You have engineers from different backgrounds working together to send objects into space, so imagine if they believed that a tower was the epitome of human achievements. So many things are taken for granted now, so it is expected that what God did is unappreciated just like how the Hebrews behaved after being freed from agonizing slavery and nourished even in The Wilderness. As crazy as it seemed, some even wanted to go back to Egypt.\n\nNumbers 14:1-12, \"Then all the congregation raised a loud cry, and the people wept that night. 2 And all the people of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron. The whole congregation said to them, “Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! Or would that we had died in this wilderness! 3 Why is the Lord bringing us into this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will become a prey. Would it not be better for us to go back to Egypt?” 4 And they said to one another, “Let us choose a leader and go back to Egypt.”\n5 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the people of Israel. 6 And Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had spied out the land, tore their clothes 7 and said to all the congregation of the people of Israel, “The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceedingly good land. 8 If the Lord delights in us, he will bring us into this land and give it to us, a land that flows with milk and honey. 9 Only do not rebel against the Lord. And do not fear the people of the land, for they are bread for us. Their protection is removed from them, and the Lord is with us; do not fear them.” 10 Then all the congregation said to stone them with stones. But the glory of the Lord appeared at the tent of meeting to all the people of Israel.\n11 And the Lord said to Moses, “How long will this people despise me? And how long will they not believe in me, in spite of all the signs that I have done among them? 12 I will strike them with the pestilence and disinherit them, and I will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they.”",

As far as I know, other independent flood stories don't include killing all life on Earth except the contents of an ark because they were apparently evil. The Chinese flood myth talks about taming the waters.",
