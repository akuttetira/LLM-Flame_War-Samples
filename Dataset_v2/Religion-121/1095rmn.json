    "post_text ": "Many, if not most, religious people wouldn't be religious if they applied the same standards of evidence they do for most other things (Changed from everything because people still believe in stupid things) to their own religion.\n\nIf I were to claim that I was from the future and that I need $10,000 to fix my time machine and I will pay you $100,000 once I return home. You probably wouldn't believe me. Yet religious people believe in something that makes thousands of more assumptions than that with no evidence.\n\nTake, for example, the claim that Jesus Christ is the son of God. There is no evidence for this beyond SUPPOSEDLY some witnesses of him doing things that could be considered miracles. Yet many Christians would believe this while dismissing my claim of being a time traveller. If they had consistent standards of evidence that they applied to both claims then they would either: Not believe that Jesus is the son of God, or believe that I am a time traveller. The fact that this isn't the case is illogical.\n\nIf you are one of the people who would believe me, then please send me 10,000USD because I'm trapped in the past, your present, and want to go home to my daughter. For proof, I inform you that there will come a time when there is a female US president.",
