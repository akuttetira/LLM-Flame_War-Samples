    "post_text ": "To my mind, anything that women are expected to do that men aren’t purely due to their gender, is in itself sexist. Why does the debate need to go any further than this? I genuinely do not understand the other side of the argument as to how it is not oppressive to women. \n\nPS I do not agree with the banning of it, despite my view. People should be able to wear what they want no matter what it is or represents. I just don’t understand how the head scarf in any of its forms does not derive from a place of misogyny, even when women say it is their choice to wear it.\n\nAlso, I am not referring to when women are forced to wear it - that is objectively misogynistic if only women are forced to. What I don’t understand is why women would chose to wear something that their male counter parts don’t, unless they believe that their own God is a misogynist who believes that women need to cover up but men don’t.",

Public places should be safe for everyone, esp from harassments, rape and else. So let me propose that we cut off all men's dicks since that would effectively reduce rape statistics. If women are expected to give up their right and freedom to wear whatever they want and be oppressed, why not switch it up the other way? Or pluck out all men's eyes? That way men could free up public spaces of their temptation which is the root cause of the problem rather than shift the onus of the blame to the victims.",

Do you condone slavery? Do you think it was back then the right thing to do, and you wouldn't mind if that practice was brought back?
