    "Post_Title": "The arguments that Muslim apologists put forth in regards to Aisha’s age are weak and often based on falsehoods",
    "post_text ": "\n\nMy thesis argument is that many Muslims acknowledge the fact that child marriage is an unjustifiable act and representative of a primitive, archaic moral system that is incompatible in this day and age. When confronted with the idea that Prophet Muhammad himself practiced this with his marriage to Aisha, they come up with arguments that are not based in reality and are untruthful and based on contradictory value systems.\n\n\nAisha was 6 when Muhammad asked her father, Abu Bakr, (also his closest friend) to marry her after having a dream of an angel carrying a young girl covered in a blanket and bringing her to him when he lifted the veil, he saw that it was Aisha. He interpreted this dream as a command from Allah to marry her. When he proposed the marriage to her, she remained silent and Muhammad said “her silence is her consent”. Aisha then moved into Muhammad’s house when she was 9, which is when the marriage was consummated. A 53 year old Muhammad had raped a 9 year old girl\n\nWhere do the reports that Aisha married Muhammad when she was 6 come from? They come from Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim. Sahih Bukhari is the second most important book in Islam after the Quran, and the most authentic book of hadiths, Sahih Muslim is also considered the most authentic and trusted book of hadiths. A very large part of Islamic history, tradition, rules, laws, jurisprudence stems from these two books. Not only is her age being 6 when she was married  said explicitly in Bukhari and Muslim, but other books in the Kutub al Sitah (which is the 6 most authentic books of hadiths in Islam) Which is why it annoys me so much when Muslim apologists say that the hadiths that say Aisha was 6 are weak hadiths in an attempt to trick laymen and unknowledgeable people, when the exact opposite is true. The hadiths that say Aisha was 6 are considered authentic/trusted. I will post them in the comments https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/nqkv7h/the_arguments_that_muslim_apologists_put_forth_in/h0b8462/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3\n\nAnother trick that Muslim apologists employ is that they downplay the significance of the hadiths and claim hadiths in general are just unreliable as they were compiled many years after the death of Muhammad. They claim hadiths are just secondary Islamic sources and not as authoritative, definitive, or significant in Islam. That is a complete and utter falsehood, it is so laughably false, because there is a 99.9999% chance that the same people saying that do actually believe in the hadiths and recognize the hadiths significance in Islam, but are just saying that to save face. Also the Quran was complied into one text many years after the death of Muhammad too and were a compilation of many verses written on rocks to leaves over the course of 20 years, and Qurans with different Arabic dialects were discarded in n favour of one Arabic dialect\n\nThe Quran is actually a quite shallow book and reveals virtually zero personal details about Muhammad or his companions as the Quran is only what Allah was saying to Muhammad depending on the circumstances Muhammad was in. The way Muslims pray, the stories of the end times, Islamic rituals, all the battles that Muhammad participated in, his interactions with his companions, all the major stories in Islam, the personal life and details of Muhammad come from hadiths. The majority of Islamic law is derived from hadiths and the seerah. You cannot have Islam without the hadiths. Period. 99% of Muhammad’s life is discovered through the hadiths and seerah. You wouldn’t know 99% of Muhammad’s life by going with the Quran alone.\n\nPeople who only take the Quran into consideration and reject the authority of hadiths are considered infidels by almost all Islamic scholars. But even then Quran 65:4 is a clear indication that child marriages are permitted in Islam, as it states that girls who have not yet menstruated have a waiting period of 3 months before they remarry\n\nSome Muslim apologists say there are some hadiths that say Aisha was actually 12/14/18 at the time of the narriage: THIS IS FALSE. There is no hadith out there that EXPLICITLY say that Aisha was 12 or 14 or 18 at the time of the marriage. Some Muslim apologists have deduced Aisha’s age from certain hadiths, but no hadiths explicitly say that.\n\nHowever, there are 20+ hadiths that explicitly state that Aisha was 6 and played with dolls and sat on the lap of Muhammad, all of them authentic and trusted or that she was a young girl or allude/imply that she was very young\n\nThe 3 other arguments Muslim apologists use are: 1) Aisha’s sister, Asma was 10 years older than Aisha, and from a hadith that states the date of her death and the age at which she died, we can determine Aisha’s birth year , and hence that Aisha was 18 at the time of the marriage . The issue here is that this report is considered inauthentic/untrustworthy/weak by Islamic scholars and the text from which this report came from is discarded and considered unreliable by Islamic scholars. Ironic because Muslim apologists say that the hadiths that say Aisha was 6 are weak hadiths, but they are actually using weak hadiths themselves. Look up ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Abī al-Zinād, the one who authored Asmas biography and Islamic scholars’ opinions on him and whether or not his work is authentic \n\n2) Muhammad’s daughter Fatima was 5 years older than Aisha, and using the birth year of Fatima as a reference point and adding 5 yrs to it to get Aisha’s birth year, we can determine Aisha was actually 12 at the time of the marriage. The issue here is this: There are 2 reports, one says that Fatima was born in the year of 605, and another separate report that says she was born in 611 and she was 5 years older than Aisha. What Muslim apologists did was they used the first report that Fatima was born in the year of 605 and then inserted that she was 5 years older than Aisha, when the first report did not say Fatima was 5 years older than Aisha. They deceptively inserted the second contradictory report with the first one to make Aishas age older. The second report would actually make Aisha’s age out to be 4 years old when she was married rather than 6\n\n3) Aisha participated in a battle shortly after their marriage  and Muhammad only allowed people 15 or older to participate in battles, so Aisha was actually 13/14 at the time of the marriage. The issue is that Aisha was not a combatant in the battle, she was acting as a nurse, so the minimum age of 15 did not apply to her.\n\nOther notes: Muhammad married a 17 year old Saafiya when he was 58, a 19 year old Hafsa when he was 53, a 20 year old Juwariya when he was 57, and married all of his daughters off before or at the age of 10, which further proves Muhammad was okay with this kind of stuff of marrying women much younger than him",

            "Reply_Text": "This comment will have 2 parts since the max is 10000 words or so...\n\nThis is a complete refutation of this Aisha's marriage issue. hang on tight. I will be using Western academics and historians to establish basic fact.\n\nFirst of all, if you are going to make a argument, do not make up lies or misrepresent the facts.\n\nThe majority of Muslims agree that the marriage between the Prophet alayhi salatu wa salam and his wife, Aisha bint Abu Bakr radiallahu anha happened when Aisha was 6 and the consummation when Aisha was 9-10, 9 most likely. On top of this, in Islam a father can marry off his daughter in Sharia before she reaches the age of puberty. What does this mean? It means that on records, there is a marriage, not in practice since in Islamic Sharia, **sex with anyone that has not reached puberty is forbidden.**\n\nSo, what is the issue here? The problem is with people like you oh OP that have a really incorrect and frankly very naive understanding of marriage in human history and the age of consent.\n\nIn short: What you define as a child, someone up to 15 year old or even 16 in some countries is **subjective.**\n\nSo in other words, you are trying to shove down your societies definition of a child on to other countries which results to inconsistency and dishonesty. For example:\n\nHere in Finland, the age of consent is 16. So a 16 year old can consent to sex by law. Mkay, fair enough.\n\nIn Denmark, its 15...\n\nin Italy, its 14........\n\nIn Turkey is 18, in Ireland its 17. This is far from Italy's law regarding consent.\n\nThis is just here in Europe in the 21 century. So someone in Turkey that has been raised to believe that sex with a 16 year old is absolutely forbidden would go nuts if they went to Italy and they heard anyone having sex with a 14 year old without being punished by law. To them its a child. Here in Finland the people would react the same.\n\nSo if your own societies morality and ethics and laws can't travel with you to another country in the 21 century, **then how on earth are you going to apply YOUR standards of what you consider to be a child to a 7th century society in Arabia??** This is not only illogical, but ridiculous and i will refute this whole idea. Also, as OP is building his argument based on a HAdith, lets quote Aisha radiallahu anah herself regarding this:\n\n\"At-Tirmidhi said: ‘Aa’ishah said: **When a girl reaches the age of nine years, she is a woman.**\nSunan at-Tirmidhi (2/409) \"\n\nNOTE: Aisha radiallahu anha was not prepubescent at the age of 9, she had definitely reached the age of puberty which was a very common age to get married in human history to begin with. In reality, most European countries started their reform in the 20th century regarding these laws. On top of that, **she was a adult in 7th Arabia and not a child.**\n\nOne more thing, OP made up a lie:\n\n>When he proposed the marriage to her, she remained silent and Muhammad said “her silence is her consent”\n\nWhat? Lets refute this shall we:\n\nThe Prophet alayhi salatu wa salam was ASKED by **Khawlah bint Hakim** radiallahu anha if he wished to marry Aisha radiallahu anha. The Prophet also saw a dream about her that he was going to marry her.\n\n\"She was the woman who asked the Prophet whether he would like to marry any woman after the death of Khadijaa, as he had loved Khadija dearly.\n\n\n\nAfter the consent of the Prophet, she conveyed the message to Sawda bint Zama (widow of Sakran bin Amr) and Abu Bakr for his daughter Aisha's hand in marriage.\"\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khawlah\\_bint\\_Hakim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khawlah_bint_Hakim)\n\nThe hadith OP mentions about a Woman's silence is her consent is a completely different narration where Aisha herself ask the Prophet alayhi salatu wa salam:\n\n\"Narrated \\`Aisha:\nI asked the Prophet, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Should the women be asked for their consent to their marriage?\" He said, \"Yes.\" I said, \"A virgin, if asked, feels shy and keeps quiet.\" He said, \"Her silence means her consent.\"\n\n[https://sunnah.com/bukhari/89/7](https://sunnah.com/bukhari/89/7)\n\nSo OP, don't make up lies.\n\n1/2 Continuing ----------------->",

It doesn’t matter how many societies believed the opposite, it doesn’t make it right.\n\nIf you are arguing that whether a nine year old is a “child” and thus whether having sex with her is fine or not is subjective then you are straight up defending pedophilia. The exact year limit to a child can be debated (whether it should be 17, 18, 16, 19, etc.) but it is pretty obvious a *9 year old* is a child.\n\nAnd here is another thing:\n\nIf Muhammad was a normal dude, we could have tolerate such behavior since asking him to question his time’s morality is too much for him (and for most people).\n\nBut Muhammad is morally perfect just like every other prophet, if he does an act it is either morally neutral or good. Which mean marrying a 6 year old is either morally neutral or good, right?\n\nIf marrying a 6 year old is actually wrong, this means Muhammad sinned which is not possible.\n\nYou are literally saying “The man that came upon the world to change his people’s wrong sense of morality with the guidance of a *literal God* couldn’t know that pedophilia is wrong.” which doesn’t really make sense. Muhammad came to change people’s wrong beliefs, not to continue doing that.",

Well, today a 18 year old is usually clueless about the basic aspects of their society. They still have school, they are not independent, they probably don't own a thing.

A 18 year old is mentally mature enough to decide whether they wanna have a relationship with other people, they don’t need to know literally everything yet. Of course they will be less mature than people older than them but that doesn’t matter, they are mature *enough*.\n\nGoing to college does not make someone immature neither still getting help from (probably) their parents, neither not having their own things (which most have anyway but whatever).\n\nMaturity is not about having money, a job, not going to school, etc. it is about who you are.

That is the why philosophy of ethics exists, so we can have a rational discussion about what is right and wrong. You can’t just say it is your opinion so it doesn’t matter what you say even if your argument is sound. My argument is based on reason, I don’t claim pedophilia is wrong just because I feel like it, I say it is wrong because it is the rational conclusion.\n\nIf we go by your logic saying “Murder is wrong.” is “just my opinion” so it is not really wrong.\n\n>Atheist doesn't even believe in objective morality to begin with so there is nothing you can state regarding other peoples morality.\n\nWhere did you made that up? Just do some research please, I am not here to be a teacher.\n\nAnd even if I say you are right. It doesn’t matter. Because according to Islam objective morality exists and I just need to show that it’s own morality doesn’t make sense. I can say “If objective morality existed it wouldn’t be how Islam claimed it to be which means Islam’s version of objective morality is wrong.”, notice how I don’t need objective morality to actually exist to make my argument work?\n\n>You can't even argue against Italy that has the age of consent down at 14 let alone about 7th century Arabia.\n\nI can. Easily.\n\n>Until you realize this, this discussion is pointless.\n\nUntil you realize that just because people can’t have a consensus about what is the right age for consent doesn’t mean there is no right age, this discussion is pointless.

You don't even know what IS good or bad morality without having a objective morality. Do you? If so then that should be established.\n\nHow the hell did you “prove” that non Muslim morality is subjective? By showing that non Muslims disagree with each other?\n\nIf that’s so, look: Just because there is disagreement does not mean there is not objective answer. People throughout history debated whether the Earth is round or not, some said it is some said it isn’t. Does that make my belief that the Earth is round “subjective” since other societies had different opinions? Of course not. That is not how subjective and objective works, different opinions does not necessarily mean no one is being objective.\n\n>Seriously, if you think you can make sense with your comments, at least comprehend this.\n\nSays the guy who can’t comprehend the idea that a nine fucking year old is not mature enough for sex.\n\n>So again, who is right and who is wrong? Answer this if you have objective basis for your morality, if not then admit that you have subjective morality and then you can finally comprehend your position the way it really is.\n\nI explained why I am right.\n\nA nine year old is not mature body wise because: It’s body can be damaged by sex since it’s body is still developing.\n\nA nine year old is not mature brain wise because: It is the same reason it is not mature enough to discuss politics, philosophy, etc.\n\n>You made a CLAIM, not a argument. A assertion, not a argument. You made a statement with no basis other than the fact that it is subjective i.e.  your opinion.\n\nI have literally been trying to explain why I think what I think right now throughout my entire comments. And you say it is just a claim? Are serious?\n\n>I made a CLAIM as well which is based on a fact. This fact is that you don't have any objective basis to call anyone's morality immoral. This is a fact, if you disagree then bring your objective morality and prove it that its objective.\n\nI see, you are claiming that an atheist can’t have objective morality. Well, nearly all of philosophers disagree with you. Just do some research and you’ll see. If you want me to explain then that would force us to get way deep into moral philosophy and I don’t have the time and also it is not like you want to learn anything that doesn’t support your claims anyway.\n\n>Forget about what i said, you already admitted that it is your opinion. Then you claimed its a right opinion. Amazing. So why is your opinion more important than someone else's opinion?\n\nI agreed that it is an opinion since the beginning.\n\nLook. Let me explain how an opinion can be better than others:\n\nLet’s say my opinion is that the Earth is round and someone else’s opinion is that it is flat. My opinion is still right, understand?\n\n> You don't seem to comprehend that a OPINION by definition is and i quote:\n\n>\"the ideas that a person or a group of people have about something or someone, which are based mainly on their feelings and beliefs, or a single idea of this type\n\n>a view or judgement formed about something, not necessarily based on fact or knowledge.\"\n\n>https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/opinion\n\n>So its irrelevant, it is not a fact, it is a opinion.\n\nAs you yourself shown there are different definitions. The definition I use was “a thought or belief about something or someone” which does not mean an opinion is necessarily subjective. Some opinions are subjective like apples’ being tasty but some are objective like the Earth being round.\n\nYou yourself showed that an opinion is not necessarily subjective and then cherry picked the definition you wanted so you can look right. Are you serious? And you even failed at that, second definition you quoted was “a view or judgement formed about something, not necessarily based on fact or knowledge”. This says an opinion is not necessarily objective which just means that it can sometimes be subjective too. It doesn’t say it can’t be objective. You even failed at cherry-picking.\n\n>The world does not run on opinions.\n\n>A opinion is not based on rationality, its based on FEELINGS, It lacks logic, it lacks basic common sense.\n\nJust read the definitions you wrote first. But just in case you fail at even at that, I’ll show you some definitions your own source uses:\n\n- a thought or belief about something or someone\n\n- the thoughts or beliefs that a group of people have\n\n- a judgment made by an expert\n\n- the ideas that a person or a group of people have about something or someone, which are based mainly on their feelings and beliefs, or a single idea of this type\n\nOnly the last definition indicates an opinion is subjective by necessity which is not the definition I meant to use in the first place.\n\n>You speak about having rational discussions and philosophy of ethics while none of these concepts rely on someone shoving their opinions on others.\n\nThe whole point of discussions is so people can exchange opinions.\n\n>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics\n\nI just find it funny that you just linked a Wikipedia page about ethics while the page itself does not contain anything that contradicts me.\n\n>I gave you evidence, i gave you clear cut historical evidence and even modern laws on age of consent in Europe and my argument relies on these, not on my feelings and emotions.\n\n>Take it or leave it.\n\nYou just showed me that the age of consent differs from time and place. This does not mean there is no right age of consent. How did you make that conclusion?",

The first recorded age-of-consent law dates from 1275 in England; as part of its provisions on rape, the Statute of Westminster 1275 made it a misdemeanor to \"ravish\" a \"maiden within age,\" whether with or without her consent. The phrase \"within age\" was later interpreted by jurist Sir Edward Coke (England, 17th century) **as meaning the age of marriage, which at the time was twelve years of age.\\[5\\]\"**\n\n\nRobertson, Stephen. \"Age of Consent Laws (Teaching Module)\"\n\n\n3. \"A general shift in social and legal attitudes toward issues of sex occurred during the modern era. Attitudes on the appropriate age of permission for females to engage in sexual activity drifted toward adulthood. While ages **from ten to thirteen years were typically regarded as acceptable ages for sexual consent in Western countries during the mid-19th century**,\\[1\\] by the end of the 19th century changing attitudes towards sexuality and childhood resulted in the raising of the age of consent.\\[5\\]\"\n\n\nWaites, Matthew (2005). The Age of Consent: Young People, Sexuality and Citizenship.\nRobertson, Stephen. \"Age of Consent Laws (Teaching Module)\"\n\n\n4. \" In the United States, as late as the 1880s most states set the minimum age at **ten to twelve (in Delaware, it was seven in 1895**).\\[9\\] Inspired by the \"Maiden Tribute\" articles, female reformers in the U.S. initiated their own campaign,\\[10\\] which petitioned legislators to raise the legal minimum age to at least sixteen, with the ultimate goal to raise the age to eighteen. The campaign was successful, with almost all states raising the minimum age to sixteen to eighteen years by 1920.\\[5\\]\\[11\\]\nIn France, Portugal, Denmark, the Swiss cantons and other countries, the minimum age was raised to between thirteen and sixteen years in the following decades.\\[5\\] Though the original arguments for raising the age of consent were based on morality, since then the raison d'être of the laws has changed to child welfare and a so-called right to childhood or innocence.\\[12\\]\nIn France, under the Napoleonic Code, the age of consent was set in 1832 at eleven,\\[13\\] and was raised to thirteen in 1863.\\[14\\] It was increased to fifteen in 1945.\\[15\\]\nIn Spain, it was set in 1822 at \"puberty age\", and changed to twelve in 1870,\\[16\\] which was kept until 1999, when it became 13;\\[17\\]\\[18\\] and in 2015 it was raised to 16.\\[19\\]\\[20\\]\\[21\\]\"\n\"Campaign to Raise the Legal Age of Consent, 1885–1914, Lesson Plan\".

Yes, the exact cutoff is subjective, but the cutoff is within a specific range for a reason.\n\nThe other thing to consider is that age difference matters because it introduces a power imbalance. Two 16 year olds is a different thing than a 16 year old and a 50 year old. There are people in happy relationships with an age difference but there are limits as to how large that difference can be before being a problem. I heard about a town in France where children used to get married. Their families arranged it, they would marry, stay with their parents, and then when they were older, they would live together and lead a maritial lifestyle. That's a not a big deal as far as history goes. A child marrying an adult is a big deal.",

The Prophet was doing nothing differently from what had been done throughout human history, including European history right up to the modern era.\n\nThat being said, I don't think you've resolved the moral issue here.  As a modern person, I think it is absolutely wrong for girls to consummate their marriage at the first sign of puberty.  They are physically unprepared for the inevitable result: it is far more risky to go through a pregnancy at the age of 10 or 12 than it is after the end of puberty, around 16-18.\n\nSo my question is - assuming you have succeeded in establishing the historical normalcy of child marriage, do you think you have also established its correctness?  Are you saying that the modern custom is actually wrong, and it would be right and proper for us to go back to having girls marry at 10-12?",

Generally in Islam, the signs of physical maturity have to be present for one to get married, have children...etc. This is why the general age is 15 when someone is definitely accountable and also able to marry. Before this is also possible, but just to be safe, its 15 and this does not apply on those who are not developed at 15 like guys that look like 13 at the age of 15 and so on.\n\nSo even though there is no set age, according to the scholars in 14 centuries (Ahl sunnah), the age is generally 15. It could be earlier or later as well, but Islamic Sharia never views the exceptions, but the general mass.\n\nSo no, i am not pro marrying 9-10 or even 12 year olds. I didn't put it out there, but exceptions are not the standard.\n\nStill, modern customs is wrong for advocating sex before marriage and this idea that sleeping around is OK, specially for teens. This is obviously another discussion though :D\n\nAlso, if a country doesn't allow any sexual contact with under 21 year olds, that is then a bit extreme since people are very developed physically at this point.",

(Child betrothal is a whole other issue.)\nSo how do we reconcile these 14 centuries of scholarly opinion with the Prophet's marriage to Aisha at 6 and consummation at 9?  With all due respect to your lengthy post, you haven't really addressed this.\n\nIf this is a matter of faith, then it is beyond my ability to judge.  Perhaps it is simply the case that the Prophet's vision indicated a direct divine command, which must be carried out without question.  Yet this does not seem to be what Muslims believe, because if it was, then there would be no need for arguments, scholarly debate, etc.  It seems that Muslims think there _is_ an explanation - but I am at a loss as to what it could be.\n\nIs it that Aisha had the physical development of a 15-year-old at the age of 9?  Or that fathers have the right to grant exceptions regarding their daughters?  Or something else?",
