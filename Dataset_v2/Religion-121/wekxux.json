    "post_text ": "The Sun lacks sentience but has a purpose - it is the source of all energy on Earth, indirectly responsible for all life on Earth and maintains all life. As well as this, its position is necessary to maintain the order in our solar system as it lies at the centre. Additionally, unlike the rest of the solar system, it’s self-sustaining and extremely long-lived, billions of years old. These are empirical and visible facts. Praising this (worshipping) is more understandable than praising an incomprehensible sentient entity that we have no direct evidence off beyond Holy Scripture and subjective miracles.",

My point was just so that you noticed you did. We can both do that but obviously to you it only counts when you do it. When I do it, it's fallacious.\n\n> None, there are none.\n\nMaybe you disagree with them, but to pretend they don't exist is nonsense. You mentioned the Kalam and say it is easily dismantled and only fools look at it and count it as evidence. However, it's been one of the most discussed arguments in philosophy. There have been back and forths on it for decades and people are still arguing today. Yet you can just handwave it away. Convenient.\n\n> Wow, indoctrinated people study what they're indoctrinated into?\n\nAgain, you can easily dismiss my appeal to authority, but when you do it, it counts.\n\n> People in history and now being religious has no bearing on its truth and only speaks to how dangerous it was to not be religious before we were enlightened. You're trapped in the dark ages.\n\nI guess all of these people are fools then? The fathers of modern science, all of the advanced science theists today? Just fools? But you, you have it totally figured out and completely proven (of which you've given no support that God can't exist)\n\n> Professional philosophers are not convinced by word games.\n\nAgain, the Kalam is still debated...atheist and theist philosophers are still debating this, same for plenty of other arguments.\n\n> The people born and raised in a religion who hold it tightly despite a godless world.\n\nSo all theistic scientists were just born and raised in it? You have any type of data to back that claim? Or just another assertion without evidence?\n\n[This article](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2009/11/05/scientists-and-belief/) (granted it's a little dated) states that:\n\n> According to the poll, just over half of scientists (51%) believe in some form of deity or higher power; specifically, 33% of scientists say they believe in God, while 18% believe in a universal spirit or higher power.\n\nBut again, who cares what percentage of scientists are theists. That doesn't change the fact that there are arguments based on science, like the argument from the applicability of mathematics, many cosmological arguments, the digital physics argument, etc.\n\n> You have christian in your flair, the entite basis for christianity is ancient folklore. You can try to lie and pretend but it's on display.\n\nI'm a Christian, I believe in the Bible. You said I believe ancient folklore proves magic is real to me. That's not true.
