    "post_text ": "I don't care how Christians defend, rationalize, or sugarcoat it; the Bible is infested with misogyny and sexism, and the man being the leader and final decision-maker in the household is sexist and misogynistic (and of course the Bible also instructs soldiers to take women home as newly acquired possessions, requires a rape victim to marry her rapist, among countless other sexist vile things).\n\nExample #1. [Christiancourier.com](https://Christiancourier.com) says \"These facts do not suggest that woman is inferior to man, but they do mean (to those who respect the testimony of Scripture) that she is subordinate in rank to man.\" \n\nUm, hello! 'Inferior' and 'subordinate' are synonyms. In other words, they mean the same thing!\n\nExample #2: Regarding how only men can be head pastors and church elders/deacons, and other forms of sexism in the Bible, [gotquestions.org](https://gotquestions.org) says \"It is also very important to understand that the Bible’s ascribing different roles to men and women does not constitute sexism. The Bible makes it abundantly clear that God expects men to take the leadership role in the church and the home. Does this make women inferior? Absolutely not. Does this mean women are less intelligent, less capable, or viewed as less in God’s eyes? Absolutely not! What it means is that in our sin-stained world, there has to be structure and authority. God has instituted the roles of authority for our good. Sexism is the abuse of the roles, not the existence of these roles.\" \n\nYeah, that adds up perfectly. -\\_- And gee, just maybe the existence of these roles, along with the \"fact\" that they're given by God himself, is exactly why they get abused and taken advantage of. After all, according to Christian doctrine each and every human being is infected with sin. Isn't that right?...\n\nExample #3: According to [carm.org](https://carm.org) \"Headship is not misogyny. In biblical theology the male represents the descendants (federal headship) and is the one who has responsibility of leadership. This is not a hatred for women. If anything, it is a protection for them. Furthermore, if it is misogynistic to say that the man is the head of a woman, then what do they say about God the Father being the head of Christ? Does it mean that God the Father hates his Son because he is his head? Of course not.\"\n\nSo reserving leadership for men only isn't misogynistic, but a way of protecting women. W...T...F?\n\nI'd also like to mention, that one reason I've heard for Eve being created from Adam's rib (one of countless Bible stories that rub me the wrong way) was for her to be at his side as his equal. His side to be his equal, not his head to be over him or his foot to be under him...but nevertheless \"the husband is the head of the wife (Ephesians 5:23)\" and therefore the household leader and final decision-maker. And only men can be head pastors and church elders (1 Timothy 2:11-14, 3:1-13; Titus 1:6-9). Makes lots of sense...",

Are we done here?\n\nWe see the same thing in nature and society.  Misogynistic is just an adjective that means \"not fair to my female group\" essentially.\n\nI don't even think you can argue that the Bible is *not* misogynistic.",

Jesus never once gave instruction for how to buy or punish slaves, commit genocide or anything of the sort.  And, war crimes?  Really?  I was unaware of the international Bronze Age code for conducting warfare and how POW's and civilians are to be treated.  Please enlighten me.\n\nThe problem with your interpretation, and all revisionist history for that matter is a complex one.\n\nYou cant sit on your computer or smart phone and view Anthropological subjects from millennia ago through the lens of 21st century progressivism.  All you do is turn everything into a philosophical debate about current vs past societies morality.\n\nAlso, when you do this, you fail to place the people and events into their correct context and you delude people with your false conclusions because of it. Its the univalent of fake news, or propaganda.\n\nIf we are going to debate an issue, we first have to agree what it is we are debating.  We have to create some kind of framework for discussion, statements, and rebuttal.\n\nAre we debating religion, morality, philosophy, historical events or what?  Your whole argument is basically this: \"The Bible is bad because I think it is misogynistic, violent, homophobic, and evil. Only I get to interpret the meanings of those words and how they get to be implied with no context\"\n\nThe Bible is Misogynistic.\n\nThe Bible is not homophobic (look up the definition of homophobic, it does not mean if it hurts your feelings its homophobic)  The Bible is not afraid of homosexuals, I promise you.\n\nThe Bible is not pro slavery, just the opposite.\n\nThe problem with dumbasses like you who try and debate religion with their own crusader agenda is this:\n\nYou have not even read the Bible, you don't understand the culture, context or interpretation of scripture, the original languages the texts where pend in, or the culture of the authors who penned it.  Basically, you do not know shit.\n\nYou cherry pick verses that have nothing to do with Moral law, and you try to compare actual Moral, ceremonial and judicial biblical law to the world in 2021.\n\nYour frightened by Christians?  Why?  Are you frightened because they believe in the power of prayer? Because they are compassionate and have done more outreach and aide work in the last 200 years than any other religion?  Is it the belief in forgiveness, being kind to your neighbor, slow to anger and abounding in love that scares you?  Is it the nuclear family values that have you shaking in your boots?  The respect for life and the belief that we are all created in the image of God and that we should not look down on others?\n\nNo, your not scared of Christians, you just hate the God of the bible and you hate Christ because He stands for everything that you don't stand for.\n\n\"You will know them by their fruits...\"\n\n\" not everyone who says Lord, Lord, will enter the Kingdom...\"\n\nNobody who is owning or punishing slaves, committing genocide, or war crimes is a Christian.",
