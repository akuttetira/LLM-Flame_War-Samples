    "post_text ": "Some people say \"oh, bad things happen because people are fallen and are mean to each other. It's not God's fault!\"\n\nBut people don't cause natural disasters. People don't cause birth defects. People don't cause childhood cancer.\n\nAll of that stuff could be nonexistent if an all-powerful, all-loving God was actually around to help people, and/or prevent such stuff existing in his creation. An all powerful God could easily create a universe in which it was a physical impossibility for cancers or illness to happen. But that's not the case. Free will has nothing to do with it (ignoring the fact that God gave no indication of respecting free will in the Bible, and several times actively worked against such a concept), Besides, clearly people suffering like this are not doing so willingly, so any \"free will\" argument in terms of that kind of suffering is ludicrous nonsense.\n\nI recently got an ad about a child with cancer, and watching the video honestly broke me. Seeing that little girl cry amidst her suffering, sobbing that she didn't want to die.\n\nWas it a scam charity? Probably, since they didn't use GoFundMe. Was the ad emotionally manipulative? Yes. But it didn't matter to me because, scam charity or not, there are children out there in the world suffering like that, needlessly. Suffering with birth defects or terrible diseases not because some human did something bad to them, but just because of their body failing them.\n\nIf I had ultimate power, I would have healed that girl instantly. I would have seen everyone suffering from such illnesses and instantly cured them. I would rewrite the laws of the universe so that such illnesses were impossible to happen anymore than it's a physical impossibility to have a human spontaneously sprout wings or gills.\n\nBut I can't do that because I'm not all-powerful. According to claims, God is. And yet he does absolutely nothing, despite apparently having the power to do so. Even if that is a scam charity or something, that doesn't change the fact that there are many children suffering that way. Suffering that God could prevent but doesn't. He could supposedly easily create a universe where it's impossible for such things to come up. And yet they exist.\n\nThe way I see it, there are only 4 possibilities:\n\n1. **God is incompetent/not omnipotent.** God wants to help, but in fact, does not have power to help anyone. His feats seemed impressive in the Bible, but there were plenty of times where he wasn't all-powerful (not knowing where Adam and Eve were, unable to stop an army because they had iron chariots, the sacrifice of another god being more powerful, etc.). The reason for this is because historically-speaking, the early concepts of God were more akin to the Greek gods, with God having a human form, not being all-powerful, and being one of several gods (which is lost on most English translations because they translate any mentions of other gods as \"The LORD\" to make it seem like there's only one God when there wasn't).\n2. **God is apathetic.** God sees us all more like a disillusioned scientist might see an ant farm, or bacteria. Observing what happens out of scientific curiosity, nothing more. Detatched, having little to no concern for individuals, and shrugging off any death or suffering because there's plenty more where that came from. Everything is just a statistic.\n3. **God is evil.** God is an actively malevolent force and revels in senseless suffering. Any good in the world is just to give us a little taste of something good before snatching it away from us. Given his actions in the Bible, particularly in the Old Testament, where he repeatedly demanded even children be slaughtered, this I feel would be the most Biblically accurate interpretation. He only seemed to mellow out by the New Testament because the followers realized having the war god Yahweh as their god wasn't exactly painting the best picture. They thus changed Satan's Old Testament role as a prosecuting attorney and made him a scapegoat to deflect any evil from God. Not to mention if any concept of Hell is an accurate reflection of reality, that further shows that God is evil. Also there's the matter of parasites and other creatures whose entire life cycle hinges on causing untold suffering to other beings. A god that would create such things is \"I'm curious so I want to see what would happen\" at best and evil at worst.\n4. **God is nonexistent.** Things just happen due to cause and effect, not a purpose. Suffering is not caused by any being, no \"Fall\" (which punishing people who didn't know any better is a point more in the \"God is evil\" camp), but just things that happen by bad luck of the draw. This, I feel, is the option most reflective of reality, and I'd even almost prefer it to a malevolent god that people worship because they've been gaslit into thinking he's good.\n\nIt's like the riddle of Epicurus says:\n\n*Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent.*\n\n*Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent.*\n\n*Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil?*\n\n*Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?*",

Forget would mean to, at least temporarily, lose knowledge. Something forgetting thus couldn't be omniscient. If God doesn't know, even for a fleeting moment he's omniscient, then for that fleeting moment at least, he's not omniscient.\n\n>In the primordial existence before material creation, good and evil existed in the proper balance and existence was at peace.\n\nHow do concepts of good and evil, which by all appearances seem to be relative and applicable only to sentients, exist in primordial chaos?",

                                    "Reply_Text": "> Well, to start, I think our concepts of possibility don’t really apply to the non-material, if they even apply to the physical world which, really, they may not.\n\nSure they can, unless you can present a reason why not. A contradiction is unavoidably untrue, and a forgetful omniscient being is such a contradiction. I'm not sure what philosophical rabbit holes you're diving into, but that much is unavoidable.\n\n>Either way, I would say that the Divine is not bound by contradiction and paradox. God can, in the old example, both be able to create a rock too heavy to lift and also lift it.\n\nSimultaneously, no, and most credible opinions on the matter don't ascribe him such power. See Aquinas for example. God could create an object too heavy to lift, and subsequently increase his strength to lift it.\n\nAs for a forgetful omniscient being, in no way can you explain how such directly opposing facts can simultaneously exist, and to say something to the effect of \"we can't understand it, but know it does\" is itself illogical, because you can't possibly know that about something you understand nothing about. It's an escape hatch argument meant to avoid admitting it's wrong to think this contradiction could be real.\n\n>To our minds, yeah, that’s contradictory, but the Divine can have simultaneously true contradictions. Of course, if you don’t agree with this, then obviously that’s an irreconcilable point here.\n\nIt's perfectly reconcilable. You just need to rethink your position on it.\n\n>As for the good and evil part, I don’t really think the primordial was chaos but, maybe more importantly, in a sort of Kabbalistic sense, I only use good and evil as sort of metaphorical terms to express forces. By “good,” I don’t mean helping a stranger down on their luck; I mean an indescribable force that we can recognize but not define. The same is the case with evil.\n\nSo you're saying there were two opposing \"forces\" which you pretty much cannot describe, know nothing about, and have no obvious meaning?\n\n>Be, really, I don’t think perfection exists materially or in the Divine. I think the nature of existence is imperfection, and, thus, in a manner of speaking, imperfection is perfection\n\nImperfection is perfection, night is day, everything is everything. This doesn't actually mean anything.\n\n>I think we get too caught up in the idea that the Divine would be perfect, and I’d challenge us to ask what perfection even is. I think we long too strongly for something without complexity and flaws\n\nBy definition, that is perfection.\n\n>We even reject ourselves for failing to be “perfect.”\n\n>and perfection as we’ve known it is just an idea we came up with long ago and got ourselves thoroughly obsessed with\n\nIt is a concept, either concrete or abstract. How this is germane to anything I said is beyond me at this point and can't help but wonder how you wandered so far off the reservation.\n\nI, as do many, don't do so, as coming to terms with the fact perfection is unattainable isn't that difficult. Possibly not even desirable.\n\n>So, in that, an imperfect creation by an imperfect creator has no issue with the perfection argument.\n\nThe perfection argument that the creator is perfect? An imperfect creator clearly has a problem where that argument is concerned, if that's the argument you're making but I can't really tell because you're all over the place and, no offense, but a lot of what you're saying seems like gobbledygook.\n\n>That said, I’m not a Christian (or member of any organized faith) and do believe that the Bible is truly awful in what it describes, and I feel the same way about the arguments that suffering is a “test.”\n\nYou do seem like a solipsist, one so willing to do away with meaning as to all but say it never really exists, which is an indefensible position. I'm not a Christian either, or theist of any kind, but as far as what we're talking about is concerned, that doesn't matter. You don't need to mention that if you're concerned about being viewed as biased.",
