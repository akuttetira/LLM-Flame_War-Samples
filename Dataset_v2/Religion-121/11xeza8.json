    "post_text ": "Each religion would just complicate the “true meaning” he was attempting to have us understand (if there is such a thing), and would make it so the whole concept of religion and belief is just this whole concept of guessing and “hoping you’re right” - which is the case for most people today.   \n\nRegions of the world with zero outside contact somehow developed their own complex, independent religion that delved away from the main religions during that time. If Jesus or Allah or whichever god was the almighty, all-powerful god, why would they let all of these other religions and beliefs exist? What’s the point of faith when there are so many other views and beliefs to the point where it’s impossible to know what is right?",

Mary was 12, Cleopatra married a 10 year old. The age of consent in Italy is 14. You can’t make a blanket statement like that.\n\nWhether or not you believe, the fact remains the Quran is revelation from your Creator",
