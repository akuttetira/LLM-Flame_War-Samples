    "post_text ": "Why is it a sin to be prideful when god is the most prideful being imaginable?\n\nWants everyone to submit to him and be lower than him, created a universe of beings lower than him just to entertain his pride.\n\nThose who do not submit suffer eternal punishment. \n\nHe wants servants, also it seems as if he wants to punish those who do not serve him, since if he didn't want that he simply wouldn't create sin.\n\nI never asked to be created I never consented to this. It is either bow your head or perish, and he made me this way as everything is supposedly by his will.\n\nHell, even satan, who was created by god was created with the flaw of pride, a sense of self. Since god doesn't make mistakes that can only mean it was on purpose. Meaning that he created satan in a way that will betray him. What is the purpose of this if not to entertain his pride/superiority.\n\nIn my opinon non-existance is much more merciful than existance.",
