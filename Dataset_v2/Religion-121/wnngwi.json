    "Post_Title": "Mohammad was a obvious fraud and cult leader who used his Religion and Prophethood to fulfill his desires",
    "post_text ": "Mohammad has such a huge role in Islam, that he is as close to Allah as it can get. He is like a demi-god and Islam is mostly all about him. Entire verses are just about pleasing him.\n\nIn fact the Quran says Allah himself prays to Mohammad\n\nQuran 33:56\n\n''Lo! Allah and His angels pray upon the prophet. Oh yea who believe, pray on him and salute him with peace.”\n\nAllah doesn't pray to any other Prophets who came before him, only to him, showcasing how Islam is centered around a 7th century Bedouin who knew nothing about the world outside of Arabia. Is this a religion meant for all mankind?\n\nNow see how Mohammad took advantage of Islam for his own personal gains. Here are just a FEW examples, the rabbit hole goes so deep, i could create dozens of threads about it.\n\nWhen people bothered him at his house, he revealed a verse in which allah tells them to go away and leave him alone\n\nSurah Al-’Ahzab – Verse 53Surah Al-’Ahzab – Verse 53\n\n“O you who believe! Do not enter the houses of the Prophet for a meat without waiting for the proper time, unless permission be granted you. But when you are invited, enter, and, when your meal is ended, then disperse; neither lingering for conversation; verily this annoys the Prophet, and he is ashamed before you, but Allah is not ashamed before the truth. And when you ask his wives for any object, ask them from behind a curtain. This is purer for your hearts and for their hearts. And it is not for you to hurt Allah’s Messenger, neither to marry his wives after him, ever, verily this is grievous (sin) with Allah.”\n\nHow does this Verse benefit all mankind? Why is it in the eternal written words of Allah? Obviously Mohammad didn't care and made up verses as he went along.\n\nMohammad revealed verses which gave him the permission to marry more than 4 wives\n\nSurat Al-'Aĥzāb 33:50\n\n''O Prophet, indeed We have made lawful to you your wives to whom you have given their due compensation and those your right hand possesses from what Allah has returned to you \\[of captives\\] and the daughters of your paternal uncles and the daughters of your paternal aunts and the daughters of your maternal uncles and the daughters of your maternal aunts who emigrated with you and a believing woman if she gives herself to the Prophet \\[and\\] if the Prophet wishes to marry her, \\[this is\\] only for you, excluding the \\[other\\] believers. We certainly know what We have made obligatory upon them concerning their wives and those their right hands possess, \\[but this is for you\\] in order that there will be upon you no discomfort. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful.''\n\nAgain, why does Allah send a holy message to us Humans which is just about Mohammads lust for more women?\n\nMohammad revealed a Verse which allowed him to marry Zaynab bint Jahsh, the wife of his adopted son Zayd ibn Harithah because he saw her undressed and felt sexually attracted to her, basically justifying adultery\n\nSurat Al-'Aĥzāb 33:77\n\n''And \\[remember, O Muhammad\\], when you said to the one on whom Allah bestowed favor and you bestowed favor, \"Keep your wife and fear Allah ,\" while you concealed within yourself that which Allah is to disclose. And you feared the people, while Allah has more right that you fear Him. So when Zayd had no longer any need for her, We married her to you in order that there not be upon the believers any discomfort concerning the wives of their adopted sons when they no longer have need of them. And ever is the command of Allah accomplished.''\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMohammad was sexually attracted to Aisha, a 6 years old girl and claimed he saw her in his dreams and therefore God told him to marry her\n\nbukhari:7012\n\nNarrated \\`Aisha:\n\nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to me, \"You were shown to me twice (in my dream) before I married you. I saw an angel carrying you in a silken piece of cloth, and I said to him, 'Uncover (her),' and behold, it was you. I said (to myself), 'If this is from Allah, then it must happen.' Then you were shown to me, the angel carrying you in a silken piece of cloth, and I said (to him), 'Uncover (her), and behold, it was you. I said (to myself), 'If this is from Allah, then it must happen.' \"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMohammad revealed a Verse which allowed him to keep 1/5th of the spoils of war captured from raided cities during his aggressive military campaigns against Non-Muslims\n\nQuran 8:41, Surat Al-'Anfāl\n\n''And know that anything you obtain of war booty - then indeed, for Allah is one fifth of it and for the Messenger and for \\[his\\] near relatives and the orphans, the needy, and the \\[stranded\\] traveler, if you have believed in Allah and in that which We sent down to Our Servant on the day of criterion - the day when the two armies met. And Allah , over all things, is competent.''\n\nEven if we ignore the fact that Mohammad was a Bandit who pillaged cities, this Verse is also useless. It doesn't even instruct Muslims how to split the spoils of war among themselves since it is just about Mohammad's share, who is not alive anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMohammad also ordered Muslims to murder his critiques, this is why Muslims to this day kill people who criticize him, like the recent assault on Rushdie\n\n(There so SO many examples and sources of that, i'm just gonna post the link where you can look it up yourself: [https://wikiislam.net/wiki/List\\_of\\_Killings\\_Ordered\\_or\\_Supported\\_by\\_Muhammad#cite\\_note-Muhammad\\_pp.\\_675-676-6](https://wikiislam.net/wiki/List_of_Killings_Ordered_or_Supported_by_Muhammad#cite_note-Muhammad_pp._675-676-6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs you can see, Mohammad used Islam to benefit himself. He only wanted Power, Sex and Wealth and revealed Verses and did things, which are completely useless for the rest of mankind. If the Quran is really the words of God and meant to guide all mankind for all eternity, then it wouldn't be about pleasing Mohammad's earthly wishes all the time.",

            "Reply_Text": "Bismillah\n\n>In fact the Quran says Allah himself prays to Mohammad\n\n>Quran 33:56\n\nSalli alaa has a different meaning to Salli ila. Different preposition, different meaning. Allah doesn't pray TO the Prophet, sallAllahu alayhi wa sallam. Also, in our 5 daily prayers, we follow the Prophet tradition of invoking Allah to 'Salli ala Muhammad' as He did to Ibrahim. So your claim that in our tradition this is unique to the Prophet, sallAllahu alayhi wa sallam, is rejected.\n\n>Surah Al-’Ahzab – Verse 53\n\nRead the ayah again. Does it not say that the Prophet, sallAllahu alayhi wa sallam, is too shy to ask people to leave? Considering that we are obligated to follow the Prophet's commands, sallAllahu alayhi wa sallam, why would he 'invent' a verse instructing people to leave? Seems like a bit of excess effort.\n\n>Surat Al-'Aĥzāb 33:50\n\nIf His, sallAllahu alayhi wa sallam, marriages were about lust, then why did he limit his marriages? Why not unlimited marriages? Why were they all, with the exception of Aisha, radhiAllahu anha, with widows and divorcées?\n\n>Surat Al-'Aĥzāb 33:77\n\nI fail to see how anyone would consider marrying your adopted son's ex-wife as incest. Furthermore, this ruling applys to all Muslims.\n\n>Mohammad was sexually attracted to Aisha, a 6 years old girl and claimed he saw her in his dreams and therefore God told him to marry her\n\nIf this was a manifestation of His, sallAllahu alayhi wa sallam, 'lust',  why did He, sallAllahu alayhi wa sallam, wait three years to consummate the marriage? Again, considering our unquestioning obedience to him, sallAllahu alayhi wa sallam, no one would have argued had the marriage been consummated with a 6 year old.\n\n>Quran 8:41, Surat Al-'Anfāl\n\nThe Prophet, sallAllahu alayhi wa sallam, chose to lie and die in poverty. If these wars were about self-enrichment, where are all the reports of his, sallAllahu alayhi wa sallam, lavish wealth?\n\n>He only wanted Power, Sex and Wealth\n\nExcept for the first 13 years of Prophecy the Muslim community were persecuted, tortured, then boycotted and eventually forced to leave their city. That's one hell of a gamble for someone only interested in power,  sex and wealth, especially considering he was offered all three to give up the message.\n\nEven when he, sallAllahu alayhi wa sallam, had political power, this wasn't used for self-Enrichment, as he lived and died poor. As for sex, if I was only in it for the women, I wouldn't bother with marriages and just go to town.\n\nMaybe learn a little about our religion before you try to regurgitate some anti-Islam websites.\n\nPeace.",

Seems like a bit of excess effort.\n\nGood thing you notice that 😂 you just need to used this brain of yours a little more to know why.\n\n>If His, sallAllahu alayhi wa sallam, marriages were about lust, then why did he limit his marriages?\n\nhe what? LIMIT his marriages 😂😂😂? oh so generous of him to say I'm not having sex anymore with more than my 11 wives and sex slaves. Clearly you haven't seen all the hadiths about how some of his wives were mad at him for being basically a pig.\n\n>I fail to see how anyone would consider marrying your adopted son's ex-wife as incest\n\nIf you fail to see how **making your adopted son leave his wife, which is also your fucking cousin, so you can fuck her, and abolish the adoption system in the process**, as a horrible thing to do, then you're a miserable human being.\n\n>wait three years to consummate the marriage?\n\noooh so generous of him to wait 3 years before fucking literally a very young child.\n\nFucking pedophile\n\n>chose to lie and die in poverty\n\nExcept he achieved what people at his time could only dream of. A kingdom of women who gave themselves to him and men who would die for him. He could have whatever he wanted. If he was hungry he could eat at whichever home he wanted. Just compare him to the actual poor people at his time to see if he really died in poverty.\n\n>Except for the first 13 years of Prophecy the Muslim community were persecuted, tortured, then boycotted and eventually forced to leave their city.\n\nAside from the torture thing (which was done by slavemasters, not justifying it but people were stupid back then, including your prophet), this is what muslims get when shitting on every other community in their country and only want themselves to thrive and rule (you people still do it today btw). Not saying that it should be done today, but you do that in a 7th century city with your clear intentions to change the entire system to a not-so-better one (as the pedophile did when he gained power), then you get what you deserve.\n\nIf people of Mecca were not that peaceful, how did they had to wait 13 fucking years before taking such actions? Does that not indicate that whoever did the torturing were not the majority and where not supported? Would your pedophile last 13 years straight if that was the case?\n\n>Maybe learn a little about our religion\n\nI learned a LOT, and that's why I left it.\n\nPeace",
