    "Post_Title": "The fact that scientists are much less religious than non-scientists is very damaging to the idea that God's design is evident in the universe.",
    "post_text ": "When we compare scientists to non-scientists, almost invariably the [scientists are less religious](https://phys.org/news/2015-12-worldwide-survey-religion-science-scientists.html). Obviously, not all scientists are irreligious, and the article makes a big point about that. Still, the difference between the two groups is pretty glaring.\n\nWhy is this an issue? Well, if someone wants to make an *argument from design* and back it up with evidence, there aren't a lot of avenues for assessing this claim. I'm suggesting that a *scientists versus non-scientists* comparison is the closest we can get to \"evidence\" one way or another. With that being said, if the pro-design people are right then we should expect that *the people who understand the universe the most should be the most religious*. Instead, we have the *exact opposite* result. If the results broke even or were statistically insignificant then we could leave it at that, but the fact that it is the *complete inverse* of this expectation is, frankly, quite damaging to the whole notion.\n\nNote that what I'm illuminating doesn't really qualify as an \"argument\", and it doesn't prove anything. It is mainly an observation that the pro-design crowd needs to explain.\n\nEDIT: I'm saying that scientists are the most knowledgeable about *natural, observable* phenomena. Obviously.",

I just think that is absurd though. Many, many scientists have observed intelligent design. Also our eco system is so codependent and fragile that it basically all had to appear at once. Also if macro evolution was real there would be billions upon billions of transitional species and fossils… but there’s not 🤷🏽‍♂️",

Changing conditions create exploitable niches that life evolves into, which creates other exploitable niches for other life to evolve into.\n\n> Micro evolution is definitely real but If macro evolution was real then there’d be tons of transitional species and billions of transitional fossils but there isn’t. Like at all.\n\nIt is literally not possible for you to be more wrong. Every single fossil that exists is a transitional fossil, and every living thing is a transitional species. Not understanding this fact speaks to a fundemental misunderstanding of what evolution is. It's an equivalently dire misunderstanding as someone claiming that statistics is BS because the chance of something happening is always 50% \"because it either happens or it doesn't\", like, just an absolutely basic confusion about the facts.\n\n> I mean just observe the human body or an animal for a few seconds or even a tree\n\n\"It obvious!\" is not an argument, neither are your intuitions, neither are your feelings. Natural selection is a plausible explanation for the *appearance* of conscious design in the natural world, so you cannot appeal to that appearance as a refutation of it. You need to do better than this.",

Those dependencies can have developed through time. How do you actually rule that out?\n\n>1. Micro evolution is definitely real but If macro evolution was real then there’d be tons of transitional species and billions of transitional fossils but there isn’t. Like at all.\n\nWhat do you mean by transitional species?\n\nDo you realise that your first two points here are not arguing for design at all? Even if evolution was not an accurate model for how different species developed, that wouldn't mean design is the answer. That's a \"design of the gaps\" .\n\n>2. I mean just observe the human body or an animal for a few seconds or even a tree, flower, etc and imho at least it seems pretty obvious that everything is intelligently designed. Many other scientists have come to the same conclusion.\n\n\"It's pretty obvious\" is not an argument, it's just expressing a feeling.\nIt's not obvious to me at all that the human body designed.",

First, do you understand that the notion of \"transitional\" or \"intermediate\" species doesn't make sense because every species can be said to be transitional or intermediate.\n\nSo, if we have successions of fossils with slight modifications over time, that would be evidence for evolution, right?

That is not in dispute. Whether the Big Bang had a cause or not is also not in dispute, it didn't, because the Big Bang was the beginning of time, and you can't have cause and effect without time. Why the universe started up is unknown and may be impossible to figure out, but who knows.",
