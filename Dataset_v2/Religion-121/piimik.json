    "post_text ": "The book was written over 2000 years ago and by like 50 different people. \n\nI know the “telephone” argument isn’t all to accurate but what about the fact that it was written by a ton of different people? How can you be so sure these guys were telling the truth? \n\nHow do you know they weren’t just making it all up for their own gain? Who’s to say they weren’t corrupt by the devil? Who’s to say they were as pure and close to god as they say the were? \n\nMy point being, there is no way you can validate the credibility of the authors of the bible, there’s just no way. And with that in mind, the credibility of the bible also falls short. \n\nAnd this doesn’t just apply to Christianity I’m just focusing on it as I myself am an ex-Christian and this is one of the reasons why. \n\nBut I guess it just all comes down to faith in the end...",

You need someone (priest) to explain it to you!\"\n-\"that's out of context\"\n-\"that's a metaphor, not literal\"\n-\"this contradiction is not important\"\n-\"well that's just a scribal error\"\n-\"no archaeological evidence of the exodus exists because God destroyed all the evidence\".\n-\"where in the Bible does it say the earth is flat? Oh that's just bs\"\n\nThe list of copes by the Bible believers are endless. These people have been indoctrinated since they were kids, if they don't seek out the truth by themselves, and believe the religion they have been born into just happens to be the right one out of sheer luck... Then they will never find the truth.",

It is one thing to debate a subject with an open mind and another to close your mind and attack people. I see it with Theists all the time, and as Atheists we should hold ourselves to the same standards.
