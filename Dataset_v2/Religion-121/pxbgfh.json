    "post_text ": "I mean other than having 50+ different types of bibles, why is the King James edition the most heavily circulated bible in the world? Because it’s man made, and King James adjusted it to push his political agenda. People have been altering the original bible for so long, that Christians are now blind followers to whatever man made book they’re presented. \n\nThey don’t have any sense of standard, which would be the original bible. Ask a Christian who they believe in as God. Some might tell you just God himself, some might tell you Jesus, some might tell you God and Jesus, some might tell you Jesus is the direct son of God, some might tell you Jesus is God, and some might tell you they believe in a variation of the holy trinity. Obviously there’s no consistency in Christianity. If Christianity was true, there wouldn’t be so much ambiguity in something as simple as “Who is God?“ That’s literally the most basic question of religion. All these variations came about because it is a man made religion and man is not perfect.\n\nTo continue, why do some Christians (usually the more devout) abstain from alcohol and pork, while some Christians indulge in it in religious ceremonies? Jesus never ate pork or drank alcohol, so as a follower of the teachings of Jesus Christ, why do so many Christians say it’s permissible? Even in some versions of the Bible (usually the older ones), it directly says to abstain from pork and alcohol. It sounds like man altered the bible to make it permissible to sin, and spread it as gospel.\n\nWhy do Christians say “Jesus died for our sins”? Where did this come from, because it’s not written in the Bible. What’s the point in religion then if “Jesus died for our sins?” Is nobody held accountable for there deeds then? Did Jesus die for Hitler’s sins? Should Hitler go to heaven despite killing 6 million people because Jesus died for his sins? Again, another man made piece of rhetoric used by Christians as an excuse to sin.\n\nAs I got older, I realized how many contradictions and alterations are in Christianity. I noticed that the Christian community brushes off major contradictions and errors so nonchalantly, like it’s nothing, but we should always ask questions. If something is really true, shouldn’t it be able to stand the test of questioning? I finally came to learn that Christianity is a bunch of baloney. It’s contradiction after contradiction. Sure, there’s some parts of it that probably are unaltered words from God and his messenger, but major parts of it are definitely man made.",

People have been altering the original bible for so long, that Christians are now blind followers to whatever man made book they’re presented.**\n\nlol... no. well it is clear 'christian's' are not the only one who doesn't understand what they believe.\n\nAs bibles even the kjv and it's derivatives are not translated that way. You do not seem to know we have the compilation of hand written manuscripts from which the kjv was translated. ( Textus Receptus ) these compilations are called codices.\n\nAs stated they are a completion of the original manuscripts in the koine Greek that the bibles are translated from. There are several codacees from which the majority of the holy bibles are translated from. at the time of the KJV Textus Receptus (the majority text) was what was available.\n\nsince then two other older and more complete codices were found which did in fact change the translation a little between bibles translated from the Textus Receptus. The commandment \"thou shalt not kill\" for instance was derived from the Textus Receptus. this order is a prohibition on the taking of all human life. where as text from the Sinaiticus or the Vaticanus commands you shall not murder. which is the unauthorized taking of human life. that is one of the biggest changes in the text.\n\nSo politics played very little into the translation as again there are several bibles translated from the Textus Receptus and aside from being translated to a active dialect very little separates the kjv and a modern bible from the same codex.\n\n**They don’t have any sense of standard, which would be the original bible.**\n\nagain... maybe google how bibles are made. there is a standard. but as any people who speak more than one language will tell you there are two primary forms of translation one is literal which gives you word for word which alot of time does not correct for grammar or syntax. meaning alot of the time if you were to hear a literal translation it would not make sense or the word placement in a sentence would be out of order. (like talking with yoda) then you have a subjective or contextual translation based on communicating the idea of the message rather than a nonsensical word for word.\n\nBut the problem with a contextual translation it heavily depends on the translators understanding of the subject matter. or any social filters they may put the text through.\n\nThe holy bible is about 75% literal and 25% contextual as it try and puts the wording in a common use understanding but at the same time tries to preserve as much of the orginal text as possible. which is why it is o important to be able to read/use a lexicon along side the bible so you can look up the greek words and see alternate meanings/usages.\n\nNow that said there are many denominationally specific bibles as well. these can be a 50/50% mix or they can be 80% personal interpretation/interpretation filter through a church doctrine with 20% original material.\n\nHoly bible tend to be higher original content bibles.\n\n**Ask a Christian who they believe in as God. Some might tell you just God himself, some might tell you Jesus,** No again. if you only believe in god that makes you a theist. it takes belief in christ and God the Father at a minimum to be any sort of \"christian\" as this terms denotes or identifies as a follower of christ.\n\n**some might tell you God and Jesus, some might tell you Jesus is the direct son of God, some might tell you Jesus is God, and some might tell you they believe in a variation of the holy trinity.**\n\nOnce we get to the understanding Jesus was the son of God and died on the cross for our sin. we are christian. as a christian other religious details do not matter. Why? because the same atonement offered when we willfully sin is also offered when we are worship god with all of our heart, mind, spirit and strength and just get it wrong. Jesus explain this via the parable of the talents. In that we are only responsible for what was given to us/what we can understand.",

(paul says this is wrong to do this /Who are you to judge your master's servant.) noR am i claiming it is by my judgement that people will or will not be saved as you seem to be doing.\n\nWhat i am saying is if you believe Jesus died on the cross for your sins, then you have the frame work in your life to be also forgiven when you are trying to love God with all of your heart mind spirit and strength while loving your neighbor as yourself to be forgiven with the same mechanism of grace when we willfully sin. because it is not a sin for having a finite understanding/mental capacity  of God and how he is to have structured the church.\n\nThink about it. if you had a 4 year old and she drew a stick figure pic of your family house dog as an expression of love and appreciation for you and her life.. would you then punish her for the picture not being digitally/4k accurate? would you burn her to literal death for not being smart enough or skilled enough to accurately reproduce an exact image of all you have provided?\n\nOr..\n\nif she is indeed your child does the same grace and mercy kick in when she willfully disobeys you, also apply when she is trying to love you with all of her heart, mind, spirit and strength, while loving her brother as herself?\n\nbottom line is if you don't want all of your religious quirks/blasphemes scrutinized to a 4k/digital image level by your father, then perhaps we/you should not judge your neighbor, as paul says allow God to judge his own servants...\n\nthink parable of the talents. God does not give everyone the same amount of (in this case understanding/smarts) concerning himself and the church. but rather we are charged to only be responsible for what we have been given. If god gives you a mormon understanding of himself how is he to hold you responsible to then be a quaker?\n\nPaul perfectly points this out in the one body many parts lesson. As each member of the body has a different function and one member of the church should not look at another member/denomination and say they are not apart of the body of christ just because they do not work/worship in the body the same way they do!\n\nAll you can say is that form (as a foot) of worship is not conducive or will not work/worship for people who serve the body as an eye or ear.\n\nYou can even point out how ears can't worship/function as a foot. but you can't say they are not apart of the body because they are not ears. Let alone judge who is and who is not saved.\n\nIf They are in a jesus Christ as the son of God relationship with God, know that the same principle that forgives willful sin also protects us from punishment for our want to love god with all of our ability, but just get it wrong.\n\nYou better hope so anyway as none of us has it 100% correct.",

All these variations came about because it is a man made religion and man is not perfect.**\nAh, no again... The reason we have so many different sects is because Christ only gave two rules when setting up the church which allows us to be justified before God by doing the best we can. For some the best we can do\" will be a lot more than others. if God gave you the gift of singing, your best will never be utilized if you are sitting in a church praying all day. no you need to be in a church with like minded believers singing! like wise if you make good prayers your time will be wasted singing, and you need to be in a church praying.. and on and on it goes. which is why we have 30K different version of christianity. Now add in people's ability to understand and know the heart and mind of God based on what God has given them over to comprehend... and the number of churches needed so everyone can do their best and follow the two laws are potentially endless. because we are all a little different our best will be different, yet we all need a place where we can understand believe and worship to our best.\n\n\nbesides that look at the bible and how God set up the jews with the perfect religion. 600+ laws designed to bring God's people closer to him, and in about 2000 years the law was so corrupted so twisted it allowed the most holy people to exert the least amount of effort while put a tremendous burden on everyday followers. many could not even meet the min requirements even doing their best while the leadership got fat and lazy (spiritually speaking) Just look at how Jesus spoke with the most holy men on the planet at the time. in mat 23 Jesus takes a whole chapter to cuss these boys out. Jesus criticized them and judged them so much they had him killed.\n\n\nShowing us that even if God hand writes out the law we would corrupt it to make it a tool to keep people from god. the christian church is even guilty of this durning the dark ages. but God's church was restored and the truth of Jesus 2 rules to enter heaven, and a church based on doing your best is now back.\n\n\nThat said any christians with access to a bible can tell you exactly who god is.\n\n\n**To continue, why do some Christians (usually the more devout) abstain from alcohol and pork, while some Christians indulge in it in religious ceremonies?**\n\n\nBecause they only understand that restrictions and works are the only way to worship God and make him happy. So then in their minds it is a sin not to do those things. So God holds them to what they understand because again for them their best... (which is the only thing required) says they must follow the law.\n\n\nOther christian have read a little more of their bibles or understand a little more of their bible and know these things are no longer required.\n\n\n**Jesus never ate pork or drank alcohol, so as a follower of the teachings of Jesus Christ, why do so many Christians say it’s permissible?**\n\n\nBecause unlike christ who was born as an old testament jew and under the law of OT judaism, we gentiles were born outside of this covenant and this law does not apply to us. rather we elect to follow Christ who 'completed the law' which when asked what i must do to enter heaven He responded with\" 1) Love your Lord God with all of your heart, with all of your mind, spirit and strength, 2) the second command is like it. you must love your neighbor as yourself. and in following these two laws you will have completely satisfied the laws of the prophets. Meaning everything the OT jews had to do to enter heaven, are covered by these two laws. (which include pork wine meat ect)\n\n\nThat said if a brother in christ does not understand this, the we who know the truth can not tempt the weaker brother even if we know it is not a sin to us or god, it is a sin for him and if he sins in his mind we are guilty of causing him to stumble.\n\n\n**Even in some versions of the Bible (usually the older ones), it directly says to abstain from pork and alcohol. It sounds like man altered the bible to make it permissible to sin, and spread it as gospel.**\nActually it doesn't, in any holy bible. there are some bible made for specific denomination that say this but these commands are not apart of the original text/codices.\n\n\n**Why do Christians say “Jesus died for our sins”? Where did this come from, because it’s not written in the Bible.**\nhere are a few quotes that say jesus died for our sins:\n1 Corinthians 15:3 ESV\n\nFor I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,\nJohn 1:29 ESV\n\nThe next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!\nActs 2:38 ESV\n\nAnd Peter said to them, “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.\nhere are a few dozen other examples:\n[https://www.openbible.info/topics/jesus\\_died\\_for\\_our\\_sins](https://www.openbible.info/topics/jesus_died_for_our_sins)\n\n\n**What’s the point in religion then if “Jesus died for our sins?”**\nTo worship and loveGod with all of your ability with out restriction rule law or resistence. to be able to be seen as righteous before God just as you are with out the need for law or other men telling you who or what God is.. Meaning you have direct access to God and God has direct access to you. here in this life and in the next.\n\n\n**Is nobody held accountable for there deeds then?** actually everyone is held to account, unless they can love God and their brothers as required by Christ.\nwhether you understand the new covenant or not it basically says God no longer judges you by what you do but rather why you do it. if you do anything whether it be judge good or evil by your peers, God looks at why you are doing it to judge you good or evil. The bible says if you do good deeds to be renown by men that is all the reward you will get.. while men you would consider to be selfish or evil like prostitutes and tax collectors can find redemption.\n\n\n**Did Jesus die for Hitler’s sins? Should Hitler go to heaven despite killing 6 million people because Jesus died for his sins? Again, another man made piece of rhetoric used by Christians as an excuse to sin.**\nthis question is based on a form of 'morality' when in fact all morality is sin. as morality is a sliding scale or degrees of sin. like telling a white lie to keep someone from killing themselves is 'moral act' but God's command was not to lie which make the lie a sin. This would indicate God treat sin more like we would a virus. rather than a matter of good or bad deeds needing reward or punishment's. now the only question is are you vaccinated. if you are vaccinated you can enter the quarantine zone/heaven. If hitler was vaccinated (he did not believe in God per his book despite what people say) it would be up to Christ to make that call as he is our final judge and will not be fooled or forced to make a judgement based on someone trying to exploit a loop hole (heb 4 spells this out)\n\n\n**As somebody that used to be Christian, as I got older, I realized how many contradictions and alterations are in Christianity.** Really? as most of these questions are generally ask by muslims. I've studied with my share and it's like these questions come out of a book meant to fortify muslim belief/to challenge young christians with. either way\n\nthe only people who say this typically cant differentiate between the religion/denomination issues, and what the bible says. the bible is clear our denominational teaching are where the problems are.\n\n\n**I noticed that the Christian community brushes off major contradictions and errors so nonchalantly, like it’s nothing, but we should always ask questions.** then bring these 'contradiction here.' \"1 thess 5:21 Question all things and hold on to what is good.\" I've asked alot of questions over the years and have been given alot of answers and happy to share.\n\n\n**It’s contradiction after contradiction.**\nplease.. share",

Paul sets up the church in the bible IE it is a biblical religion.\n\n**Christianity is denominational, and it's not a \"biblical\" religion period.**\n\nDid paul set up one church with one set of rules? no he set up churches if different regions like Rome, Corinth, Ephesus, Galatia, Philippi, and Thessalonica. Each one of these churches faces different problem because they were of different regions/different cultures, so paul tailored made rules unique to each church. some churches he tells to abstain from eating meat offered to idols because in them contain people who think this to be a sin while other churches it is not a problem at all because none of the members grew up with the ot law telling them it is wrong.\n\nEach book/letter to the individual churches pushed them in a different direction. which means each book like romans corinthians galatians was a rule set for a different denomination.\n\nhe even speaks to this specifically in his lesson of one body many parts. he reckons each believer or even denomination is a piece of a larger \"body of Christ where Jesus is the head. and we are member of said body and each member functions differently. IE the church is made up of many different denominations. this message is found in 1 cor 12.. that my friend makes it biblical.. plus the books of the bible i listed out showing paul putting into practice giving each church in those various cities their own direction makes denominational worship again biblical.\n\nmaybe look at the definition of biblical again as you do not seem to be using it correctly.\n\n**It has nothing to do with muh Muslim boogeyman, Christianity is a religion of endless contraditions and the most ridicoulus plot-holes.

And Christianity is a perversion of the Jewish religion, and the Torah was given without expiration date.**\n\nAs it is no longer possible to be a Jew as the Ot describes (from 70Ad forward with the destruction of the temple where the dome of the rock now sits) any for of judaism is now compromised scripturally. This form of worship ended about 2000 years ago at which time there were over 600 laws to follow. IE the destruction of the temple and their leadership along with the geologies from which new priests were to be verified and sourced..  was the \"expiration date\" you seem to have missed..\n\nagain if it is no longer possible to follow the laws of god, then that form of worship is no longer viable. Not to say jews can't worship, just not as OT jews per their own laws.\n\n**Restored how? Whivh Church are you talking about? The Catholic? Orthodox?**\n\nthose are denominations who own churches.. *\"The Church* is not owned by a denomination but rather it speak of the elect of christ. meaning we do not get to award ourselves with the title *\"The Church\"* though many denominations try. No, only Jesus can identify a member of *the Church*.\n\nAs *The church* is the Body of Christ which is made up of people from every denomination of christianity, judaism and those who came before the jews. it is the saved. the collective of people who Christ individually judges as being saved..\n\nIt is these people in that time who took back the religious nature of the physical church/religious efforts (religion being the efforts of man to worship God)\n\n**You're joking, right? Or just feigning ignorance? Can you even decide if Jesus is the son of the only God or God #2? Can you define son, or explain how a son can be without beginning?**\n\nSon of God means Jesus' Roll in the trinity is that of a son which is modeled in OT judaism. The term is used to allow stupid people to have an understanding of how this aspect of god works.\n\nThe son of God is the one who enacts the will of the father/decision maker materarch. The son is like the Right hand of the father. Right hand or 'hand of the King' being another term. as he is not a physical hand, but rather an individual/deity responsible to make the father's will happen. as john 1 says Jesus was the creator. When the father said let their be light the son of God turned on the switch.\n\nWhat else you got?",

It's not. Secondly, there wasn't any \"the Bible\" when Paul set up his communities. Thirdly, you can't even gave the concept of a Bible canon without a foundation of authority.

Neither is an \"office\", or contain \"parts\". There is only one personal Most High God and Creator however. You worship three making you a willful idolater and polytheist.**\n\nthis is not true at all.\n\nRemember the word god is not God in the hebrew. the word God is eloha which is a singular masculine noun. it is the hebrew linguistic equivalent of the word god in english. Eloha is the direct translation of the word God. it is a singular masculine noun, denoting 1 deity. This word is used to describe or specifically reference God the Father God as it symbolises a singular deity.\n\n\nthis word was used 52 times to describe the singular deity of God the father,\n\n\nSTRONGS H433:\n\nאֱלֹהַּ 57 so Deuteronomy 32:17; לֶאֱלֹהַּ Daniel 11:38 (see BD) suffix לֵאלֹהוֺ Habakkuk 1:11; elsewhere אֱלוֺהַּ noun masculine god, God. (Samaritan id., Aramaic H426 אֱלָהּ, axhXlAf  , Arabic إِله, Sabean אלה DHMl.c.; — אֱלֹהַּ as found in Hebrew probably a singular formed by inference from plural אֱלֹהִים : compare Nesl.c.) —\n\n1. a heathen god, late usage; כָּל־אֱלוֺהַּ 2 Chronicles 32:15; Daniel 11:37; זוּ כחו לאלהו whose power is his god Habakkuk 1:11; 2 Kings 17:31 (but Qr אֱלֹהֵי), אשר הביא אֱלוֺהַּ בְּיָדוֺ who doth bring God in his hand Job 12:6 (Ew Di RVm, etc.)\n\n2. God, used in ancient poems Deuteronomy 32:15, 17; Psalm 18:32, and on their basis an archaism in later poetry Job 3:4 + (41 times Job), Psalm 50:22; Psalm 114:7; Psalm 139:19; Proverbs 30:5; Isaiah 44:8; Habakkuk 3:3; Nehemiah 9:17 (citing Exodus 34:6 where H410 אֵל is used).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever..\n\n\nThis is not the common form of God we see in the bible. when we read \"in the beginning God created.. the word they use to describe a single deity 'god' is not used but rather a plural form (more than one deity) is used. The direct correct translation in english would be 'Gods'.\n\nThe hebrew word is ĕlôhîym, el-o-heem'\nאֱלֹהִים ʼĕlôhîym, el-o-heem'; plural of H433; gods in the ordinary sense; but specifically used (in the plural thus, especially with the article) of the supreme God; occasionally applied by way of deference to magistrates; and sometimes as a superlative:—angels, × exceeding, God (gods) (-dess, -ly), × (very) great, judges, × mighty.\n\n\n[Blueletterbible.org](https://Blueletterbible.org)\n\nThis definition which includes angels, great and mighty judges speak not of a singular deity but to an office of power.\n\n\nSo when translated we do not translated from the plural hebrew to the english we do not use the direct translation \"Gods\"  even though this is a masculine plural noun. we translate God singular. And yet the context reflects more than one 'God' through out the creation narrative. one point being at the fall when god said:22 Then the Lord God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of us in knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat, and live forever—”22 Then the Lord God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of us in knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat, and live forever—”\n\nthis means the typical understanding of the word God does not apply because in order for the context to denote more than two and the hebrew usage of a plural form of the word does not support the singular translation UNLESS as i pointed out the word God here is being uses as a title and not a name.\n\nNow unless you can show me as i have shown you in the lexicons that i am wrong.. don't bother with a response, as your word means nothing again the reference material i used to support my statement.\n\n(all i'm saying is put more work into your response then nut-huh this is not what i was taught.\n\n**No. First off, bibilical in this context means the Bible (the various canons) is the basis of Christianity (a misconception mostly held by Evangelicals, in all their unparellelled ignorance).**\n\nagain.. I referenced the holy bible sport. out side of this there are only 13 primary canons from that the contested book are primarily ot which have very little to do with the NT church. of Nt books only three are contested, none of which are being used by any of the other thirteen canons/sects. so what are you talking about?\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical\\_canon#Canons\\_of\\_various\\_Christian\\_traditions\n\n**Lmao. That's partialism. There are no parts in your false triad-idol; each member is affirmed as fully and distinctly God. That's one, two, three Gods. You literally don't even know what you worship. You're every but as ridiculous as the false religion you follow. Please, show me any other religionists on the face of this planet that doesn't even know what they worship or their own core doctrines. Only Christians!**\n\nshow me sport.. show me in the greek and hebrew as i showed you, that you were wrong. show me how i am wrong exegetically. otherwise giving my belief a fancy name an quickly move to dismiss my thoughts without explanation is not going to cut it. if you can not explain how this word applies to what i said and canonically why it is wrong, then you are not in a position to use it.\n\n**It's not. Secondly, there wasn't any \"the Bible\" when Paul set up his communities.** this tells me you did not read or understand the point being made. is english your first language?\n\n**Thirdly, you can't even gave the concept of a Bible canon without a foundation of authority. appeal to authority..** kinda can as the foundation and authority to have a biblical discussion is derive from the bible you used to refute my initial statements. IE if you yourself (which you did) use the bible to disprove a position then that same bible becomes fair use/fair play in reestablishing said position. You are not smart enough to play both sides of the fence.. pick one side and stick with it if you are going to make a charge like that.\n\n**Fourthly, Paul was in clear conflict with the Jerusalem apostolic fraction, and later Judaic messianic communities.** This is such a statement as i was just talking about. as this is proof you are using biblical text to make a statement against paul as a religious authority..\n\nAs clearly no other texts out side of religious writtens contain this conflict. which means if you consider the bible authority enough to condemn paul it is again authority enough to make my arguments.\n\nagain again according to all gospel accounts the parable of the talents show God only considers or judges us not to a specific religious standard or rule but rather according to what he has given us which was portioned based on our ability. If paul was given a greater understanding than peter then Paul was obligated to teach it for those who also would eventually have a greater understanding of God than peter.\n\nAs God is infinite and we finite to varying degrees, we will worship differently as we grow till we top out at out limits. but that doesn't mean your limits should be mine. if i can understand and worship better/more then God obligates me to do this with this parable. That is why we have conflict and different denominations. because our required love with all of our heart mind spirit and strength will look different from person to person.",

It has nothing to do with muh Dark Ages, Christianity was conceieved as a Church, from the patristic age and onwards, and that is what it remained until the inventing of the printing press and the following Reformation, and that is what it remained in mainline Protestantism too.

My mother (korean) has similar difficulty fishing out details and nuance if i do not speak plainly and speak without metaphor. I have no trouble doing this for you if you need me too. other wise i would tell you go back and reread what i said as your response does not address the point i was making...again..\n\nDo you people ever stop lying. You claim Judaism could't be observed without a temple. You lie and you are ignorant. Now you claim it's just a metaphor. Lmao. Jews just metaphorically can't observe and uphold their covenant, huh? You people have the absurd and ridicoulus lies.\n\n>because again Jesus identifies \"The Church\" before the RC or greeks The church is not a religion it is what Jesus identifies as the saved.\n\nJesus of Nazareth was a Torah-observant, monotheistic Jew, and has absolutely zero to do with your Greco-Roman pagan religion. There's one mother church of Christianity, and Christianity was founded as a church. It's not even debatable. And there's no salvation in idolatry.\n\n>again i did not say you would like accept or even understand the answers (especially if english is a problem)\n\nYou have no problem communicating in English, just answer the question; is Jesus the son of the only God or God #2? You don't even know what you worship. Explain how a son can be without beginning.\n\n>Jesus is Apart of the trinity which is God the trinity being a modern word describing the \"government\" or governing body of god discussed in my last post to you. so asked and answered in my last post 1st paragraph what else you got? 4 more tries..\n\nYour analogy is false, and you don't even know that the triad-idol is.",

God gave them 600+ rules to worship by, and when asked Jesus condensed them down to 2 with Love being the foundation for everything we do.\n\nThat the same atonement offered when we willfully sin is also there when we worship with all of our hearts minds spirit and strength and simple get it wrong.\n\nthen i tied in the parable of the talents to show not all of us has been given the same amount of in this case knowledge ro understanding of God. that it does not matter the amount we return just that we work with and double what we have been given.\n\nthis means is if all you have is the dark age church rendition of christianity to work with God is not holding you to a higher standard because again of you are working what you have been given for the Glory of God and put all your heart, mind spirit and strength into while loving your neighbor as yourself. Jesus says this is all that is required.\n\nte advent of the bible and the protestant church is the result of men honoring what they have been given to understand and doubling the allotment the lord gave them in the beginning.\n\nif you weren't being dismissive and just looking for key words to scan and quickly classify my effort here you might have learned something without being rebuked.\n\n**I read your comment, and you don't have a clue what you're talking about period, or any \"deeper\" knowledge. And yes, you have all the collective information of mankind and the entire documented history of the church at the tip of your fingers, and still you choose ignorance. Like you choose idolatry.**\n\nperfect example of you scanning my work for key words, and not looking to read or understand what i have to say. you picked out one word and wrapped it in an ad hom attack. you did not highlight or support your personal attack in any way. you did not identify or correct any statements you just went straight into personal attack mode citing a key word that fits your attack.\n\nDo you not see the difference between you and i? when i correct one of your statements, I take what you said down to the core and tell you how every bit of what you said is wrong and where you made your mistake. This is how an educated person speaks to another educated person trying to help the other person see the points being made.\n\nYou on the other hand are just calling me stupid, and try and slap me/my ideas down by saying they are invalid because you don't like me or what i have to say. this is low order apes sort out things out.\n\ni point this out because many people don't even know they do this. but now you do. so can you try and use your words.. to go line by line and point by point and show me, just as i have done with every single post of yours. can you do the same for me? can you show me where i am supposedly wrong?\n\nif you can't you do not belong here, or perhaps i do not belong here. either way.. put some more effort into your rebuttals or find some other 'person' to brow beat.\n\n**Jesus of Nazareth was a Torah-observant, monotheistic Jew, and has absolutely zero to do with your Greco-Roman pagan religion.**\n\nActually he wasn't. He called himself \"I am\" which is the name of the monotheistic torah based god. this is outright blaspheme according to the law and requires a person to be stoned to death.\n\nHe did not observe the sabbath as the Pharisees instructed.\n\nHe did not follow the instruction of moses to stone the woman caught in adultery.\n\nHe altered the torah in mat five from 600+ laws down to two\n\nHe taught a different prayer/way to pray.\n\nHe never once was on record have made or having had a sacrificial animal made on his behalf.\n\nHe ate with and hung around the 'unclean' which was prohibited by the social law. (lepers, prostitutes, the dead, and known sinners like tax collectors.)\n\nhe kicked over the temple priest's/money changers tabled and whipped/with a whip those involved with cheating people with their high exchange rates.\n\nhe cursed out and humiliated the most holy men/high priests in the jewish religion, to the point the had him crucified.\n\nso no he was not the typical hebrew believer. then after his death he instituted changes that made the torah and ot teachings incomplete. He changed everything by making his two law religion supercede ot judaism that you had to be born into.\n\n(again do you see the difference between my rebuttals and yours? I gave you 10 point based in scripture that prove you wrong. things you can't refute. where as i have no doubt i am going to be on the end of more personal insults.)\n\nwhich is why this is it if you can do better.\n\n**There's one mother church of Christianity, and Christianity was founded as a church. It's not even debatable. And there's no salvation in idolatry.**\n\nagain my guy Jesus speaks of **The Church.**.. he spoke of it before any man made organization called itself *'the church.'*\n\nthis means when speaking of **The Church** What Christ speaks of it is not a man made organization. These did not come into being till after the resurrection. He is speaking of those in whom he himself hand picks/The saved.\n\nHowever when we speak of *\"the church\"* he are thinking of man made organizations that are doctrinally separated by our religious efforts which again mean nothing by themselves.\n\n**\"The Church\"** are the body of Christ maybe if it helps you to understand i will use that term so you can have your meaningless name and treat it how traditional blind belief tells you.\n\n**You have no problem communicating in English,**\n\nthis is not true as the last 2/3s of everything i have written is me clarifying neuances in the discussing you are not able to discern on your own. it is clear by my last post alone discussing the difference between **\"the Chrurch\"** and the church you do not get the finner points of the english language. the death nail is your next query. i've directly answered this 5 times now and like a first year english student you ask the question again because you do not understand the answer.\n\n**just answer the question; is Jesus the son of the only God or God #2?
