    "post_text ": "Put aside theories about the existence/non-existence of god, and put aside things like lack of evidence. I would just like to mention something important about atheism. Which is that I think theists automatically assume, as if it's a given, that atheism leads to nihilism, sadness, darkness and depression.\n\nI think this is often implied and assumed, and it isn't tackled by atheists because it's a secondary argument. With the primary arguments for atheism being lack of evidence and errors in logic. However I believe the opposite of this assumption is true. And below are several considerations as to why:\n\n...\n\nReal happiness based on truth v fake happiness based on illusion.\n\nImagine I offered you a hospital bed hooked up to an IV drip. The hospital were able to keep you clean etc. And the drip had all the food you needed, plus constant heroin. And you could go on this, for the rest of your life, would you take it?\n\nThis is constant bliss happiness, why would you say no to this?\n\nBecause REAL happiness, includes tribulation. Real happiness includes imperfections and ups and downs.\n\nImperfections are what make things real. Real happiness comes from an imperfect life.\n\nHeaven is perfect pure bliss from being in God's presence. This isn't what happiness is, this is just intoxication.\n\n….\n\nPersonal responsibility.\n\nAtheism is personal responsibility and theism, is outsourced responsibility.\n\nAs an atheist, when you do something good, this was you doing it, and so you should be proud of yourself. If you do something bad, you should take responsibility, learn and improve.\n\nBut as a theist, you can always thank God for good fortune or ask god why, when something goes wrong.\n\nAtheism means that ordinary people can take great pride in ordinary things.\n\nHave you had troubles in your life? Did you make it through? YOU did that!\n\nHave you ever helped someone in need? YOU did that!\n\nDo you maintain a house/family/job/relationship/friendship? YOU did that!\n\nIts YOU that creates the world around you. All the little good things, like a tidy room, or a piece of art, or cooking a nice meal. YOU did that!\n\n... \n\nEvolution connects you to life. \n\nPeople sort of don't really consider the ancient past as fully real. I think this is because many things in the past are unrecorded and inaccessible. However, I think this is a good way of visualizing how close you are to the ancient past.\n\nLet's assume there is 30 years between each human generation. So if you're 30 today, your grandparents were born about 90 years ago. So 90/30=3, 3 generations or 3 human beings. Now do this with any number.\n\n2000 years divided by 30 is about 67. Just 67 humans separate you from the time of jesus! That's like a small hall of people.\n\n2 million years divided by 30 is about 67,000 people. That's 1 football Stadium! And it would cover every human in your ancestry, from you to australopithecus.\n\nMe and you probably share a relative in the small hall, but if we didn't, we'd certainty have one in the football Stadium, and you wouldn't need to walk around it very far. And this is a real person, who had a real life and really is our shared relative. We really are related. \n\nBut more than this. You can keep adding stadiums and you literally share a relative with everything living. And again, this was a real thing, with a real life that really is the ancestor of you, and your dog, and a jellyfish.\n\nSo what's the consequence of this realisation? Basically, don't be mean to other people as they are your relatives. Part of you is in them. And don't be mean to animals for the same reason. This is the opposite of nihilism.\n\n...\n\nNon-carrot-and-stick based morality.\n\nWhen an atheist gives to charity, they are doing this purely out of good will. But when a theist does it, is it good will or because they want to get into heaven and avoid hell? \n\nEven if you proclaimed that it shouldn't count towards whether or not you should get into heaven, wouldn't this proclamation be a good tactic for getting into heaven? \n\nWith this in mind, this sort of devalues all good deeds by theists. And hyper values all good deeds done by atheists. An atheist giving a small amount of spare change purely out of the goodness of their heart, would have the same moral value as a theist dedicating years of their life building schools in poor countries. Because one is for a reward, the other has no reward.\n\nI don't even see how its possible to have any morality, if you're only doing good things to avoid torture. When you obey the law you are not acting morally, you are acting lawfully.\n\n...\n\nLife is MORE valuable if it doesn't last for eternity.\n\nSupply and demand. When you decrease the supply of something you increase its value.\n\nIf you believe in an afterlife, then you have an infinite supply of life. This devalues life!\n\nLife is more valuable when you realise how little of it you have left.",

Real happiness includes imperfections and ups and downs.\n\nYet you are the same people who reject religion and God's existence based on evil and morality. Not talking about you necessarily but atheist in general. I would like to ask you if you are ready to accept religion if proven true if it contains things you might not like.\n\nIn any case, this is flat-out false. Atheists lose meaning and are more prone to suicide. No happiness\n\nSo let me paint the correct image of the truth you should accept:\n\n>Personal responsibility.\n\nThere isn't any. You literally have no free will.\n\n>Evolution connects you to life.\n\nEvolution makes you unable to even trust your own mind.\n\n>Non-carrot-and-stick based morality.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo morality at all, morality is metaphysical. And this is an extra:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy43bFoLk6M&t=20s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy43bFoLk6M&t=20s)\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/07/anti-atheist-prejudice-secularity](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/07/anti-atheist-prejudice-secularity)\n\n>Life is MORE valuable if it doesn't last for eternity.\n\nNo value either and a human is no more valuable than a rock or insect and life is just more complex chemical reactions.",

No happiness\n\nWhen you say \"no happiness\", is it your view that no atheist has ever been happy? When you say that happiness includes ups and downs, is it your view that atheists never experience ups and downs? Is this view limited only to atheists, or does it also include anyone who believes in different gods than you might?",

I'm not sure why you think your opinion is proof of not just a deity, but the specific deity of your religion.  Are you saying that everyone out there that doesn't share your belief is wrong?  On what basis?  Because YOU believe it's a sound argument?\n\nJust because we don't know how or why the universe started does not mean that your choice of a deity is the cause.

But also note you say \"if proven\".\n\n>Yet you are the same people who reject religion and God's existence based on evil\n\nThe main reason would be lack of evidence. But the evil thing is because this contradicts another claim that god is both all good and all powerful. So it's not \"evil exists therefore no God\", its \"evil exists therefore theres no all good, all powerful God\".\n\n>Atheists lose meaning and are more prone to suicide.\n\nEven if this statistic is true there can be a number of other democratic and cultural factors at play and there may be differences by country. And note you're taking about atheist, not atheism. If demographics changed and the suicide rate swapped would this make you lose your religion? Maybe these people haven't read my post yet.\n\nRegarding meaning. Yes there is no 'prescribed' meaning, but there can still be meaning. Imagine if I teleported you to the middle of italy right now, for no reason. Assuming you were safe and had enough money, would you mope around saying \"there's no reason for why I'm here\"? Or would you grasp the opportunity and do a load of interesting tourist things? You would have no 'prescribed' reason to be in Italy. No one has given you a specific reason to be there. Does this mean you can't find meaning or aims or enjoyment? No. You just find the meaning yourself.",

It's certainly not something you can just declare as fait.\n\n>Evolution makes you unable to even trust your own mind.\n\n\n\nThe same applies to religion- if your mind was created, how can trust the creator? You might think you do...but how do you know that's not what they want you to think? In fact, I think it probably applies to *any* mind- how can anything tell from the inside if your thoughts are wildly distorted? Even an omniscient being can't know if its actually omniscient or just severely delusional. How could it?\n\nLuckily, like \"what if we're all in the matrix\" or \"what if the world was only created 2 minutes ago\" or endless other skeptical theories, it's not really worth considering in most cases.\n\n>No morality at all, morality is metaphysical.\n\n\"What is morality\" is perhaps the most disputed question. Like, not in any particular discipline, just the most disputed question. Not only are there are theories of morality that are compatible with god not existing, there are theories of morality that are compatible with *morality* not existing*.* Call me suspicious when you're claiming on reddit to have solved a a topic people have literally been discussing for as long as there has been *sentient life*.\n\n>a human is no more valuable than a rock or insect\n\nWhy not?\n\n> and life is just more complex chemical reactions.\n\n\n\nTrue.

There are other reasons to be believe in free will other than a God (I feel free, I am conscious, etc). I am a combatalist so while I think we would disagree about how to define free will, I certainly have something I would describe with those words.\n\n> Evolution makes you unable to even trust your own mind.\n\nNo, it just means my mind is a product of natural selection, which it is. It gets the basics of my surrounding right most of the time and while it fails quite often, that's why we have science and reasoning to correct our mistakes.\n\n> No morality at all, morality is metaphysical. And this is an extra:\n\nSo morality has a metaphysical explanation, but not all. Your moral system can be as simple as \"If I like it is moral and if I don't like it it is immoral.\" Now that isn't a very good moral system, but it is perfectly valid. Morals are subjective after all.\n\n> No value either and a human is no more valuable than a rock or insect and life is just more complex chemical reactions.\n\nWe are a spec in cosmic dust. We are 0% of the totality of everything and to think anyway else is just pure ego. However, I still matter to my parents and my siblings and my friends. If I blinked out of existence, they would be sad and have a worse life without me than with me. That is all the meaning I need, that is all the meaning there is.",
