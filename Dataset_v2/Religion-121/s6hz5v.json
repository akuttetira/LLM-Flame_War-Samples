    "Post_Title": "Religion and viewpoints that are religious should not be taught to toddlers or young children.",
    "post_text ": "I (f19) am an athiest. I normally have nothing against religions or religious people until they begin forcing their ideas onto people who didn't ask for it or don't want it. I see religious families teaching their young, sometimes toddler children about their personal beliefs. A toddler or young child does not have the understanding or resources to learn about different religions or lack of religion. \n\nObviously not all religious families do this and I don't think the typical religious family is really who i am talking about. I'm talking about people who take their young child to church weekly or more, and enroll them in religious daycares, schools, etc. throughout their entire infancy and childhood. The parents who teach their babies bible verses and adam and eve and snakes and whatever. This does not give them any chance to learn about other religions, nor does it give them the chance to meet and discuss beliefs with people who think differently. \n\nIn my mind, this breeds discrimination and misunderstanding of other religons. What if your child wanted to change religion at a young age? What if your \"seemingly\" christian 8 year old daughter came to you and said she wanted to go to a mosque instead of church this weekend? I believe that this wide range of religious experiences should not only be encouraged, but the norm. \n\nPersonally, I think that some or most of this is done on purpose to ensure young children or toddlers don't question the beliefs of the community. I have read many cases and had some cases myself where I asked a valid question during a religious school/childcare service and was told not to question anything. Some arguments I've heard state that an older child would likely not be as open to religious concepts and would be harder to teach, but to me, that just begs the question: If you have to have the mind of a child to be convinced of something, is it really logical and factual?\n\nEdit:\n\nA summary of my main points: \n\nA young child or toddler shouldn't be taught about their family's personal religious beliefs until they are old enough to learn about other opinions. \n\nIf the parent really feels the need to teach their child about their religious beliefs, they need to teach them about opposing viewpoints and other religions as well. \n\nAll religions or lack of religion is valid and young children shouldn't be discouraged from talking about different perspectives.",
