    "Post_Title": "There are no good arguments that same-sex relationships are immoral.",
    "post_text ": "I made a [flowchart](https://imgur.com/a/7jmUK8B) aimed toward Christians - especially Catholics - to encapsulate my position on same sex relationships. I think there is no intrinsic ethical problem with same-sex relationships, and that any other kind of problem you might raise is insufficient to proprscribe them. Below is a text version of the flowchart, but the version linked above is much more user-friendly.\n\nI. Is it a problem in principle or in practice?\n\nIA. In principle. Is it an intrinsic problem for gay relationships? \n\nIAa. Yes, by Divine command theory. Is that judgement based i) some set of facts about God (God’s decision or his nature), ii) some other set of facts?\n\nIAai. Are those facts about God further determined by some other set of facts?\n\nIAai1. Yes. See IAaii.\n\nIAai2. No. Then your judgement is arbitrary and God is not the ground of it.\n\nIAaii. Then Divine Command Theory is false and God is not the ground of your judgement.\n\nIAb. Yes, by Natural law theory. What determines our natural laws/purposes?\n\nIAbi. They’re determined by God. See IAa.\n\nIAbii. They’re determined by some other set of facts. If natural laws are ought statements based on teleology, how did you figure them out?\n\nIAbii1. Deduction or abduction. Is-ought fallacy.\n\nIAbii2. Induction. Problem of induction.\n\nIAc. No. Then it’s either not a problem or consider IB.\n\nIB. In practice. Only intrinsic problems with same sex relationships are adequate reasons to proscribe them. So support gay relationships in a way that helps them avoid whatever problems you have in mind.\n\n-if you think anal sex is dangerous, msm can simply refrain from anal sex.\n\n-if you think depression and anxiety are problems for gay relationships, then they need support systems like loving families, communities, and preventing them from having a partner will just make the risk worse.\n\n-if you think adultery is a problem for same-sex relationships, they need support systems and the same institutional structures for monogamy that straight couples have.\n\n*note to IAa and IAb: depending on your conception of hell, your justification may need to entail that it is GOOD for someone who meets these conditions to suffer eternal torture.\n\n*note to IAb: depending on your conception of NLT, if there is no contradiction involved in God creating something with the sole purpose of harming humans, then by NLT it must be good. If there is a contradiction involved, it may mean you have another standard for what’s good, and you think God’s actions are constrained by that standard.\n\nThank you in advance for your feedback :)",

I find it more natural to simply explain something without having to format it into bullet points or whatever.\n\nThat said, the relationship between man and woman, husband and wife, is referred to as reflecting the relationship between Christ and the church (as well as God and Israel in the old testament). Christ is the groom, while the church is His bride.\n\nThis is why you have passages such as Ephesians 5:22-33:\n\n*\"22 Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. 23 For the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior. 24 Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit in everything to their husbands.*\n\n*25 Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, 26 that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, 27 so that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish. 28 In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. 29 For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church, 30 because we are members of his body. 31 “Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.” 32 This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church. 33 However, let each one of you love his wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband.*\n\nPaul even references that the marriage between man and woman is a reference to the marriage between Christ and the church. The Bible notes that the husband and wife have different roles and different responsibilities to one another, just as do Christ and the church.\n\nTo undermine or corrupt this picture of marriage between man and woman, bridegroom and bride, would be to defeat its purpose and corrupt its meaning in reference to the relationship between Christ and the church. Basically, if the *primary purpose* of the practice of marriage in the first place is to reference or reflect the relationship between Christ and the church (the saved body of believers), then to corrupt that practice by making it between a bride and a bride, or between a groom and a groom, is a corruption of its meaning and its purpose.",

One such as myself might conclude from what you've stated, along with other passages in the NT, that one must have a soul mate and that marrying the wrong person, or not marrying at all (even remaining celibate) is a sin on par with homosexuality. I know you disagree, but why? Can you elaborate how the unity of man and wife is not contrary to Paul's statement that it is better to stay celibate?",

Marriage is not corrupted by not getting married.\n\nMarrying the ‘wrong’ person also isn’t a sin. The idea of soul mates is popular but not Biblical. It’s one of those things that deals with our free will. I believe God’s plan for our lives may involve marrying a particular individual, but we have free will and can choose to not walk that path by marrying somebody else. I don’t believe that would be a sin. I don’t believe it is a sin to do good, even if we don’t do the best.",

But those who are considered worthy of taking part in the age to come and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage,\" (Some might take this to mean that celibacy is a requisite; the wording is ambiguous.)\n\nPaul says in I Corinthians 7:28, 38 - \"But if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But those who marry will face many troubles in this life, and I want to spare you this.\"\n\n38 \"So then, he who marries the virgin does right, but he who does not marry her does better.\"\n\nMatthew 19:8-12 - \"8 Jesus replied, “Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning. 9 I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.”\n\n10 The disciples said to him, “If this is the situation between a husband and wife, it is better not to marry.”\n\n11 Jesus replied, “Not everyone can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given. 12 For there are eunuchs who were born that way, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others—and there are those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it.”\"\n\nRomans 7:2-3 - \"For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law that binds her to him. 3 So then, if she has sexual relations with another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from that law and is not an adulteress if she marries another man.\"\n\nI Corinthians 6:13-17 - \"You say, “Food for the stomach and the stomach for food, and God will destroy them both.” The body, however, is not meant for sexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. 14 By his power God raised the Lord from the dead, and he will raise us also. 15 Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ himself? Shall I then take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute? Never! 16 Do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, “The two will become one flesh.” 17 But whoever is united with the Lord is one with him in spirit.\"\n\nEphesians 5:28-33 - \"28 In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. 29 After all, no one ever hated their own body, but they feed and care for their body, just as Christ does the church— 30 for we are members of his body. 31 “For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.” 32 This is a profound mystery—but I am talking about Christ and the church. 33 However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.\"\n\n(Luke 14:26 - \"“If anyone comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters—yes, even their own life—such a person cannot be my disciple. \"\n\nMatthew 19:29 \"And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.\")\n\nIn the Old testament, numerous commands are given along with punishments for violation. These are as a rule not followed today, with few exceptions. Some highlights:\n\nExodus 22:16-20, 25, 28-30 - 16 “If a man seduces a virgin who is not pledged to be married and sleeps with her, he must pay the bride-price, and she shall be his wife. 17 If her father absolutely refuses to give her to him, he must still pay the bride-price for virgins.\n\n18 “Do not allow a sorceress to live.\n\n19 “Anyone who has sexual relations with an animal is to be put to death.\n\n20 “Whoever sacrifices to any god other than the Lord must be destroyed. (I don't see anyone arguing for war against India to \"destroy\" those who sacrifice to Agni or any other Hindu god. On the other hand, the prior verse was used to justify witch trials.)\n\n25 “If you lend money to one of my people among you who is needy, do not treat it like a business deal; charge no interest.\n\n28 “Do not blaspheme God or curse the ruler of your people.\n\n29 “Do not hold back offerings from your granaries or your vats.\n\n“You must give me the firstborn of your sons. 30 Do the same with your cattle and your sheep. Let them stay with their mothers for seven days, but give them to me on the eighth day.\n\nDeuteronomy 22:23-24 - \"If a man happens to meet in a town a virgin pledged to be married and he sleeps with her, 24 you shall take both of them to the gate of that town and stone them to death—the young woman because she was in a town and did not scream for help, and the man because he violated another man’s wife. You must purge the evil from among you.\" (We are no doubt meant to presume that she could not have screamed if no one was around to hear it, that her mouth was not gagged, etc.)\n\nDeuteronomy 25:5 - \"If brothers are living together and one of them dies without a son, his widow must not marry outside the family. Her husband’s brother shall take her and marry her and fulfill the duty of a brother-in-law to her.\" (This is the supposed prohibition of \"Onanism\" or male masturbation.)\n\nLeviticus 20:6, 9-10, 18, 21, 25 - 6 \"“‘I will set my face against anyone who turns to mediums and spiritists to prostitute themselves by following them, and I will cut them off from their people.\"\n\n9 \"“‘Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death. Because they have cursed their father or mother, their blood will be on their own head.\"\n\n10 “‘If a man commits adultery with another man’s wife—with the wife of his neighbor—both the adulterer and the adulteress are to be put to death.\n\n18 “‘If a man has sexual relations with a woman during her monthly period, he has exposed the source of her flow, and she has also uncovered it. Both of them are to be cut off from their people.\n\n21 “‘If a man marries his brother’s wife, it is an act of impurity; he has dishonored his brother. They will be childless.\n\n25 “‘You must therefore make a distinction between clean and unclean animals and between unclean and clean birds. Do not defile yourselves by any animal or bird or anything that moves along the ground—those that I have set apart as unclean for you.\n\nIt seems to me that the prohibition against homosexuality, or rather of anal sex specifically, is not less arbitrary given your own freedom to disregard these other laws. It seems to me that the only distinction to be found in the bible is that Paul continues to prohibit sexual immorality, including anal sex, but not other varieties of immorality. Indeed, the church no longer even condemns usury (interest on debts). Why are you freed from the culinary and financial regulations in the bible, even from executing witches, but not from the sexual regulations? Surely your body is no less holy by itself than it is in union with a spouse, so your diet should be strictly kosher if you really believe the sanctity of the marital body is why homosexuality or anal sex is wrong.",

Either him or Paul) in a vision. The same cannot be said for marriage or sexual morality.\n\nConcerning the Israeli law, I recommend you do some research into the types of laws that God had given to the Israelites. Some were dietary such as cleanliness laws for eating, but Jesus made all food clean later. This tells us that these laws were not moral laws, since if it was intrinsically *immoral* to eat those foods, then Jesus wouldn’t make them clean (moral to eat) in the New Testament. Other laws were intended to prevent Israel from going to the false gods of other nations, such as laws forbidding marriage to non-Israelites. It’s just important to keep in mind that while some of the laws God have to the Israelites *were* moral laws (notably, the Ten Commandments for example), their purpose was as a set of legal laws over Israel as a nation.\n\nSince my reasoning for why marriage is between man and woman is not founded in the legal laws that God have to Israel anyway though, and rather founded in the creation of Adam and Eve and the establishment of marriage in Genesis, I don’t see how any of this is relevant.",

You're beginning with the end in mind so you've completely closed your mind to the possibility there could be no distinction and Peter was just being hypocritical.\n\nI think you're missing a pretty obvious counter-point as well, namely that both the sexual laws and dietary ones were framed and justified the same way in the OT, namely that it was about purity and keeping clean, avoiding uncleanness.\n\nIf you genuinely think that the sexual laws were about morality but the dietary ones were not, you should nevertheless be able to consistently uphold every sexual law from the OT, not just the ones that are culturally acceptable. You should shame people just as much for sex during menstruation.\n\nAssuming that you do have a pretty consistent, tolerant point of view, that you only view homosexuality as equal or similar to sex during menstruation, you are still defending those who inconsistently use the bible to justify hate.\n\nIf Jesus will forgive people's sins, there's no reason why you shouldn't be able to tolerate his people. If you say that sexually active homosexuals are by definition not his people, so too are adulterers, and all other sexually \"immoral\" people. If a man takes a girl's virginity and does not pay her father for her, he should be considered just as much not a valid believer until he has paid for her, because not doing so is a passive sin. Do you see how your position seems inconsistent and untenable?",

So this is your second premise.\n\n>Him - premise 3: changing the practical application of marriage into a non-hierarchical form would invalidate the symbolic function of marriage\n\n>You - Basically, if the primary purpose of the practice of marriage in the first place is to reference or reflect the relationship between Christ and the church (the saved body of believers), then to corrupt that practice by making it between a bride and a bride, or between a groom and a groom, is a corruption of its meaning and its purpose.\n\nYou stated changing it would destroy the symbolic meaning of the marriage right there.\n\n>Him - premise 4: the different roles in a marriage are determined by the gender of the people involved and not the practical systems they establish based on their respective personalities and through mutual negotiation\n\n>You - The Bible notes that the husband and wife have different roles and different responsibilities to one another,\n\nThis one is kind of on edge and could go either way because you didn't explicitly state that the church is the sole dictating authority in those roles, you just implied it. But this is where that premise is being justified from.\n\nIt's pretty cut and dry. He laid out your position to the letter. Seriously consider that this is what you just communicated.",

Even a lot of the Psalms are prophetic in nature in addition to their figurative meanings as well. Why *wouldn’t* we take this passage literally? It is a letter from Paul speaking directly to the church at Ephesus about the roles of husbands and wives in their marriage. Should all context be thrown out the window?\n\nAgain though, it is important to emphasize the creation of woman. People don’t say “God created Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve” for no reason. Woman’s creation was to be a suitable helper for man, because another suitable helper could not be found. Woman was deemed suitable, not man, and it was this *creation of woman* which led directly into the creation of the establishment of marriage *between husband and wife* in Genesis. It’s about as clear cut as you can get. I’m just not very convinced by arguments that are comprised solely of “Well maybe all of those verses that say that marriage is between man and woman just didn’t mention same sex marriage?”",

This does not build a case for \"corruption.\"\n\nIf you try to pass off said marriage *as* marriage, just as it would be between man and woman, then you are indeed trying to equate the two. Just like how many people in the Bible worshipped false gods. They weren't actually worshipping *real* deities when they did that, but obviously it is still a corruption, as the one true God is the only one who ought to be worshipped.\n\n>I fail to see how calling gay relationship a marriage (even if you disagree with this designation) \"corrupts\" a more traditionally man/woman marriage.\n\nI'm not saying that it corrupts the marriages between man and woman. I am saying that it corrupts the purpose and intention of marriage as a reflection of the marriage between Christ and the church. This goes back to the very creation of woman. Woman was created as *the* suitable helper/partner for man, and as a result marriage between them was created. Marriage and its purpose is established even within the genders themselves. Man and woman are *meant* for one another.\n\n\"21 So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh. 22 And the rib that the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man. 23 Then the man said,\n\n“This at last is bone of my bones\nand flesh of my flesh;\nshe shall be called Woman,\nbecause she was taken out of Man.”\n\n24 Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.\" - Genesis 2:21-24",

They said the survey drew subjects from \"websites openly hostile to transgender youth\", and failed to account for this bias, instead basing its conclusions on the beliefs of surveyed parents who presupposed the existence of ROGD. Noting that Littman had not interviewed the teens, and had no experience working with transgender youth, the GDA criticized conclusions in the initial publication of the study about how teens arrived at a trans identity, saying onset may only have been \"rapid\" from parents' point of view because teens often delay coming out in hostile environments or when fearing criticism\n\nOn the same day that PLOS One announced its review, Brown University took down a press release they had earlier posted about the paper.\\[3\\]\\[20\\] Responding to critics, Brown University President Christina Paxson and Provost Richard Locke said they had not infringed on academic freedom and stated that Brown's commitment to only \"publicize research that unassailably meets the highest standards of excellence\" required Brown to retract the press release after PLOS One opened an investigation on the paper in question.\\[21\\] They said that \"given the concerns raised about research design and methods, the most responsible course of action was to stop publicizing the work published in this particular instance.

Littman speculated that rapid onset of gender dysphoria could be a \"social coping mechanism\" for other disorders.

It is obvious that chemicals contribute to the belief their birth gender is wrong.\n\n>Why do trans people have a much higher suicide rate than Jews in Auschwitz\n\nInstead of just throwing out claims, show your figures.\n\nThen let's compare what other groups are more likely to commit suicide than Auschwitz Jews.\n\nActually, I find your entire argument extremely offensive, I spent the last 10 minutes with tears having looked through various pieces on this subject, I suggest you go read up on it and stop using as the repulsive throwaway line you went for\n\n>The descriptions given above of various types of suicide in the concentration camp clearly illustrate their specific dissimilarity concerning both the motives and the ways of committing suicide. It is certain that suicidal death was a mass phenomenon under camp conditions and that uncounted masses of prisoners were its victims. Like all other types of death in the structure of the camp, suicide of every kind evoked unofficial acceptance on the part of the functionaries.\n\n\n\nIn the whole of the literature dealing with suicide, it would be difficult to find any analogies to many factors typical of suicide in the concentration camp. First, successful suicide was definitely much more numerous than attempted ones. Some analogies could be found in the category of suicide committed by mentally ill persons suffering from depressive or endogenous psychoses, where the co-efficiency of successful suicide is very high (Broszkiewicz et al., 1974).\n\n\n\nSuicide was usually attempted by prisoners who suffered the cruellest harassment by camp staff: They were most often prisoners of Jewish origin, foreigners, white-collar workers, and prisoners more advanced in age. These individuals found it most difficult to adapt to the camp conditions.\n\n\n\nThe lowest number of suicide cases was recorded in the first months of the camp’s existence. Later, a rapid increase was noticed in the first two years of the camp. This was the period of greatest terror, mass extermination, the increased activity of gas chambers, infectious diseases, and pseudo-medical experiments; all these factors combined to form a situation in which survival was most difficult. Suicide was particularly frequent in autumn and winter.\n\n\n\nThe usual motives of suicide attempts were psychological disorders (in the form of depressive-anxious syndromes that could be referred to as psychological breakdowns); somatic diseases; the menace of death; emotional motives; a loss of emotional security; physical assaults; and, finally, patriotic and altruistic motives. The last-mentioned, though rarely encountered, are still remembered as glorious moments of camp history and played an extremely positive part not only during the camp period, but also in the prisoners’ lives after liberation.\n\n\n\nThe most tragic aspect of suicide was the way in which it was committed. The specificity and sophistication of suicide methods resulted from the refined methods of mass extermination of prisoners in the camp “death factory”. Although responsibility for each suicide committed in the camp belongs to the Nazi torturers, the functionaries were most guilty, since it was they who personally forced prisoners to commit suicide. The collectivity of group life and the possibility of inducing common forms of behaviour were certainly the most significant motives of numerous mass suicides in the camp. They were particularly frequent and tragic in the women’s camp. The suicide of the Lachs family, described here in detail, was one of the most tragic pages of camp history.\n\n\n\nBesides annihilation, suicide often had an extremely important function as a dramatic protest against the idea and ideology of the camp. That is why suicide committed in the camp acquired a deeper and broader meaning than those committed elsewhere.\n\n\n\nTo conclude, let us allow a former prisoner, J. Apostoł-Staniszewska, to speak. She finished her questionnaire with the following statement:\n\n\n\n“There, behind the wires, was only fear of life and the courage to die of one’s own will, or fear of death and the great courage to live. Those who managed to overcome their fear of life had a chance to live; those who managed to overcome their fear of death died – the death of suicide.”\n\nhttps://www.mp.pl/auschwitz/journal/english/170046,suicide-in-the-nazi-concentration-camps",

Middle aged cis men have the highest suicide rate compared to any group, I bet they don't care how oppressed the jews were in the holocaust.\n\nI never said anything about \"caring that others are more oppressed\". Your example supports my actual point. If white men are at a higher rate of suicide, chances are the drivers of suicide aren't related to oppression. Since trans people are obviously less oppressed than Jews during the Holocaust, it is likely that their suicidal tendencies aren't mainly driven by oppression, but by other factors.",

If this is to be meaningful at all (no one would be impressed by seeing the sun set normally on the horizon) it must mean that the sun's journey literally ends in that spring.\n\nFurthermore, each of the following passages describes the Earth as \"stretched out\": 2:22; 13:3; 50:7; 51:48; 79:30; 91:6; 71:19; 88:20\n\nThis wording only makes sense if we are to imagine it being unrolled like a scroll. Additionally, just as we might set down some hefty object to hold a scroll open and keep it from moving generally, so too the following passages describe how Allah set mountains down for just such a purpose:\n\n31:10; 41:10; 78:7\n\n(Also, this explanation for the relationship between mountains and Earth is wrong. They are driven upward out of the Earth by tectonic forces, not set upon it. 88:19 better describes this, but that the former three do not at all describe this is puzzling if the author/messenger genuinely understood their functioning and does not in this latter case mean only that they are made to be tall rather than that they are raised out of the Earth.)\n\nAnd the sky seems to be a solid that can collapse on us in fragments: 17:92; 34:9\n\nAll-in-all the views expressed in the Qur'an are closer to the biblical cosmology than to the modern scientific one.\n\nThere is also a puzzling insistence that all things come in pairs, which presumably means male and female, whereas this ignores the very real existence of intersex people and of non-sexed organisms like bacteria and viruses, not to mention the many other things that do not exist in binary pairs.\n\nedit: changed two to three",
