    "Post_Title": "The Taliban are basically Evangelicals wearing turbans",
    "post_text ": "We’ve all seen the horrific pictures and headlines of people desperately fleeing Afghanistan, violent suppression of protests, public executions and  harsh treatment of women and American sympathizers. At first glance, the Taliban are an oppressive and cruel “other” behaving in a way foreign to life in the western world. Upon closer look, the similarities between the Taliban and American evangelicals show that these practices have a long history within the United States. Here are some of the parallels:   \n\n1. The Taliban are a conservative religious group that view the world through the lens of insiders and outsiders. They claim to be establishing peace and security as they adhere to a fundamentalist religious ideology. ————— Christian Evangelicals are a conservative religious group that view the world through the lens of insiders and outsiders. They also claim to be establishing peace and security as they adhere to a fundamentalist religious ideology.    \n\n2. The Taliban denounce “worldly” material such as music, comedy, explicit language and substance use. They have their own schools where they teach proselytes their creeds and way of life. ————— Christian Evangelicals also denounce worldly material such as explicit language, sexual material, lewd dancing and substance use. They’ve set up their own genres such as “Christian music” and “Christian comedy”. They have “Christian schools” where they pledge allegiance to the Christian flag and teach proselytes their creeds and way of life.    \n\n3. The Taliban are known to use violence in order to suppress outsiders and seize control of power. They are responsible for massacring hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians. In 2021 the Taliban successfully staged a coup of the Afghanistan government ————- For hundreds of years Christians murdered heretical sects and infidels during the Crusades. As they colonized America, Christians massacred millions of indigenous people, including women and children. Up until 1968 Christians publicly beat, tortured and lynched people in mobs. They often left Sunday morning sermons en mass to participate in lynchings. In 2021 Christians in America attempted a coup, storming the Capitol building, beating and killing other people.   \n\n4. The Taliban uphold patriarchal views towards women, requiring them to cover themselves, restricting their education and social roles. ——————  Evangelical Christians are known for “purity culture”, blaming women for leading men into “temptation”by not covering themselves, upholding traditional views that women should not be in leadership, preach in churches and should submit to their husbands in defined roles at home and with family   \n\n5. The Taliban have been known to enslave and rape other people, particularly women. —————— Though not directed towards women, for hundreds of years Christians enslaved and raped African Americans.  Women were not given a right to vote until 1920 in America.    \n\n6. The Taliban have proven to use violence to suppress opposition in terms of protest and rebellion. There are numerous accounts of the Taliban killing people for behaving in ways they see as unacceptable ——————— Ignoring the long history of violence in Christianity, just this past year during BLM protests, self proclaimed Christian leader Donald Trump and Christian leader Mike Pence sent military vehicles and personnel to squash protests, demanding “law and order” in a way reminiscent of the Taliban regime. In 2021 a Pew Research Pool showed white evangelicals were more likely than any other group to strongly support the death penalty. Only 9% strongly opposed the death penalty compared to 34% of self-identified atheists. Clearly Evangelicals are willing to use violence.     \n\nTo be fair, the Taliban are more conservative than Evangelicals. They ban most forms of art, sports and technology. They require prayer under the threat of punishment and restrict women from receiving education. They also restrict free speech more than Evangelical Christians do, at least in an explicit way. With that being said, who knows what America would look like if Christians successfully staged a coup. They’ve proven to fight tooth and nail to censure education, “keep God in schools” and repress movements for a more equal society such as LGBTQ, BLM, and Medicare for all. To be fair also, Christians have been reforming through the last century, mostly changing their stance on slavery and beginning to shift on LGBTQ and women’s equality. The Taliban may be more similar to Christians in America 150 years ago. Maybe in 150 years the Taliban will turn to political and economic means to gain power and use less violent means like Evangelicals have. Nonetheless, the two groups are more similar than they are different.",

Even though arguably Muhamad preached that the gospels were sent from allah and nobdy can change Allahs words, muslims today and throughout history have denied the christian scriptures as being corrupted.\n\nThe biggest difference is our view on Jesus. Jesus in christianity is divine son of God who is the only way to have forgiveness of sins. Where as in Islam Jesus is just a prophet and to have forgiveness of sins you have to follow and believe in Muhamad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou have to deal with the ideologies and religious doctrine. The taliban are a faithful representation of 7th century Islam, while American slave owners who raped their female slaves are not a faith representation of christianity and I can show biblically why they are going to hell.",

If so, how is the OT completely different?\n\nAs far as American slave owners, the Bible is clearly not against slavery.  It even places slavery higher than marriage in Exodus 21, which talks about enslaving fellow Israelites.  There we find that if a Hebrew slave was married while in slavery, he is to go out (free) by himself, leaving his wife and children to his master.",

The timing of the ultimate return is left unknown.  The NT, for example in parables, speaks of delay, a need for watchfulness, etc.  All things were accomplished at the cross, the climax.  The rest is denouement and resolution within the narrative.  The purpose of the remainder of time is for the full number of people to come in by faith.  We see all this when we analyze the NT.  Whatever Jesus did not perform or fulfill at his first coming will be completed when he returns.  There, the remainder of prophecy and everything ever said will find ultimate, final fulfillment.  The time in between is the last days.  We see this all throughout the NT.",

It seems like it says \"if you can get free, do it...but like...whatever....\"\nThe point of christianity is very much that this life doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things - so why would it matter if you're a slave to a man...you're free in christ...and if you're free in society, dont' think you're so cool because you're a slave to christ...\nit's a nothing sandwitch.\nAlso, this chapter also says that a woman or man cannot refuse sex with their partner - this means that they can be forced to have sex. that's rape.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Ephesians 6 tells masters to treat their slaves in love basically.\n\nEphesians 6 doesn't say to free your slaves, does it?\nSlavery isn't only immoral because of the threat of allowed violance that comes with it. it's immoral because a human being should not be owned as property; that is immoral.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Jesus established male / female monogamy in marriage in matthew 19.\n\nJesus just talked about marriage in here. where does it say that a slave owner cannot have sex with his slave?\neven IF there is a passage that says this, which I'm not aware of, the NT still does nothing to say slavery is immoral.",

I think the bible is just ancient myth from 2000+ years ago and provides zero value to understanding the natural world around us. Just like all other literature it can teach us about the mindset of humans of the time and perhaps some lessons which can be applied to our lives today.",

And I dont think you are saved if you are living in unrepentant sin. So its not inherently sinful to be a slave master. But that doesn't mean there arent sins that can stem from a slavery system like kidnapping slaves which bible prohibits as manstealing in both covenants, sexual violations, and doing other evils to your slave. The standards for a good master in ephesians 6 specifically says for masters to not threaten their slaves.",

Because this example is not of a betrothed woman and the bible doesn’t give a shit about women.\n\nThere were two previous examples of a betrothed woman; one in the city and one not in the city. In the city, the assumption is if she’d have cried out he would have stopped or been stopped - completely ignoring that he might threaten her with violence - and they both are killed; the second is outside the city and even if she yelled out, there’s no one to hear it. But - and here’s the interesting part - all this is dependent on her being betrothed to be married. The next example - the one I brought up - is about a non-betrothed maiden and mentions nothing of her consent because it doesn’t matter as she’s not betrothed. This guy isn’t ruining a soon to be marriage - so he pays the fee to the father and it’s all good. Because the bible doesn’t give a shit about women.\n\nLearn you bible.",

If God is self-sufficient, he wills nothing, he doesn't need anything. No reason to create/do anything.\n\nIn christianity, God's nature is Love, the triune God explains this love.

Jesus did that in matthew 19 going back to genesis. The NT also emphasizes that women men and all races are image bearers of God. And there is a standing command to love your neighbors.\n\nSo there is no room for rape without repentance in the NT unless you dont actually believe in it.

He was a warmongering Jew that hated Roman occupation lmao, not some prophetic martyr for your religious redemption.\n\nAnd why wouldn’t you lump Christianity into the same fold as Islam? Both encourage backwards thinking and an outdated view on society. They are the two religions that have caused the most long term damage and repression of science and art to the world.

In fact Jesus said his kingdom is not on earth and if it was he would defend it with sword instead of going to the cross. Same cannot be said about Muhamad's offensive Jihad though.\n\n\nAbout slavery 1 corinthians 7:21-23 is all you need to know about slavery. Its obvious a post slavery society is ideal for christian doctrine with scriptures like if you can gain your freedom do so and dont become slaves of human beings. But if you are a slave your duty is to represent christ and bring your master to Jesus through your good works and representing the gospel as a slave which is why the obedience scriptures exist.\n\nLuke 14 is symbolic again. It just basically means if you are a christian and your parents are islam, you got to stand for the gospel, etc.\n\nThere is still a standing command to love, Jesus established hereosexual monogamy as the standard in matthew 19. The same apostle said to love your wife as you love the church. Personally I think the timothy verse applies to women not being church leaders but not applying society in general.

Either way, slavery shouldn’t exist, it is not a slave’s duty to bring his master to christ lmfao. A loving god would not put his people into a slavery situation in the first place.\n\nNot once does the Luke verse mention another religion in hating your parents, and Islam doesn’t come around for another 500 years. If it was talking about other religions, it would likely reference some form of Pagan worship. It is supposed to mean you love god more than your own family, and that it’s better to hate your parents to love god (it isn’t).\n\nHeterosexual monogamy is a dumb standard to live life by in a modern secular society. It’s outdated and not needed in today’s world with the science and technology we have. Why can’t women be church leaders? Do they not deserve a close relationship to serve their duty to your god?\n\nSemantics man. Accursed is essentially wishing harm on them.
