    "post_text ": "In order for something to be either moral or immoral, it must be a choice. Homosexuality, not being a choice, means that it is amoral, it exists outside the scope of morality. You can no more assign a moral value to homosexuality than you can to the color of someone's hair, or how tall they are. \n\nMany theists will insist that Homosexuality is a choice, and therefore we can assign a moral value to it. However, all of the scientific evidence indicates it is not a choice. This is from the APA [https://www.apa.org/topics/lgbtq/sexual-orientation](https://www.apa.org/topics/lgbtq/sexual-orientation)\n\nThe question for theists who say that homosexuality is a choice, how do you square this belief with all of the scientific evidence indicating otherwise, and all of the personal anecdotal evidence from homosexuals explaining it is not a choice. \n\nSecond question for theists, how do you explain the choice of people to be homosexuals, given the horrific social implications that brings with it. Why would anyone choose to be gay in Iran for example, and risk being stoned to death.",

There are dozens of instructions in the Bible clearly stating that you shouldn't charge interest (except *maybe* to foreigners) with never a peep about the amount.\n\nIt is a gotcha, you guys who have spent decades pretending the reason you campaign against equal rights for gay people is scriptual rather that based purely on low bigotry. The number of things you should come for before gay people if what you care about is what Yahweh wants is long. First, remove the beam out of your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck out of your brother's eye.\n\n\n*Exodus 22:25* “If you lend money to any of my people with you who is poor, you shall not be like a moneylender to him, and you shall not exact interest from him.\n\n\n*Ezekiel 18:13*\nLends at interest, and takes profit; shall he then live? He shall not live. He has done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon himself.\n\n\n*Ezekiel 18:17* Withholds his hand from iniquity, takes no interest or profit, obeys my rules, and walks in my statutes; he shall not die for his father's iniquity; he shall surely live.\n\n\n*Leviticus 25:36* Take no interest from him or profit, but fear your God, that your brother may live beside you.\n\n\n*Deuteronomy 23:19-20* “You shall not charge interest on loans to your brother, interest on money, interest on food, interest on anything that is lent for interest. You may charge a foreigner interest, but you may not charge your brother interest, that the Lord your God may bless you in all that you undertake in the land that you are entering to take possession of it.",
