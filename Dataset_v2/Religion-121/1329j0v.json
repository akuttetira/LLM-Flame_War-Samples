Many people are fine arguing that these Hadiths are forgeries or that they do not represent truth etc. basically that line of apologetics is fine, but the Muslim apologetics community should be completely hostile to arguments which accept that this happened and there was nothing morally wrong with it. This sort of apologetic needs to die out.\n\nOnce again, not anti-Islam, just anti child bride apologetics. Also, it doesn’t matter if the same is the case in the Bible or canon law. Any defence that takes this line should be seen as offensive and fringe",

It can certainly qualify as “studies,” but it’s about as important as someone who studies lord of the rings lore.\n\nMost Muslims I’ve seen here like to specifically divorce hadiths from the Quran, because it kinda delegitimizes it in a real way with regards to the religion being overall “peaceful”. The Hadith’s are where the religion becomes truly wicked and evil, like with apostasy. If anything, they’re a stain on an otherwise fairly decent religious text. Better than the Bible, at least.\n\nYou really want to lean on them to support an argument about a weird “prophet” screwing a child?  That’s pretty fun.",

I actually left Mormonism when I learned that Joseph Smith married and had sex with a fourteen year old in the 1800s. I think reacting with revulsion to this is a good thing. So why would Allah let his representative do something knowing modern people would view it as abhorrent and conclude that Islam must be false?
