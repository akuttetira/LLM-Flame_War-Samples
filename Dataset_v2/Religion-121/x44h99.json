We don't have half of anything ever, we start with extremely simple and end up with extremely complex over gigantic periods of time.\n\nAs for the word \"random,\" the only random thing in evolution is the genetic mutation occuring in DNA during cellular reproduction.

Your sloppy use of language needs to “be more precise” if you want better answers!\n\n>Go back in time, say to the time where there are some replicating molecules. At what point a population starts to exist and why?\n\n- There are lots of ways populations can diverge and separate. Geographical isolation is one of the main ones.\n\nEx: A bunch of cells are replicating in a small coastal pool and a wave comes along and washes some of them into another adjacent  pool. Now that one population was split into two pools to make two different populations by this wave. The environments in each pool could be slightly different leading to a slightly different population evolving accordingly. Now you take that new population and do it again with another wave, and now that new pool is a slightly different environment than the previous one and even more different from the original…. And on and on and on.\n\nEX: A bunch of cells are replicating through different depths in the water column, populations replicating closer to the surface will be exposed to more sunlight than ones replicating at the bottom of the ocean. That separation and divergence can just get more extreme with more time. The bottom dwellers start adapting to living in sea floor mud and the top dwellers start adapting to shallow pools on the beach or even eventually outside water.\n\nAn earthquake could split a population, a stream of lava from a volcano could split a population, the development of a new river could split a population, light and shadow could even split a population. Underground or above ground could split a populations. Underwater or above water could split a population. Do I really need to go on?\n\nEvolution is in no way lacking mundane mechanism to separate and split populations with.",

That is a further problem of evolution.\n\n>Things exist at multiple scales. Larger scales demonstrate emergent properties from their constituent parts. Those emergent properties are every bit as real as the interactions between fundamental particles. It is far more useful to characterize the behavior of an animal in terms of its genetics, biology, and its behavior than the movement of electrons in its countless atoms. And more useful to characterize the changes in a large population of genetically similar organisms in terms of its evolution.\n\nWell the term emergent corresponds to magic. Some particles move, puff, you have the rabbit coming out of the hat, that is consciousness, identity, free will...\n\nDo the electrons, protons'... behavior give a more precise prediction if we knew them or the things you mentioned?",

Yeah that’s how you sound right now!\n\n- You’re saying words that sound sciencey but your not actually saying anything. On top of that, what you are trying to get at in the most sloppy way imaginable is actually a question for chemistry not evolution.\n\n>How do you draw the borderline which delimits it? Through your epiphenomenal ineffective consciousness?\n\n- This is just word salad and it’s even worse than the last…are you having a stroke?\n\n- If Jesus is god how do you boarderline his Holy Ghost through biblical ineffective consciousness.\n\n- Again if I were to take your travesty of a comment and try to run it through Google idiot translator it would seem you are still just attacking chemistry not evolution and you have proven OPs point!\n\n“Cell walls”\n\n>Are they more than particles surrounding them?\n\n- Oil and water are “just particles” that doesn’t stop them from not mixing.\n\n- Magnets are “just particles” that’s doesn’t stop them from attracting or repealing each-other.\n\n- Your fundamental lack of basic science doesn’t deny the mountains of evidence that in reality different “particles” have nontrivial interaction with eachother that can and do results in complex and distinctive systems. I’m sorry you don’t like it!\n\n>After all particles since the big bang bumped one onto other and randomly they look like cell walls. No?\n\n- Your not questioning evolution at this point your questioning basic chemistry and your question should be posed to chemist and organic chemists not people defending evolution.\n\n- For the sake of argument let’s say time traveling geneticists from earths future some how came back in a time machine to primordial earth and put the first self-replicating cell with cell walls on earth. Evolution wouldn’t change one bit, you would still be an ape and all life on earth would still be descendants from that first cell.\n\n“Define identity”.\n\n>You define it. Since you say populations consisting of individual organism evolve.\n\n- I’m not actually saying that, but even if I was I wouldn’t have to define identity because “individual” and “identity” are NOT the same thing smart guy…. Keep up!\n\n- That IS actually wrong, evolution doesn’t happen to individuals it happens to populations.\n\n>I may say if i am materialist atheist that there are just particles bumping one onto other since the bing bang amd our alleged observations about the upper layers are no more than ineffective useless illusions.\n\n- If you were completely ignorant of chemistry or were an idiot creationist on the losing end of a debate I supposed you could say that.\n\n“Pls don’t tell me your referring to the long debunked twister through a junkyard creationist analogy.”\n\n>I never had the idea of that analogy here.

Emergence alone undoes the unspoken assumptions behind this question.\n\n>How do you draw the borderline which delimits it? Through your epiphenomenal ineffective consciousness?\n\nThese questions are also moot.  The first is already answered and the second is solipstic claptrap.\n\n>Are they more than particles surrounding them?\n\nIf you already understand \"particles\" and \"surrounding\" then you know no more is needed.\n\n>After all particles since the big bang bumped one onto other and randomly they look like cell walls. No?\n\nNo.  Your understanding of chemistry is bad and you should feel bad.\n\n>You define it.\n\nSo you can't define identity; you're just trying to use it as a gotcha term, check.\n\n>Since you say populations consisting of individual organism evolve.\n\nIf you are having trouble with the concept of individual organisms I suggest starting with a remedial kindergarten class.  They will also teach you what sounds said organisms make.\n\n>I may say if i am materialist atheist that there are just particles bumping one onto other since the bing bang amd our alleged observations about the upper layers are no more than ineffective useless illusions.\n\nNone of this follows nor holds any relevance.

Someone can give you a one sentence definition, but you really won’t know what they’re talking about unless you understand all of the underlying principles and processes involved in that theory.",
