    "Post_Title": "The whole \"72 virgins\" in Islamic heaven concept was most likely something Muhammad came up with to convince his followers to fight in battle, rather than a divine revelation",
    "post_text ": "Thesis argument introduction: In Islam, it is said that if you are a man, when you die, you will receive fair skinned virgins in heaven, and your wife whom you had on earth will be the queen of these virgins. These virgins are essentially your mindless servants whom you can use to sexually please yourself. This is a mainstream Islamic concept, and they are commonly referred to as hoor al ayn by Muslims.  **To clear up a misconception some people have, every Muslim male who goes to heaven will have these virgins available to him, not just martyrs. A man's wife doesn't get any male virgin companions of her own, the only person she's allowed to be with in heaven is her husband, while her husband can be with 72 other virgin girls**\n\nHere are some of the characteristics of these virgins according to Islamic scriptures:\n\nThey will remain virgins forever.....even after you have sex with them\n\nThey will have wide lovely eyes\n\nThey have will fair skin\n\nThey will be completely hairless except for their brows and head\n\nThey will be eternally young\n\nTheir skin will be transparent enough where you can see the marrow of their bones (yeah I don't know why....)\n\nThey will never menstruate/defecate/urinate\n\nThey will have large breasts and appetizing vaginas\n\nThey are pretty much mindless sex dolls, they have a modest gaze, and only seek to serve the Muslim man who becomes their husband in heaven\n\n\n\n**Quran 37:48-49:** ( The Quran is talking about the things you will get in heaven here including wine and what not)\n\n&gt;**And with them will be maidens of modest gaze and gorgeous eyes, as if they were pristine pearls.**\n\n**Quran 38:52**\n\n&gt;**And with them will be maidens of modest gaze and equal age.  This is what you are promised for the Day of Reckoning.**\n\n**Quran 44:51-54**\n\n&gt;Indeed, the righteous will be in a secure place,  amid Gardens and springs,  dressed in fine silk and rich brocade, facing one another.  So it will be. **And We will pair them to maidens with gorgeous eyes.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**And we wed them unto fair ones with wide, lovely eyes.** . . .[Quran 52:17-20](https://quranx.com/52.17-20)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**In them (heaven) are women limiting \\[their\\] glances, untouched before them by man or jinnī** \\-  As if they were rubies and coral.1 **Quran 55:56**\n\n\n&gt;**In them are good and beautiful women -  So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny? -  Fair ones reserved in pavilions -** (Quran says houris in original arabic translation to refer to houris, resereved in pavillions means that the houris will have a modest gaze and not look to serve anyone besides the man) **Quran 55:70-72**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**And \\[for them are\\] fair women with large, \\[beautiful\\] eyes,  The likenesses of pearls well-protected, Quran 56:22-24**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Indeed, We have produced them \\[i.e., the women of Paradise\\] in a \\[new\\] creation,  And made them virgins,  Devoted \\[to their husbands\\] and of equal age, Quran 56: 35-37**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Indeed, for the righteous is attainment,  Gardens and grapevines,  And full-breasted \\[companions\\] of equal age.  Quran 78:31-33**\n\n\n\n&gt;**\" everyone will have two wives from the houris, (who will be so beautiful, pure and transparent that) the marrow of the bones of their legs will be seen through the bones and the flesh.\" Sahih Bukhari 3254**\n\n\n\n&gt;Anas narrated that the Prophet (s.a.w) said: \"The believer shall be given in paradise such and such strength **in intercourse**.\" it was said: \"O Messenger of Allah! And will he able to do that?\" He said: \"**He will be given the  (sexual) strength of a hundred.**\"  [Jami\\` at-Tirmidhi 4:36:253](https://quranx.com/Hadith/Tirmidhi/DarusSalam/Volume-4/Book-36/Hadith-2536/)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**“The first group to enter Paradise will enter with (faces) like the moon in the night when it is full. Then those who follow them will be shining with a light brighter than the brightest star in the sky. They will not urinate or defecate, or blow their noses or spit.   Sunan Ibn Majah 4333**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There is no one whom Allah will admit to Paradise but **Allah will marry him to seventy-two wives**, two from houris and seventy from his inheritance from the people of Hell, **all of whom will have desirable** front passages (vaginas)  [Sunan Ibn Majah 5:37:4337](https://quranx.com/Hadith/IbnMajah/DarusSalam/Volume-5/Book-37/Hadith-4337/)\n\n\n\n**Thesis argument continued:** In many parts of the world, including Arabia, back then and even now, there was a very large emphasis on the virginity of a woman, and virgin women were desired and considered the best option for a marriage. Therefore, it seems likely that Muhammad emphasized the virginity of these heavenly creatures to entice his followers to obtain numerous beautiful virgin women and encourage them to fight in battle. When Muhammad moved to Medina from Mecca, he engaged in multiple millitary campaigns against the pagan Quraysh, the dominant tribe of Mecca, his home place. Muhammad had gone from a public preacher to a millitary commander, and was rapidly recruiting men to participate in battles and have a share in the loot they captured from various tribes and caravans. In order to boost their morale during battles, this was something that Muhammad came up with\n\nIn fact Muhammad for the most part describes heaven pretty much as life on Earth, just with much more facilities and luxuries, such as rivers of honey and milk, dates and plentiful fruits available, having good wine, and silk and clothes, and giant palaces, and of course 72 virgins. Muhammad describes heaven as life on Earth to, in my opinion, calm the fears of his men, so they know that if they die, they will still get to enjoy a life similar to the on Earth.\n\nNow if I did believe in a God, which I dont, but if I did, I would think its fine for there be to sex in heaven.  I dont think there is anything ungodly about that. But the problem for me arises with the fact that there are 72 mindless servants that you do it with, it seems bizzare and out of place. It seems like the fantasy of a teenage boy, and not the divine command of a God. It seems far too obscene and chasing after your primal, lustful desires for heaven.\n\nWomen also get the short end of the stick in Islamic heaven, they dont get to be with 72 mindless boy virgins, they become the queen of their husband's virgins, which I find deeply disrespectful and insulting, instead of women becoming empowered and liberated in Islamic heaven, they are still under the control of their husbands and relegated to the leader of her husband's sex toys. The hadith below also proves that Muhammad used houris to control the behaviour of women on Earth\n\n\n&gt;**The Messenger of Allah said: \"No woman annoys her husband but his wife among houris (of Paradise) safs: 'Do not annoy him, may Allah destroy you, for he is just a temporary guest with you and soon he will leave you and join us.\"'    Sunan Ibn Majah 2014**\n\n\n\nIN CONCLUSION: I am not convinced that these 72 virgins are a divine revelation from God because it seems far too obscene and chasing after lustful desires, although I'm not against the idea of sex in heaven, 72 mindless sex servants seems more like a fantasy of men rather than a godly intervention. Muhammad most likely came up with this idea to recruit more men into his army, and the whole concept is highly degrading and insulting to women. It is not fair to relegate women to the position of the queen of her husband's sex dolls and seems to restrict women's liberties and potential in heaven. Muhammad also described heaven as life on Earth, but with better facilities, luxuries and resources to make his men  more comfortable with dying and to boost their morale\n\nI am genuinely open to hearing counter points from Muslims as to why it makes sense that this most likely comes from God, and not a clever millitary leader",

            "Reply_Text": "I am a Muslim, but I am not going to come into with this from Islamic background, just logical background. First of all, I don't see anything wrong with sex in heaven. Everyone will be beautiful in Heaven according to Islam, and wife of this life will be better looking than the Houri's. Everyone in Heaven won't defecate or get sick btw.\n\nNow to the point, you are assuming people in Arabia are naive and will sign up for death because of a promise of women. Even though many of them rejected his message and called him crazy or thought of him as mentally ill. Many of them didn't believe in afterlife too. They were still conservative when it came to pre-marital relations, and they married several wives at the time, so they were not lacking when it came to sexual gratification. They were also desert tribal people who were not afraid of battle like you think that they needed a promise to convince them to fight and die. They fought and died before Islam as well.\n\nAnother thing is you need to understand concept of martyrdom in battle. It's based upon intention. Not just simply fight and die in battle with Muslims. And also understand there are many kinds of martyrs that don't involve dying in battle.\n\nThat is why in my opinion I can't make sense of this argument logically. Also what is obscene about it? They are your legal wives in Heaven, cannot be shared(no cheating), and it is a pleasure for our patience on earth where we abstain from pre-martial sex. People on earth have dozens of partners unlawfully(if we go by Abrahmic faiths). Often times via temporary hookups, or cheating on their partners. In Heaven, you have those partners forever(is not a limited time), and they are married to you, there is no sharing them with other guys, no cheating or temporary hookups. They are your lovers forever, which is a good and beautiful thing, and not obscene, imo. Islam is not against intimacy, it just has to be within marriage.",

There is no jealousy in heaven, women will not be jealous that their husbands have wives in heaven made of light. They are a different creation and the human wife has higher status. Sex within marriage is very good and healthy. And there is no cheating in heaven. It will be a beautiful place and everyone will be happy. Unlike on earth where there are temporary hookups and cheating. Heaven is also eternal, men could use more than one wife. Wife does not need more than one man nor would accept that. They are different by nature. Also, some people already had multiple wives on earth and will take them with them into Heaven. There are lots of things to do in Heaven besides be intimate. All that being said, there is absolutely nothing wrong with it, on contrary we encourage lawful intimacy and proud of it. Those same people that complain support hooking up with dozens of a girls a year on Tinder for one guy. They are just against lawful intimacy but encourage unlawful intimacy to the maximum degree. What a clowns, lol.",

Martyrs are not just those who die in battle(drowning in water is martyrdom in Islam, or dying in a fire). And dying in battle does not guarantee martyrdom status. It is about intention. The Houri's are beings made out of light based on what we have in our Quran and what was transmitted about Mohammed. They are not humans from earth. Our earthly wives will be better looking than them and stand out more. Also we are not allowed to share wives. So there will be no cheating in Heaven, nor can anyone come near your wives. And Heaven is not only filled with Muslim people based on what we believe. And we believe everyone is given the beauty of Joseph and at the age of 33 in Heaven. I view lawful intimacy as a beautiful thing. I believe Heaven will be a beautiful place. We have a lot of details about it.\n\nIncluding a market where you can wear a 'skin' which is a different look that lasts temporarily.",

The Houri's or the virgins being mentioned here are beings made of light and not from earth. I do not believe our wives would be jealous or bothered by that, as they are aware these beings are a creation of God to help satisfy sexual desires of men which are stronger than women on average. And these women are lawfully married to them, so it is not considered cheating. Intimacy in Heaven is purely lawful, no one can be shared, it's all within marriage. And these Houri's cannot see the other based on what I read. And there are no orgies, you can only be intimate with one at a time. The sex itself is different too.\n\nSo, these beings(Houris) are lesser beings than humans. Humans are the most superior beings, superior to Angels and Houri's. Because they are given free will and believed and earned their place in Heaven. I don't think wives would be bothered about the Houri's as they know they are superior, and will be craved more by their husbands as they are better looking. And that these Houri's are married to their husbands lawfully, and not behind her back. I think wives will be accepting of God's will to provide males with Houri's(as he is the one who marries them to men of heaven).",

He still has 72 other women he will have sex with and be married to? So a wife has to share her husband (Sounds like cheating to me, but if she's ok with it...)\n\n\nLet me give a scenario. If you only have 1 wife then what if she wants to do something else and you want to do her? Someone has to compromise and give up what they want to do.\n\n\nIf you have all these wives, then your other wives can do their thing while you occupy yourself with the wives that are available.\n\n\nSo this way they get their freedom, and you get your rights. Nobody has to give anything up.",
