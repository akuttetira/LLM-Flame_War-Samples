Let the intruder molest and kill his family and then punish afterwards.\n\n\nOptions B. Incapacitate him before any harm comes to his family. \n\n\nMost sane humans would undoubtedly choose option B when it comes to protecting their family and if they failed to do so they would face heavy scrutiny from other humans. \n\nBut now let’s apply that same logic to God…….satan is the intruder that’s wrecking havoc in god’s house *earth* God not only has the ability to stop satan but he chooses not to for reasons unknown. \n\nWould you then call God a good father? \n\n\n\nMen who walk out on their families get called dead beats and no good all the time and yet those same people who call God a good father never apply the same logic to sky daddy. \n\n\nSome may call this argument trivial but it doesn’t negate it.",

You merely need to imagine a universe which is **marginally** less perverse than the one in which we currently live, and then realize that it does not always take an all-powerful or an all-good being to prevent a marginal amount of suffering. There have been many, many agents who were merely as good as a human, who had access to merely human amounts of power, who nevertheless managed to make the universe a better place. People who have dedicated their lives to doing, slowly and imperfectly, what any halfway competent superagent **could**, and any halfway benevolent superagent **would**, do more cleanly and more thoroughly in half a second. No \"omni-\" anything necessary.\n\nIf one argues (as several users in this thread have argued) that not even an omniscient being could **ever** be capable of reducing the amount of suffering in this world without a corresponding reduction in one's Holiest-of-Holies of terminal values, then one must **by necessity** argue that Jonas Salk did a great moral wrong when he robbed millions of children of the \"freedom\" to experience the ravages of polio, and that Abraham Lincoln committed an atrocity when he deprived generations of Americans of the \"opportunity\" to live and die as chattel property on cotton plantations. One would not be *alone* in making either of those claims, but one should not expect to find oneself in very good company.",

It can be maddening.\n\nSomething that has struck me as odd is the fact that we know that humans have not existed for most of the lifespan of this universe. This raises several questions:\n\n* If 'free will' is so good, why did it take so long to show up?\n* Was it allowed to evolve naturally, or was it directed?\n* Are we to assume there have always been free agents in the universe? If so, are we to assume they evolved or their 'free will' was directed?\n\nI could go on and on, really, because while e.g. Plantinga's FWD is technically responsive to the logical PoE, it is preposterously implausible and unsatisfying while leaving open so many new questions regarding the logistics of 'free will,' all while bding a remarkably impotent *just so* story.\n\n...and never mind that it is not at all clear that 'free will' is coherent in the first place.\n\n---\n\nAnyway, I'm with you, but to actually make any headway with these types we must take the slow path, and even then they are more likely than not to simply abandon the discussion. I have seen it time and again that the most outspoken of these are those who tend to only engage where they perceive an advantage (read: where they think they can convince an unwitting interlocutor, but also where their arguments are quite unsuccessful; they prey on the unfamiliar or inexperienced), but they avoid those of us who actually mount a counter-offensive.\n\n---\n\nFWIW I *do* think that the evidentiary PoE would obtain even with what we might say are reasonable limits on evil or 'freedom of choice,' and that in this vein discussion over the *scales* of allowed evil are pointless. On my view, evil and choice (given theism) could have been limited minimally by causally isolating agents, or by dramatically limiting their ability to interact with one another. To wit, a deity could have placed all agents in the world into Nozick's Experience Machine, such that no agents truly interact, but they nonetheless experience things. This would allow for something like a generic set of life experiences while eliminating various particularly pernicious forms of evil.\n\nSuch a world would plausibly preserve 'free will' while eliminating those evils and while also being objectively better than this world, *ergo* a deity with the requisite abilities and moral character needed to create such a world does not exist.",

Like if the only metric you care about is child rape then we could eliminate child rape by castrating all men and women and banning the birth of any new children. There'd be no more child rape in 10 to 20 years. Is that a plan you would support? The point there are trade offs with everything. You can rectify almost any arbitrary moral issue at the expense of exacerbating others. God gives humans free will. Like what is your argument even? That you wish you had no free will? Do you wish were something other than what you are?",

Surely all the money, talent, and human caring which went into _Game of Thrones_ could have been redirected so that there was one less child rape in the world. But instead, we chose to be _entertained_. What does that say about us humans?\n\nPerhaps God is willing to be scapegoated in order to either goad us into acting in a _remotely_ responsible fashion, or saving up our accusations to pour back on us when God shows us all the times it would have taken approximately 0 more effort to treat humans better, but we chose the option to treat humans worse because it was the tiniest bit easier. Then evil grew and the cost of fighting it became modestly larger than 0. Did we then choose to fight it with all of our being? No. And so it grew even more. Only when it was really, really terrible—like child rape—did we recognize just how evil we are. And by that point, we couldn't seem to understand how to effectively fight it so that the amount of rape quickly goes to zero. So, we decided to blame God for not being a cosmic policeman.\n\nNow, possibly you will say that we humans, being merely evolved creatures quite used to raping each other, simply don't have what it takes. That could lead to a complaint that _God made us badly_. Of course you don't actually believe that—clearly you don't believe God exists or at least is not remotely good—but if you temporarily tried to believe that God created us, you would have to conclude that God did a really subpar job. Have I guessed remotely well? If I have, my next question is whether this stance of yours could possibly be falsified by any evidence—past, present, or future.",

Let me see if I can come up with a different idea.\n\nI personally have no desire to use my freedom of will to engage in acts like rape or murder. If god has the power to create one person like this, then he should have the power to create every person like this, while still preserving freedom of will, and he should have the power to do this for any set of actions or behaviors you might label \"evil\".\n\nCreating people who only do good or neutral acts because they have no desire for evil as a consequence of their nature, which he also created, should be absolutely trivial for an omnipotent and omnibenevolent deity.",

But he could still give us a full range of behaviors from being pretty good to being a complete asshole. You can totally be a bad person and not live up to god’s ideals without committing the absolute worst of the worst actions.\n\nRemoving some actions would not remove free will to choose from the remaining available options. Just as removing one color from the color wheel doesn’t mean you don’t still have plenty of options and plenty of opportunities to pick the right or wrong color.\n\nMaybe at the grocery store I want dragon fruit. But I can’t find it. Does that mean I have no options and no freedom to choose? No, I can still pick a wide variety of things and no one is making my choice for me.",

A judge could sentence a person to have both their hands cut off for stealing a stick of gum and say “hey at least you aren’t dead!” Just because things could be worse doesn’t mean the current circumstances are just or right. You could do this with any bad condition.

I see two options, although perhaps there are more:\n\n1. we're pre-programmed to never choose evil\n2. we blindly trust God and thereby never choose evil\n\nIt's not clear we could ever understand either option. Critically, we wouldn't be making our choices in an _evidence-based fashion_. Nor would we be making our choices via empathy, because we would have no context for what is being avoided. Furthermore, in _this_ world we learn much via destructive testing (e.g. those pasta bridges you might have built in middle school or high school, or [gene knockouts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockout)); how much of that would be disallowed because it would be 'evil', even if only the tiniest bit?\n\nHave you read anything or done any work on why people choose evil in the first place? I've made it a bit through Christian Smith 2015 [To Flourish or Destruct: A Personalist Theory of Human Goods, Motivations, Failure, and Evil](http://www.amazon.com/Flourish-Destruct-Personalist-Motivations-Failure-ebook/dp/B00U8QLY60/), but not to the 'destruct' part. One way to try to imagine a world without evil (_Firefly_, anyone?) is to imagine a world which never incentivizes it in the first place. But that might be a rather tricky thing to do. It might even end up being a square circle—unless you think omnipotence is supposed to be able to make even those? (without [cheating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry))",
