    "post_text ": "People keep saying we should be grateful to God for giving us our life. But if an omnipotent being exist, it is its **moral duty** to create the best possible world.\n\nWe hold people to the same standard every day. When someone e.g has a car accident it is expected from you to call the ambulance because the benefit for this person massively outweighs the effort that you have to put in.\n\nIt takes zero efford for God to create the best possible world. Doing anything else would be nothing but an asshole move. Yet the Christian and Islamic gods expect to be worshipped for that. I would expect such a ridiculous behaviour from a child in puberty but not from a supposedly maximally good, maximally wise being.",
