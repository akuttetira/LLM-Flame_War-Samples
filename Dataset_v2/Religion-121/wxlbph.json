    "post_text ": ">And there is certainly a lesson for you in cattle, from whose bellies We  give you ˹milk˺ to drink, and in them are many other benefits for you,  and from them you may eat. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince science tells us that milk is not a necessary nutrient for humans to absorb, drinking milk is completely unnecessary and only serves to satisfy the tastebuds. Allah clearly thinks we should drink milk, for he says in 21:23 that he has given us milk to drink, but he also created us and made a vast majority of humans lactose intolerant. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI postulate that either this is bad design or bad advice. I don't see another way around it.",

But in this day and age plant base milk sources are much better and simply more nutritious.[1]. One can completely avoid milk and get all the benefits of milk and much more from a simple balanced diet. (Completely irrelevant to the verse in the quran)\n\n2. **Lactose Intolerance**. The main issue here is that fact that 68-70% of adults simply lack the enzymes necessary to digest milk and some diary products.[2]\nIts a very common with Arabs today[3], and was the case even back then.[3]\n\n3. **Hisorical health concerns.** The biggest and the most important problem is that the milk we drink today isn't the same as the the milk people drank back in the 7th century. Modern day milk is goes through lots of processing before its ready for consumption[4].\nDifferent brands fortify their milk with different nutrients and added flavours. Pasteurization, an important process involved in making milk safe for humans by killing the bacteria wasn't invented until 1863. Raw milk is a playground for all sorts of bacteria and an source for many milk borne diseases[5].\n\n\nWhich brings me to my conclusion (I'm only using the 2nd and 3rd point as it makes the first one irrelevant):\n\n*   **The Quran mentions no disadvantages to the consumption of milk. It encourages it as a remedy for \"all illness except Death\" despite the fact that milk itself contains bacterias that causes illness. Alcohol is *Haram* because it is *harmful* to humans, but milk is not?**\n* **The Quran being the eternal speech of allah and for all humans, Couldn't foresee the fact that the majority of the world population would be Lactose Intolerant. Nor did it knew the fact that Lactose Intolerance existed in the 7th century.**\n\n\n***\n\nAll Sources.\n\n[1].https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/experts-is-milk-good-for-you\n\nhttps://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/milk-health-adults-kids/\n\nhttps://sph.umich.edu/pursuit/2019posts/cows-milk-human-health.html#:~:text=Is%20the%20consumption%20of%20cow's,limits%20or%20contains%20no%20dairy.\n\n[2]. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2834688\n\n[3]. https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/lactose-intolerance/#frequency\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2834688\n\nMisselwitz B, Fox M.

                    "Reply_Text": "From that same article.\n\n1. \"Milk is simply not necessary in the diet. Every nutrient in milk can be found in whole plant foods, and some nutrients needed for healthy bones, like vitamin K and manganese, are not in milk, but are in whole plant foods\"\n\"Most plant-based milk alternatives are fortified with calcium and, just like dairy milk, fortified with vitamin D.\"\n\n2. \"Milk is highly insulinogenic, which means it spikes blood sugar levels. It also has inflammatory properties, so is a common offender of acne, sinus congestion, and digestive distress. Milk isn’t well tolerated by many, maybe even most, people. Lactose is present in much larger quantities in milk than in butter, cheese, and yogurt, and many people have a difficult time digesting it. We don’t have any nutritional requirement for cow’s milk and obtain the same nutrients in meat, seafood, veggies, fruits, and nuts. If you do drink milk, because of the hormones and antibiotics fed to the dairy cows, it’s best to buy organic, or grass-fed.”\n\n3. \"Milk is a good source of both protein and calcium. Thankfully, it’s not the only source. You would have to drink three servings to get the recommended daily calcium amounts. Depending on the fat content of your milk, that’s an extra 270 to 450 calories a day. Non-milk sources contain similar calcium amounts, with a lot fewer calories. Other high-quality sources of calcium include beans, canned salmon, almonds, kale, and dried figs. However, if you like milk, I wouldn’t dissuade you.”\n\n4. \"Milk is rich in many nutrients essential for life and well-being. Milk that’s 2 percent fat or less is an excellent source of calcium, phosphorus, riboflavin, vitamin D, and vitamin B12, If these nutrients are not available from dietary sources, calcium and phosphorus are withdrawn from our bones. Can too much calcium be detrimental to bone health? In excess, calcium, phosphorus, or vitamin D may disrupt biochemical processes.\"\n\n5. Milk provides a really nice package of a lot of nutrients — including a few that most people don’t get enough of, like vitamin D. Calcium is important for kids and teens who are still building bone and for adults who need to maintain the bone they have. And it offers filling protein and much-needed potassium. But if you don’t like it, there’s an issue of allergy or intolerance, or you follow a vegan or paleo lifestyle, a well-planned diet can provide these nutrients too. You can get potassium through fruits and vegetables and calcium and vitamin D through fortified non-dairy milks (just be sure to avoid sweetened versions).\n\nYes Milk is good. No one is saying otherwise. Plant substitutes simply offer more or the same amount of nutrients without the **lactose intolerance**** issue. Which is the biggest takeaway from this.\n\nMilk being nutritious doesn't change the fact that 68-70% of Adults are Lactose Intolerant and can have health issues from just 1 or 2 glases.\n\nThe biggest point that OP didn't mention is that the milk we drink today is made by advanced techniques and processes, after which it is fortified with additional nutrients, added flavour and much more. None of this existed back then. To imply that milk they drank in 7th century arabia (or any another parts of the world as a matter of fact) is as healthy as the milk we drink today is simply false. Raw milk is a playground for all sorts of bacteria and infectious disease that are [milk borne] (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/1176784#:~:text=Epidemics%20of%20the%20following%20diseases,paratyphoid%20A%20and%20B%20fever.) (Yes thats an actual term).\n\nThe quran saying drinking milk is healthy is on the same wavelenght as hinduthva idiots saying drinking cow urine is healthy.",

One kind which is the word of God, one which is his advice as a human, third is something unique for him or another person in a situation. We have tools to know which is which, but how did you know exactly?\n\nSecond, the milk the Prophet was advising to drink was non pastureized non mass-produced from cows that was not feed on high diet with hormones. Kind of makes huge difference, and explain why the lactose intolerance issue start to increase rapidly last few years.\n\nAnd last, why people just focus on the very small details? I mean its rather simple, you either belive Ina God capable of creating this whole univerise with its all details from planets to stars to life forms to atoms to dark energy and dark matter. And thus some info about milk would be insignificant, or you don't believe in existence of such diety and no amount of milk will convince you otherwise",

Instead of admitting that the Qur'an is errant, which is the rational thing to do, you conjure excuses for your \"omniscient\" god to cover up for his mistakes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe fact that you call this a non-issue is telling of your heavy biases. Because you believe Allah is as attributed in the Qur'an, any errors, no matter how blatant or obvious, must be misinterpreted because Allah can do no wrong. So, even if it said in the Qur'an \"1 + 1 = 3\" or \"There exists no human with blue eyes\", you would say \"Well, it's not 3 per our understanding of mathematics. So, there **must** be some other way to look at this. Allah would never lie.\" or \"Well, I think blue eyes must be a metaphor. So, it's true.\"",

I mean its rather simple, you either belive Ina God capable of creating this whole univerise with its all details from planets to stars to life forms to atoms to dark energy and dark matter. And thus some info about milk would be insignificant, or you don't believe in existence of such diety and no amount of milk will convince you otherwise\n\nBecause it’s a large stretch/jump from claiming god created the universe, to this god revealed himself to some select prophets and we need to follow the instructions written in a book. If I’m going to spend my limited time on earth going by a book that’s supposedly from a creator of the universe who knows all things, I need to be sure that it is indeed from that being. So if I see something from an all knowing creator that doesn’t sound “all knowing” then that’s problematic. That’s why",

The holy site is in Saudi Arabia. The language it was revealed in was Arabic.
