Now, my Christian friends are attacking Jill Biden, who has a PhD, for daring to use the prefix “Dr.” This isn’t about slut shaming Melania. It is about exposing the double standard. They’ll tolerate a nude model over an educated woman.",
    "post_text ": "As soon as [this](https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-there-a-doctor-in-the-white-house-not-if-you-need-an-m-d-11607727380) op Ed published and got news attention, all my good Christian friends started berating Jill Biden on social media for being a phony and a fraud. “Not a real doctor.” \n\nThey were silent, however, for four years about how Melania posed VERY nude. \n\nThey were willing to tolerate a nude model in the White House, but an educated woman? That drives them insane. \n\nLet me be clear: This is not about Slut shaming Melania. This is about exposing the double standard.",

I figured that was a line in the sand we could universally agree on, all groups should be against child predators.

I remember realizing this years ago when my mom who is a huge conservative did not care that Dr Laura the lady who calls out underprivileged single mothers for not being good mothers on the radio all day did not care that Dr Laura posed in a porn magazine. As long as Dr Laura was good at saying mean things to people my mother didn't like she would keep listening. Trump was good at saying mean things to liberals that she didn't like and so she will always support him. Sorry about my grammar, I'm more of a teller than a speller.",

They don’t have a problem with it, they don’t care when it’s them (Jordan Peterson is just a PhD too IIRC)\n\nAlso, doctor has only ever been a title indicating knowledge. We call them doctors for short but they are actually “doctors of medicine” because being a doctor has nothing to do with medicine unless your specialty is medicine.
