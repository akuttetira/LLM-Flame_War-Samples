    "post_text ": "My definition of a soul is an immaterial entity, separate from our physical bodies, that will be granted a place in the afterlife (Heaven, Hell, purgatory, or any other immaterial realm that our physical bodies cannot access, or transferred into another entity to be \"reborn\"). The key part of this is that the soul is \"immaterial\", meaning that physical occurrences do not impact the soul. For example, death does not damage the soul, because the soul is \"immortal\" and when the physical body dies, the soul is transferred into another form (whether this other form is an afterlife or a rebirth or anything else is irrelevant). We can call this the \"immateriality\" requirement.\n\nThe other requirement for a soul is that it is a repository of who you are. This can include your memories, personality, emotional regulation, or if you have anything else you think should have been included please feel free to comment. I will summarize these traits into the \"personality\" requirement.\n\nSo this brings us to the concept of brain damage. Brain damage is when you incur an injury that damages your brain. Depending on where this injury is located, you can lose your emotions, memories, personality, or any combination thereof. The classic case is the case of [Phineas Gage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gage). However, Gage was hardly the first or only person to experience this, you can find many others.\n\nIf the soul is an immaterial repository of your personality, then why is it able to be damaged by something material like brain damage? Brain damage is not the only way either--tumors, drugs, alcohol, electricity, oxygen deprivation and even normal aging can also damage your brain and alter your personality.\n\nIf the soul is not immaterial, then why is it able to survive death? Why is a minor damage able to damage your personality, but not a huge damage like the entire organ decomposing?\n\nIf the soul does not involve your personality, then in what meaningful way is it \"you\"?",

            "Reply_Text": "Hey, arguing from a Catholic perspective here. This implies that the soul is fully capable of doing anything in the presence of its flesh. You could make the same argument for people who lost the ability to walk, if the soul is capable of anything in the way you’re describing it, then why can’t the person walk? The brain is flesh, a material vector for consciousness. If you abuse drugs for example you can develop psychosis because your physicality of your brain is materially altered. The soul isn’t also necessarily not effected by anything in the material world, but in this specific case, the vector of consciousness (the body/brain)has been so changed as to not allow the soul to be properly expressed.\n\nThis goes for anything, sin included. You may for example have a natural flesh desire to binge eat because your brain wants dopamine, even though you may feel guilty afterwards. Let’s say for example you steal money from your grandmas purse. Materially this is a total benefit, materially you have gained, you now materially in body have more at no expense. The soul however granted the brain is capable of doing so can express guilt within your consciousness. If your brain is damaged from birth or an incident like this, it may not be able to properly express normal conscious feelings of the soul. Again, humanity is by its very nature flawed severely (genesis) and even at full operating capacity we are totally incapable of objectively understanding good and evil. Even without brain damage we cannot do this on our own.\n\nI highly recommend you read The City Of God by Saint Augustine and more specifically his passages on original sin, he goes into great detail about this :D",

Consciousness is notoriously incredibly difficult to define and observe by science. Think of it this way. An engine of a car within itself is not producing its utility. An engine produces power as part of a system of physical objects. Now I may use the utility of these combined objects to move my physical body, but the car in itself does not produce the means of it’s existence if that makes sense. Without an operator, human or otherwise, fulfilling a goal of transportation, the car is useless. In this case the brain is the engine that may produce for itself a vector in which the soul can interact with the world, what you could define as consciousness, but does not produce for itself any higher utility. We don’t need to have this debate right now. If we existed purely for the perpetuation of ourselves we would just eat and sleep and that’s it, like any animal we consider to not have our consciousness. A dog may feel love and want pets and so on, but it can’t feel empathy, it can’t understand good and evil and it definitely can’t think abstractly. The human consciousness behind the wheel so to speak of the human vector is not produced by the physical brain itself.",

It is what causes the locomotion in the first place, based on basic reproducible physics. Anything extra in an engine would be superfluous, and you'd need a damn good reason to believe that something else is at work there. The brain is just the most complicated engine we've seen.",

Nothing else ever observed comes close to even one fraction of a percent of what the human “brain” does, despite medical analysis observations, we have yet to understand what consciousness physically is. Again the driver example is a matter of utility and purpose. If humanity as a vector did not have higher consciousness we wouldn’t talk about this at all. If consciousness was entirely material, like the brain, it would simply only be interested in perpetuation of the body. We wouldn’t debate things like this or sing songs or pray, we would simply operate in perpetuity of existence, just like any other animal. Instead, because inhabiting our flesh is a soul, we are a mixed bag of flesh desires and higher consciousness. Again it’s a matter of utility and identity. Despite the lack of reproducibility, every society no matter how isolated has come to understand in some concept or another there being a soul or spirit or other driving force inhabiting the body. Some think it dies with the body, some think it ascends, is recycled, ect, but all souls are capable of self identification. Other animals sure can recognize a mirror as it’s physical body but no animal can even begin to conceptualize a soul, repeated studies show no animal can think abstractly. As a personal anecdote, I’ve been a dog trainer for 3 years, and no matter how much a dog can love and kiss and show affection it cannot understand itself as a dog, it can’t feel empathy and most importantly it can’t think abstractly.\n\nIf we were to observe let’s say 40 different species of bird and every single bird of a certain order or class does something with no material benefit like praying or debating or doing any sort of regimented ritual behavior you’d say that it would be evidence of at the very least that class or order of bird having a unique feature. Every human society developed some form of religion, not all believed sure, but every single one developed abstract thinking and ritual. This in itself must therefor point to an observable trait causing this in the physical body, but there is none to be found.",

Being able to perceive something more than physical material doesn't make consciousness a nonphysical thing. In the same way a lot of animals also have object permanence, being able to perceive something when not viewing it. Also because societies around the world have developed myths and legends is an argumentum ad populum fallacy, claiming something to be true because the majority thinks so. There are many reasons that societies make up bedtime stories to tell their kids, believing that there is life after death is a way for early civilisations to cope with the fear of death. A higher state of being is just an explanation to go along with that. If you have proper evidence that the brain is stored in some type of magical OneDrive system that stores the data then sure, present it. But the current consensus is that everything the brain does and processes and stores is physically based. Being able to think of things that don’t exist physically isn’t evidence that the brain isn’t physical. If it actually was storing our memories and personality elsewhere then we’d have simple proof of that, because getting your brain smacked wouldn’t affect those parts of your brain",
