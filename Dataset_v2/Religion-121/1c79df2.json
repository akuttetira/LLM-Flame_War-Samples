    "post_text ": "(repost for rule 4)\n\n\nIt's so frustrating to hear you guys compare the mountains of studies that show their work, have pictures, are things we can reproduce or see with our own eyes... To your couple holy books (depending on the specific religion) and then all the books written about those couple books and act like they are comparable pieces of evidence.\n\n\nAnecdotal stories of people near death or feeling gods presence are neat, but not evidence of anything that anyone other than them could know for sure. They are not testable or reproducible.\n\n\nIt's frustrating that some will make arbitrary standards they think need to be met like \"show me where life sprang from nothing one time\", when we have and give evidence of plenty of transitions while admitting we don't have all the answers... And if even close to that same degree of proof is demanded of the religious, you can't prove a single thing. \n\n\nWe have fossil evidence of animals changing over time. That's a fact. Some are more complete than others. Modern animals don't show up in the fossil record, similar looking animals do and the closer to modern day the closer they get. Had a guy insist we couldn't prove any of those animals reproduced or changed into what we have today. Like how do you expect us to debate you guys when you can't even accept what is considered scientific fact at this point?\n\n\nBy the standards of proof I'm told I need to give, I can't even prove gravity is universal. Proof that things fall to earth here, doesnt prove things fall billions of light-years away, doesn't prove there couldn't be some alien forces making it appear like they move under the same conditions. Can't \"prove\" it exists everywhere unless we can physically measure it in all corners of the universe.. it's just nonsensical to insist thats the level we need while your entire argument boils down to how it makes you feel and then the handful of books written millenia ago by people we just have to trust because you tell us to.\n\nI think it's fine to keep your faith, but it feels like trolling when you can't even accept what truly isn't controversial outside of religions that can't adapt to the times. \n\n\nI realize many of you DO accept the more well established science and research and mesh it with your beliefs, and I respect that. But people like that guy who runs the flood museum  and those that think like him truly degrade your religions in the eyes of many non believers. I know that likely doesn't matter to many of you, I'm mostly just venting at this point tbh.\n\n\nEdit: deleted that I wasn't looking to debate. Started as a vent, but I'd be happy to debate any claims I made of you feel they were inaccurate ",

Sure the whole young earth thing had me on the hook for like 3 or four months solid.  I can see where they are coming from. The narrative around the evolution story is pretty weak, and the evidence you speak of is flawed, but I don’t really care. The Bible isn’t a history book, it’s a guide to salvation.",

When the trampoline is flat, the marbles just sit there. But when you put a heavy ball in the middle of the trampoline, it creates a dip, right? Now, if you roll another marble near the big ball, what happens? It gets pulled toward the big ball, right? That's because the big ball has made a sort of dent in the trampoline, and the smaller marble rolls down into that dent.\n\nNow, think of space as the trampoline and objects like planets and stars as the heavy balls. These objects create a dent in space, which we call gravity. When something smaller, like a satellite or a person, moves near a big object like a planet, it gets pulled toward it, just like the marble on the trampoline.\n\nThis pulling force is what keeps planets in orbit around stars and moons around planets. It's what makes things fall down when you drop them, and it's what keeps us stuck to the Earth instead of floating off into space. That's the basic idea behind the theory of gravity!\"\n\nBut hey, if you want to argue that evolution is a stronger theory than gravity because we understand it better, I'm cool with that.",

Cause and effect. There's nothing \"existing\" except the stuff of the universe, doing it's thing. We call it time for convenience, but it's not a separate thing.\n\n\"Distance exists\"\n\nWhat the hell does that mean?

No eternities or infinities involved.\n\nI am not aware of anything ever being created, irrespective of your nonsense/redundant word and your weird attribution to infinity.\n\n>I cannot in good conscience be an infinity or eternity denier.\n\nOkay? Well, I can. Well, maybe not denier, but at least a skeptic.",
