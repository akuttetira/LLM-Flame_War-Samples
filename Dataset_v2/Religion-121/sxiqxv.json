    "post_text ": "The interpretations of the same texts are done in different ways by different groups. There is no clear consensus on what needs to be taken literally and what as an allegory. Christians in the Middle Ages fought, killed and tortured each other due to their differences in biblical interpretations and the overall god's message.\n\nIve asked Christians this before and most of the answers were something along the lines:\n\n>They all preach the same message, and theres no one religion better than the other\n\nYet, Mormons were trying to convert me, saying that Catholics have lost the true faith, the Evangelicals tried to convert me, the Jehova's witnesses tried to convert me. There are about 20 different churches in my town in NY. Few of them dont even have a denomination, they simply call themselves the True Christians, as in, they claim that they understand the bible as it was meant to be understood, True Christians also told me that Mormon missionaries who tried to convert me, don't understand god's message, and thats why they invented their own books on top of the Bible, in order to promote their own separate views.\n\nIf they all preach the same message, why are there denominations that have direct animosity towards the others, and direct contradictions in the text interpretations?\n\nIf (Christian) god wanted his message to be known by all humans, then why is everyone so confused about it? Is (Christian) god not wise enough and doesn't know how to make everyone understand the absolute meaning? Or is everyone just led astray and only one select denomination is the true follower of god? How do you know that your denomination is the True Christian?\n\nWhenever a Christian is faced with this question, they seem to choose a denomination that is either closer to their cultural upbringing, their immediate geographical location and/or their dissatisfaction with the previous religion/denomination. It seems like the choice is mainly influenced by personal bias at the time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Wanted to add a quick link for everyone who is claiming that differences in faith between Christians did not matter\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European\\_wars\\_of\\_religion#Death\\_toll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_wars_of_religion#Death_toll)",

You need to actually provide your basis for this.\n\nYou are right, I did not provide a reason for why I believe Omnipotence was illogical. I was merely telling you what I believed. I was not explaining why I believed it.\n\nSince this is a debate sub, I guess it would be against the spirit of things to not explain my reasoning.\n\nMy main problem with Omnipotence can be summed up with the paradox of the stone. Its a pretty classic argument so you have likely heard it before, but it goes as follows.\n\n1) God Exists\n\n2) God is Omnipotent\n\n3) Since God is Omnipotent he can do anything\n\n4) Since God is omnipotent, God can create a stone too heavy that God can not lift it.\n\n5) Since God can not lift this stone he is not Omnipotent. This giving us a contradiction.\n\nThere are plenty of variations of this theorem, but the point is clear. If God is Omnipotent we must conclude god is not Omnipotent. Thus making the very concept of Omnipotence self-contradictory.\n\nTo emphasis, this only argument only works against Omnipotent Gods. If God has limits to his powers, he these issues do not arrive. Even if God is very very powerful.\n\n>what problem? you havent stated the actual problem. \"Cant exist because illogical\" is not a problem that you have proposed.\n\nPlease see above.",

I already know, just need you to say it so i can confirm my initial point. (this is a hint)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Since this is a debate sub, I guess it would be against the spirit of things to not explain my reasoning.\n\noh how generous of you to grace us with your sincerity, please go ahead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>My main problem with Omnipotence can be summed up with the paradox of the stone.\n\nAgain, this is based on a specific interpretation of omnipotence, which you will need to confirm first.\n\nBut also, it is illogical for god to create a stone that he could not lift. Not only its illogical that such a stone could actually exist within our universe, it is also illogical for god to create such  stone because he doesnt need to prove your assertions which are based on faulty logic in the firsrt place. ANd this will be expanded on further once you answer earlier claims.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>To emphasis, this only argument only works against Omnipotent Gods.

This is an example of what most humans subjectively believe to be proof enough of something--the authority, and mass opinion. If I were to provide a very logical and plausible argument for why god does exist, you would still claim that its not enough of a proof, and would demand to see an extraordinary proof of seeing actual god, when on the other hand, your belief in the TOE or the Origins of LIfe is based on absolutely 0 physical facts and very little plausibility, yet it is somehow enough of a proof when it confirms your bias. Subconsciously, you create the plausibility from your personal bias on the subject, and contradictions within Christianity being the main driver of the bias.\n\n>You are not the most famous person in the world,\n\nThis proves again that your assessment of a proof or facts is not based on logic, but mainly depends on what most of the population believes, youre just going along with  the herd  like the rest of the herd, you do not think for yourself.\n\n>ergo, you do not know how to prove that your god is real.\n\nanother claim based on nothing but your personal bias and herd mentality\n\n>You are just rambling on about nothing mostly because you know this is the truth.\n\nI hope you understand the definition of \"rambling\".

Let me ask you again, for the 3rd time, please quote the texts where i write things that are confusing and inconsequential.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The only thing that you could have said of merit in this discourse is the proof that your god in particular is the creator of the universe\n\nyou have blessed us again with your profound wisdom on what constitutes merit of the discourse. How about you start responding to every single post where i called out your ramblings? you seem to have skipped a lot of those, yet i respond to most of your claims.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Im not going to argue about your thoughts on evolution, they are completely irrelevant to the proofs of divinity we are conversing about. Even if evolution is 100% incorrect, it does absolutely nothing to show your proof.\n\nthey are proof of what i call your biased perception of proof.  if somehow you are not following the logical thought process that im using in these replies, the fault is not in what i say, the problem is in your inability to comprehend, but mainly your inability to have a constructive response to most of things that i say that you do understand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Now you do see why I said you are rambling yes?\n\ni think youre losing even yourself here , with your constant labels of ramblings to anything and everything. and again you need to re-read your own definition of ramblings. If there was anything  i said that was confusing or inconsequential, you would not be able to understand it or have a logical response to it, when in fact you are simply just avoiding having to answer. and No, i dont see where im rambling so far you havent pointed out a single one of them and how they are ramblings.\n\n>Did I tell you that I have super powers?\n\ni think youre confusing it with your mental deficiency and imagining things that are not there in reality.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> (that again will be irrelevant) but what you absolutely will not ever do is provide proof that your god in particular is the creator of the universe.\n\nyour whole point being here is irrelevant, i could report your trash to the mods for being off topic, and youll be going bye-bye\n\nPlease disappear with your trash out of here.",
