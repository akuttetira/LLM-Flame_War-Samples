    "post_text ": "And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and guard their chastity, and not to reveal their adornments1 except what normally appears. Let them draw their veils over their chests, and not reveal their ˹hidden˺ adornments except to their husbands, their fathers, their fathers-in-law, their sons, their stepsons, their brothers, their brothers’ sons or sisters’ sons, their fellow women, those ˹bondwomen˺ in their possession, male attendants with no desire, or children who are still unaware of women’s nakedness. Let them not stomp their feet, drawing attention to their hidden adornments. Turn to Allah in repentance all together, O believers, so that you may be successful.\n(Surah An-Nur, Verse 31)\n\n\n\nThere was no need for allah to restrict women when he could have just  reduced or removed testosterones effect on sex drive since Men have and incresed libido because of testosterone.",

Either critique Islam using Islam, or prove externally that God is evil.\n\n>Would it be ok for me to genetically engineer animals and then torture them?

I’ve read the Quran and understood it…\n\n>Even to this day you guys can't agree. You need to be hand-held by scholars who have essentially hijacked and monopolized the interpretations.\n\nIf you disagree with the scholars, then go ahead and argue against them.

There's a reason ONLY muslim women cover themselves - because they've been brainwashed since childhood to view female sexuality as something sacred and pure.\n\nWhat a garbage claim. I can just flip it on you and say that in your society the only reason women don’t want to cover up is because they were brainwashed into think modesty is bad.\n\n>It's their choice to cover up like that in so far as that choice has been carefully crafted and engineered since childhood by the men and culture around them.\n\nSo, how doesn’t also apply to immodest people? They were brainwashed by society to seek approval by men?\n\n>Free women outside the chains of Islam do not feel the need to cover up to avert the male gaze,\n\nOk?\n\n>that says something about the indoctrination of muslim women.\n\nWhich is?\n\n>Also, I find it very interesting that you assert with such confidence that OP is wrong and that his is merely an assumption - and then you, admittedly, go on to spout nonsensical conjecture yourself.\n\nYes, but I understand that it is conjecture, OP does not.",

Similarly is the case for women.\n\nQuote of Muhammad Ali:\n\n\"When we finally arrived, the chauffeur escorted my younger sister, Laila, and me up to my father's suite. As usual, he was hiding behind the door waiting to scare us. We exchanged many hugs and kisses as we could possibly give in one day.\n\nMy father took a good look at us. Then he sat me down on his lap and said something that I will never forget. He looked me straight in the eyes and said, \"Hana, everything that God made valuable in the world is covered and hard to get to. Where do you find diamonds? Deep down in the ground, covered and protected. Where do you find pearls? Deep down at the bottom of the ocean, covered up and protected in a beautiful shell. Where do you find gold? Way down in the mine, covered over with layers and layers of rock. You've got to work hard to get to them.\"\n\nHe looked at me with serious eyes. \"Your body is sacred. You're far more precious than diamonds and pearls, and you should be covered too.\" Source: Taken from the book: More Than A Hero: Muhammad Ali's Life Lessons Through His Daughter's Eyes.\"\n\nNow, why do you wear it?\n\nIts to feel closer to God.Its why Muslims Pray 5 times a day, to feel closer to God.\n\nTo understand its importance, one should know that modesty has been part and parcel of the Islamic culture all through. Hijab encourages modesty, both physically and spiritually. When a woman covers her head as per Allah’s command, it is her way of showing her belief in Allah and accepting all his commands. It makes the connection between the Almighty and that woman stronger.\n\nAlso, let me ask YOU a question.\n\nWhy are Nuns not criticised for covering their bodies?\nTheir clothing is quite similar to a hijab.\n\nChristian too have history of oppression, sending dis obedient girls to a nunnery.\n\nWhy are they not OPRESSED?\n\nAs for why men don't cover?\n\nPlease see the National dress of Pakistan, all of arab.",

However you example doesn't even make sense because a covered plate will certainly raise curiosity to see what's under it, and whether someone would care or not about what's in it after it's revealed depends on what's in it.",

R\\*pe of captives is 100% halal. Sahih al Bukhara 2542 and Sarah Nisa verse 24 also says very clearly that men are allowed to have sex with the women their right hand possess that is female captives. What a disgusting religion and prophet for treating women like possessions just because they don't believe in your religion.",

Your barbaric religion permits men to take women as prisoners and then r\\*pe them and then impregnate them. A slave woman doesn't become free if her master impregnates her. He cannot sell her that's it. Your religion treats human beings like object. I feel sad for you because you are bound to this barbaric ideology that is totally okay with sex slavery.",

Your Islamic scholars such as Yasir Qadhi agree 100% that Maria Qibtia was a concubine. She was given as a gift to Muhammad. What a pervert he was. He had 12 wives but he needed more p\\*ssy so he had sex with Maria Qibtia on the bed of Hafsa. Just read Sarah tahrim and then listen to the YouTube video by Yasir Qadhi where he clarifies that Muhammad saw Maria Qibtia in the house of Hafsa and he became very horny so he sent Hafsa away so that he could have sex with Maria in the house of Hafsa. This is the man you worship and think is the greatest man to even walk the earth. Look at the evidence and then come and talk to me.",
