    "Post_Title": "The prevalence of abrahamic religions (Christianity, Islam, etc) is not evidence for their validity, and is explained by many other factors.",
    "post_text ": "Most of these only apply to Christianity and Islam - not Judaism or other abrahamic religions. This is not an argument against any of these religions, it is a counterargument to one of the arguments I commonly hear used to support them - that because they are so widespread, they are more likely to be true. This can be explained by several non-religious reasons, however:\n\n**Apostasy**: Most denominations of Christianity and Islam teach that anybody who is not following their religion will go to hell, and be tortured for eternity. Understandably, this makes apostasy rather uncommon - even if somebody does not entirely believe that their religion is true, fear of hell is often enough to keep them from leaving it entirely. In addition, the social consequences of leaving may force even a gnostic atheist to pretend to be a christian/muslim - if they are not, they may be disowned, and in religious-majority countries, they might face discrimination (this is less applicable in countries like the USA and Canada with laws on this type of thing, however).\n\n**Heaven**: What good is a stick without a carrot as well? Heaven offers a possible reward for believers, and a very good one at that: eternal, blissful life after death. Like being on drugs forever! This, too, has an effect against people leaving the religion (and more of an effect on people joining it) because, if they don't, they might miss out on it. If they're [wrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_wager), they'll never know it...but if they're right, they'll go to heaven. Any chance of life after death is worth it.\n\nSo, these are two of the main reasons why individuals will join and stay in the religion: they are scared of hell, looking forward to heaven, and will likely face social consequences for leaving. Now, let's look at some of the reasons why religion itself stays around (that are specific to the abrahamic religions).\n\n**Tithes**: While I can't speak for Islam (being an ex-christian myself), in Christianity, it is customary to give 10% of one's income to the church. This is ostensibly to serve God, but it actually gives the church plenty of money to keep running. If the church is large enough, or wealthy enough, the tithes will actually allow it to send missionary trips to impoverished places, allowing people there to be converted. This, more than any other reason, is why Christianity has been around for over 2000 years - churches are funded enough to both stay running *and* convert new people.\n\n**Indoctrination**: In abrahamic religions, kids are taught from an *extremely* young age that the Bible is inerrant, and that anything that contradicts it is wrong. They are taught that if they ever leave a religion, they will suffer forever - but that if they stay, they will (or may) be rewarded. Kids are extremely gullible (see Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy, etc.) and when they spend hours each week being taught about something, it is no wonder that they will believe it! Kids, for this reason, are the single largest source of new members of the abrahamic religions.\n\n**Procreation**: What good are making new believers if you can't have a lot of them? Both Christianity and Islam teach that people should \"go forth and multiply\" - in other words, have a lot of kids. To this day, members of both of these religions tend to have [far higher birth rate](https://www.pewforum.org/2017/04/05/the-changing-global-religious-landscape/)s than the rest of the population. In doing so, they more than compensate for any deconversion that may be going on. If you have 5 kids, and 1 of them becomes an atheist, that is still a major win for your religion. The birth rates of these religions far eclipse the birth rates of atheists and unaffiliated people, so given these statistics, it makes perfect sense that these religions have grown so much.\n\n**Support**: Religions aren't all bad. Going to church is a great way to make new friends. In addition, if you are an impoverished person living in a third world country, having a missionary come over and build you a new school will probably drastically improve your quality of life! Religion provides a safety net for many people, and given this, most would be loath to abandon it after it has done so much for them. Though not all churches are like this, there are enough that it is a significant factor - either because somebody might need a safety net, or this might be the easiest way of volunteering, or they might like travelling places. The list goes on, and all of these are ways that people might stay with the church despite not believing in it.\n\nAnyway, I think that these are the 6 biggest reasons why religions have grown so large (especially the abrahamic ones) and to me, they perfectly explain this growth.\n\nEdit: I've heard from some commenters here that these reasons do not apply to early Christianity. I disagree for several reasons. Firstly, the spread of early Christianity is very exaggerated: From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Christianity), in the \"developing church structure\" section, it states that Christianity grew by about 40% per decade - which is not at all unheard of. In fact, this *is* entirely possible simply through having many kids who are then indoctrinated. Secondly, many of the other reasons still apply. The church would have provided a strong social safety net, and heaven and hell would have still been a powerful carrot and stick. Finally, Christianity eventually became the Roman State Religion in 380, which drastically accelerated its spread. Because of heaven, Christians had a very large incentive to \"go and make disciples of all nations\".\n\n2nd Edit: I'm not claiming absolute certainty that these are the only reasons, I'm just saying that to me (and to most other atheists) they seem to adequately explain the growth of religions. It's *possible* that Christianity or Islam grew because of divine influence, but given the growth of the other one, it makes sense that there's no divine influence here.\n\n3rd Edit: One more thing that I would like to add is that, no matter which religion you belong to, there are many examples of other religions growing quickly as well. Islam grew *extremely* fast while Muhammad was alive, thanks mostly to his military conquests. Scientology and Jonestown are also good examples of quickly growing religious groups, but I think that one of the best is the [Taiping Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_Rebellion), where a man claiming that he was the brother of Jesus Christ gained 30 million followers over less than 30 years.",

China, India, Japan were never converted. South Korea was (it's now 1/3 Christian) but they seem to be moving toward the type of irreligion that characterizes other first world nations.\n\nI guess I've never understood this way of thinking :/",

One option being reject it as atheist do\n\nso your argument is  self contradicting.  a person could always choose to reject  the evidence as the atheist does.

For me, that says nothing about the truth/falsity of belief.\n\nNote the 90% don't all worship the same god. There isn't agreement even within religions on the nature and demands of their god, as there isn't evidence for any of these belief systems.\n\nThis poses a problem only if you believe that there's one god who will punish people for failing to worship it, cuz you'd expect that entity, more than any of the others, to make its presence clear, giving people a real choice. One such god did it--think Jesus, miracling his way thru Judea.",

You are dishonestly  switching in order to  hide the fact that you can't  present any real evidence for your claim that popularity is a common  claim of christians for why their religion is true. Read the quote again and if the difference between evidence and proof has you stumped look at a few dictionaries. I wrote this\n\n>...the next come back of an atheist is to say there is **no evidence at all** so 90% of the world is open to a God or higher power for no reason at all - Which is an extraordinary claim that requires some evidence itself.\n\nThis sub either has a great deal of non adults or the education system has really let down a number of you.   Thats not saying a religion is true because  its popular.  It questions  the claim that  there is no evidence whatsoever as many juvenile atheists state.  Something can have evidence but still not be true.  a guilty man can have evidence of his innocence  ( happens in most trials or the defense would have nothing to offer) and still be guilty.   In science its the same . You can have  some evidence  for a a few different hypotheses  but the preponderance of all the evidence  leads you to reach the conclusion only one is true  - the rest had some evidence but were not proven true\n\nSo you can stop with the dishonest lazy tactic to cover over for the fact you have no evidence popularity by itself is a common apologetic in Christianity that  we say proves our religion is true . I have never made such an argument anywhere so your attempt to use me  was a flop and you still have nothing.\n\n>Note the 90% don't all worship the same god.\n\nIrrelevant.   You exist in some sense and  people  can have different names and different opinions about you.  This is always a silly  argument made by atheists.   If we  find an alien aircraft in space,  that aliens exist , will be the headline not the name  we call them or  the various opinion of what we think of them.\n\n>as there isn't evidence for any of these belief systems.\n\nOf course there is - you  are just ignorant of the words you use and conflate   proof with evidence.\n\n>Evidence is anything that you see, experience, read, or are told that causes you to believe that something is true or has really happened.[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/evidence](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/evidence)\n\nand proof\n\n>Proof is a fact, argument, or piece of evidence showing that something is definitely true or definitely exists.[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/proof](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/proof)\n\nyou can have evidence of  something and it turn out to not be true ( the person last seen  coming out of the deceased house is evidence of their guilt but not proof because other evidence can  show someone else  got in and left without being  seen) and in many  cases you need multiple evidence to consider something proven.\n\nThe barf that there is no evidence  at all is usually made by atheists  to imply the idea of God is completely irrational  and is taken with no reason ( regardless of whether its right or wrong).\n\nI've yet to meet a theist that doesn't have a reason or doesn't point to evidence. the shtick of the atheists then is to deny its evidence  as i  already explained here.\n\n>What the atheist really means is -0nly what I accept as evidence is evidence and since I don't accept theism there is no evidence for it. Which is just self serving drivel not reasonable logic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>to make its presence clear,\n\nsomething being clear is  a mental state. since there are   more people who find God's presence  clear   in order to show its not clear would need something more than a claim its not by the minority.  Again this is not an issue of proving based on popularity but  on whether you can make the claim something is not clear merely because you deem it nor clear",
