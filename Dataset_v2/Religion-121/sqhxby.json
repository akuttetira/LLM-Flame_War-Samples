    "Post_Title": "Many former addicts who become extremely, passionately religious have not cured their addiction so much as replaced it with a new one",
    "post_text ": "Before going further, I do still agree that it’s good to overcome addiction to drugs, alcohol, and other dangerous and destructive things.\n\n**edit: I’ll try to be more clear why I dislike this and find it problematic. \n\n1.  Religion is making false claims of curing addiction, and I feel this is taking advantage of people at their lowest\n\n2. We wouldn’t respect a group or organization that tries to help cure addiction through recruiting people into a pyramid scheme. We also shouldn’t respect religions that pressure adherents into donating money to them for the same reason. \n\n3. These types of people are easier to recruit for extremist movements within a religion, and I feel again that this would be religion taking advantage of them. \n\n4.  We have all heard stories of mega churches that take someone who can’t walk, have helpers force them up and parade them around stage, then say god cured them. We should dislike how religion treats people with dangerous addictions for the same reason even if the people no longer have dangerous addictions. The problem is with the religion/organization making false claims and using people at their lowest to try to score cheap points.\n\n5. These people are sometimes dicks about religion, like my brother in my example who’s passion for god is matched only by his hatred of LGBTQ people.**\n\nI know this might not be super common with every single theist, but I think it’s common enough to address. You sometimes hear about the “miracle of overcoming addiction”. Sometimes religion is marketed as a way to cure addictions. Most often, you hear it from former addicts themselves. The power of whatever god they now worship has allowed them to overcome their addictions.  \n\nThese people are often the most passionate and zealous followers. They make their religion their entire personality. They are the ones who clearly vibe the most to worship music, often seeming like they’re even in some sort of trance. They are the first to share their conversion story with anyone who will listen and anyone who won’t. \n\nMy older brother, for instance, is one such person. I am not giving out personal info of course but suffice to say he used to be an alcoholic and now he’s the most passionate Christian you’ll ever meet. \n\nThese people haven’t cured their addictions or had them cured by god no matter what they or other religious figures say. They are just now addicted to religion. Religion gives them the good feelings they’re chasing. I think it’s disingenuous to call it some sort of miracle when really it’s just a person with addictive tendencies finding a new addiction.",

What matters is that it lets the atheist avoid considering one option at all costs:\n\nThat it might be real.",

But the original commenter has grossly misinterpreted me, as I tried to explain in my reply to them. I don’t think religious people are all idiots or people who are mentally ill. But I do think addicts, who are in some way mentally ill in the sense of their addiction, are targeted and taken advantage of. Considering most religions want you to give them money, you can see why I have a problem with peddling a cure that you can’t offer. Really anything that takes advantage of people at their lowest I find distasteful. It’s just that this sub is debate religion.",

The premise of the book is ludicrous: 85% of the world's population is mentally ill with an invisible psychiatric disorder unknown to science which can only be diagnosed by one small group of special, gifted people. The author just happens to be part of that group and by an astonishing coincidence they're the only group that believes this mental illnesses exists - and membership of their group is the cure.\n\nIt's amazing that anyone would fall for something so obviously idiotic. But they do, because it gives them a defense against considering possibilities they can't accept.\n\nAtheism is a valid position - but just like religion we have to accept that it could be wrong.",

I find the behavior just as bad as taking people who can’t walk, yanking them out of their wheelchairs, and saying god made them walk, as some mega churches are wont to do.",
