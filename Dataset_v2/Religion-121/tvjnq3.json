    "post_text ": "”Allah“ isn’t even in English dictionaries, and if it is (I’ve oddly seen it in some), the definition is “God”.\n\nAllah is a transliteration of الله. It is not limited to the Muslim God. I’m Lebanese, most of my friends are Christians, they don’t say “God”, they say “Allah” because that’s how you say “God” in Arabic.\n\nAnd in Lebanon at least, Muslims, Christians, and Jews live in harmony for the most part under the belief that they believe in the same God, so we’re one. There’s no fault in that. We indeed do believe in the same God, the Abraham’s God, we just have disagreement when it comes to Jesus and Mohammad.\n\nI hear some Arabs saying “I don’t believe in God, I believe in Allah, get blessed”. Please stop saying that. It’s not even right, it’s more cringe than anything else.",

These are enemies in war, during times of war, not during times of peace, against people who worshipped gods and godesses of sex as well as sacrificing their children and so much more and so much worse, so I ask you again, where’s the mistreatment??",
