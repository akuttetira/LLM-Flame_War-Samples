    "post_text ": "This is one of those questions that if you dive deep enough into your end up with responses such as \"We don't understand God's wisdom\" \n\nBut this is a cop out. \n\nGod has no need to create people solely for them to worship him when he is self sufficient and all ppwerful. He gains nothing from the worship of his own creation. It makes zero sense for God to demand worship.\n\nAnyways, my challenge is: \n\nThere is no good reason why a God would require worship when it does not affect him in any way shape or form. \n\nGod gains nothing from our worship. He also gains nothing from putting us in heaven or hell. \n\nIt is all very arbitrary and makes no sense from a Gods perspective. \n\nIt makes sense if you consider that maybe a human made this all up.",

If something appears designed, they reason, it probably indicates some designer, right? That's a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw based on some evidence, in my and many people's opinion. For many people that's where they subjectively draw the line in the sand and say \"I've seen enough\"\n\nNow, the atheist looks at that and is still not convinced, because he \"decides\" (not saying he's necessarily \"free\" to do so) to draw his line a little (maybe a lot) farther back, clings to his skepticism and posits alternative reasons and hypotheses to rationalize away that appearance of design. \"Maybe there are infinite alternate universes, and we could only exist in the one that allows for it.\" For whatever reason he comes up with, he's not quite convinced. He rejects the God explanation in favor of another.

It doesn't really seem to me like there's any amount of evidence you could show someone like Matt Dilahunty (and many other atheists in my experience) that would satisfy them. They just cling to their skepticism, which anyone could always do for any claim. The line in the sand just keeps moving back...",

It is an argument with no compelling evidence. There is a reason this isn't embraced by the scientific community as a serious theory.\n\n>Many people see that as evidence for a creator. If something appears designed, they reason, it probably indicates some designer, right? That's a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw based on some evidence, in my and many people's opinion.\n\nIt's not perfectly reasonable. This logic is couched in a false equivalency. I.E.\n\n\"We can see buildings and art have creators, thefore god and the universe!\"\n\nExcept we have direct, empirical evidence for the creation of these things. I can research the architect or artist, their blueprints/inspiration.\n\nI could follow the beginning and end of their projects and document the entire process.\n\nWe can't do any of this for the claim that god created all things.\n\nAlso, how do you distinguish the appearance of design from the appearance of natural processes? What criteria are you using?\n\n\n>Now, the atheist looks at that and is still not convinced, because he \"decides\" (not saying he's necessarily \"free\" to do so) to draw his line a little (maybe a lot) farther back, clings to his skepticism and posits alternative reasons and hypotheses to rationalize away that appearance of design.\n\nA true claim will survive any amount of scrutiny, no?\n\nI'd bet my life savings you wouldn't be able to falsify gravity, for example. I don't need to resort to passive aggressive shots when that belief comes under scrutiny because it is so well evidenced.\n\nMeanwhile the language you use to describe atheists betrays your bias:\n\n>draw his line a little (maybe a lot) farther back, **clings to his skepticism and posits alternative reasons and hypotheses to rationalize away that appearance of design.**\n\nThat's an odd way to describe people rightfully questioning a claim you have no evidence for.\n\nIs it not more apt to say you're clinging to your mere assumptions and desires? That you willfully abandon logic for something that feels comforting?\n\nIf you never approached your religious beliefs and claims from skepticism (not presuming them to be true from the get go) why should anyone who does not share your faith find you compelling or believable?\n\n>\"Maybe there are infinite alternate universes, and we could only exist in the one that allows for it.\" For **whatever reason he comes up with, he's not quite convinced.**\n\nThat reason would be scientific models with a basis in reality. These theories are plausible.\n\nIf Christians could provide similar for any of their claims, they would see similar consideration.\n\n>...but for him to say that his reasons for not being convinced, however rational he may think they are, mean that there's objectively no evidence, is the height of hubris.\n\nProvide the evidence then? Why is this so difficult?\n\n>There clearly is evidence to many people, just none that he personally accepts.\n\nAre many people not capable of false beliefs? At one point in history most people believed the Earth was flat.\n\nAppeals to popularity are fallacious and not convincing.\n\nIf his standard is empirical evidence that has held up under scrutiny, then there is none.\n\nWhat evidence do you have?\n\n>I've seen people like Matt Dilahunty go as far as to say that if God came down to Earth and declared he existed to everyone, he would still not be entirely convinced - after all, maybe it could be aliens? Maybe Matt is just hallucinating it? How do we even know this thing that came down to Earth is in fact the God that it claims to be? To which I say, that's a level of infinite skepticism even more ridiculous than a flat earther.\n\niirc, you're misrepresenting his position. He's saying he'd need to undergo a psychological evaluation and eliminate every more reasonable answer first.\n\nThere is absolutely a sad history of people with mental illness and delusions claiming religious experience and intervention.\n\nThat one would attempt to falsify their hypothesis (I had an experience with god) before accepting it is the sign of a mind trying to be unbiased and objective.\n\nWould you just accept that experience at face value? You wouldn't get a psych eval? Or see if anyone shared that experience?\n\nYou'd just accept it as true without any level of scrutiny? Do you see why that is incredibly damning to someone who doesn't believe like you already?\n\nHow would you know you aren't being deceived? Hallucinating? Etc...\n\n>To me it seems clear he's engaging in motivated reasoning, because he doesn't want to believe God exists (for obvious reasons; he's said himself that if God exists he still wouldn't worship him and would hate him,)\n\nCurious you leave out the reason why: because he finds the biblical god to be morally disgusting and vile: Sexism, slavery, rape, human sacrifice, genital mutilation, genocide, incest-all endorsed by god.\n\nHe's considering a possibility you're too biased to ever consider:\n\nWhat if god exists but is evil?\n\nA plain reading of the OT paints a vain, egotistical and bloody god. His objections are not unreasonable.\n\nFor what reason would an all loving god never condemn slavery? Mere existence isn't enough to answer this question.\n\nI too would need to reconcile this before following god.\n\nBut you knew all that when you strawmanned Matt's position.\n\n>so he keeps shifting the goalposts every time someone comes up with some reason or evidence that might indicate an unwanted conclusion.\n\nSource? Is he shifting the goalposts or debunking bad evidence?\n\nDo you just handwave away the atrocities in the bible? Therefore those who don't are just determined to not believe in god?\n\n>It doesn't really seem to me like there's any amount of evidence you could show someone like Matt Dilahunty (and many other atheists in my experience) that would satisfy them.\n\nThere is absolutely evidence you could show atheists, especially if they're science inclined at all.\n\nBut like any piece of evidence in science-it is to be scrutinized and tested to gauge how reliable it is. You don't **start** with belief.\n\nYou are essentially ranting that atheists dare apply the scientific method to god claims while trying to invoke it for your god claim (intelligent design).\n\n>They just cling to their skepticism, which anyone could always do for any claim. The line in the sand just keeps moving back...\n\nI'd argue skepticism is a more reliable path to truth than faith.\n\nIf your god claims can't handle mere human skepticism, was it really compelling and well evidenced to begin with?\n\nIf people questioning your faith leads you to passive aggressive insults and strawmen, how convinced are you really?\n\nI don't need to insult evolution deniers or skeptics to explain the theory, provide evidence and answer questions.\n\nI don't need to assume the worst intentions about that person because their doubt and lack of belief does not threaten me.\n\nYou will never respond because you got demolished here.",
