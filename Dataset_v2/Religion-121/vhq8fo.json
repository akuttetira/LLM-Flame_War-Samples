    "post_text ": "Makes no sense, really.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm going to guess you go to Paradise as the person you are, i.e. you and your consciousness, which is a product of all your memories and the emotions thus attached.  Anything else would make no sense, because if you do not have your memories then you are not you, and it is therefore not you that goes to hell, but some wholly other person. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, inevitably, many people will go to Paradise knowing their loved ones are wailing and screaming in agony, being tortured to an impossibly imaginable degree, for all eternity. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut you'll be in heaven all \"Yeah, it's cool man. I'm chilling here in the clouds with this angel playing harp for me. For all eternity. Plus, I got 72 virgins so all my loved ones being tortured doesn't matter.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNevermind being in heaven for all eternity is not something I'd ever want. Sounds absolutely terrible, really. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's ridiculous. It is so palpably and obviously man-made, the idea of heaven and being rewarded with sex and alcohol... These days, I honestly get thoroughly perplexed and baffled when I stop and realize that people ACTUALLY believe this obvious myth (The Qur'an) crafted by a potentially insane con-man (Muhammad) 1400 years ago that has zero evidence or proof to support it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just can't fathom it. It's beyond perplexing when you really stop to think about it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut one thing I'm certain of, you cannot enjoy heaven knowing your loved ones are being tortured.",

Also he condemned them for creating hell on earth for others so their agony is justified. Plus his threat of hell was just angry hyperbole. It was allegorical, as is obvious from the context.\n\nPlus their weeping and gnashing is only because they're stuck with other assholes. They have only themselves to blame.\n\nIf I am invited to paradise I will gladly go and then try to help other people get in. If they cruelly and persistently reject my help then I honestly won't feel too bad.",

It ceases to be a good measure of distaste.\n\nI mean, you are talking about humanity as an *entire species* being deserving of hell. Seriously, if you believe hell is eternal pain, you have the least compassion of anyone I have ever talked to.",

Lots of Christians believe in that hell so it's not a crazy assumption, even though I didn't assume. It's cool though, I misread comments and reply to what I thought they said more than I'd like to...\n\nIf you don't mind me asking, what is your conception of hell then?",
