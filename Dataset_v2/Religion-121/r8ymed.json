    "post_text ": "The Bible is not pro-life in the slightest. I will use multiple Bible passages to explain why the Bible shows complete disregard for the unborn and children’s lives. \n\nTo start off the Bible claims that all life starts at first breath. Genesis 2:7 states “Then the Lord God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being”. New born babies don’t breath air and sow it follows that they aren’t actually alive before birth according to the Bible.\n\nThe Bible then goes on to state that unborn babies lives are not equal to human life based on the punishment of the civil offense. “When men strive together, and hurt a woman with child, so that there is a miscarriage, and yet no harm follows, the one who hurt her shall be fined, according as the woman’s husband shall lay upon; and he shall pay as the judges determine.  If any harm follows, then you shall give life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth…“–Exodus 21:22-24”\n\nGod makes women miscarry multiple times in the Bible. In Hosea 9:11-16 Hosea prays for God’s intervention.  “Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer.  Give them, 0 Lord: what wilt thou give?  Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. . .Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb.” Clearly Hosea desires that the people of Ephraim can no longer have children.  God of course obeys by making all their unborn children miscarry. \n\n“God” again shows complete disregard for human life when he kills David’s innocent newborn son for the sins of his father (2 Samuel 12:14-31).\n\nThere are dozens of other passages where God directly kills children or commands their death. He commands child sacrifice with Abraham and Isaac and kills all of the innocent firstborn boys in Egypt. God is not “pro-life”, in fact he is quite the opposite.",

There is zero chance those reading the Bible for 3,000 years before the 20th century interpreted “breathing” as anything but independent post-birth respiration and you know that. Your argument is so contrived and insincere it should embarrass you.\n\nPlus as the example from Exodus 21:22-24 made clear above, a fetus miscarried as the result of men fighting is NOT treated as murder and resolved by a fine, which makes it plain a fetus was NOT considered a person to Biblical authors, but a kind of property with limited value. But had a child been born and breathed air, then killed, the assailant would be penalized for murder.\n\nPlease have the decency to not make up (or rehash someone else’s) absurd excuses about “cells breathing.” That’s not just weak, it’s cringy.",

What matters is what God meant by it.\n\n>Plus as the example from Exodus 21:22-24 made clear above, a fetus miscarried as the result of men fighting is NOT treated as murder and resolved by a fine, which makes it plain a fetus was NOT considered a person to Biblical authors, but a kind of property with limited value. But had a child been born and breathed air, then killed, the assailant would be penalized for murder.\n\nWhat are you talking about? Did you even read the passage?\n\n\"22 “When men strive together and hit a pregnant woman, so that her children come out, but there is no harm, the one who hit her shall surely be fined, as the woman's husband shall impose on him, and he shall pay as the judges determine. 23 But if there is harm, then you shall pay life for life, 24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 25 burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.\" - Exodus 21:22-25\n\nVerse 22 says that if the child comes out, but there is no harm, *then* there shall be a fine. *But if there is harm*, then they shall pay eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, *life for a life*. If there was harm and the child died, then they would pay *with their life*.\n\n>Please have the decency to not make up (or rehash someone else’s) absurd excuses about “cells breathing.” That’s not just weak, it’s cringy.\n\nThen the OP shouldn't make silly arguments suggesting that Babies aren't 'breathing' therefore they aren't alive according to the Bible. I was only using their own logic.",

Nowhere in the Bible does it say that babies don’t breath.\n\nShow me anywhere in this conversation that someone other than you said that babies don't breath. I got so caught up in your mischaracterization, that I missed the part where you're making the argument that babies don't breath.\n\nThe idea is that unborn babies don't breath. And before you get into the actual science of unborn babies getting oxygenated blood from the mother, the argument here is about breathing specifically, not absorbing oxygen from blood. The op quoted a bible passage about your god saying babies breath after being born.",
