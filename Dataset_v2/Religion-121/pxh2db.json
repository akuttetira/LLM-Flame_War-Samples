    "post_text ": "If Jesus was God, as is claimed by a majority of christian denominations then his sacrifice meant nothing and was more a piece of theatre than practical. WHY sacrifice your son in such an horrific way? \n\n\nIt has been said that God killed himself  to save us , from himself.  But I argue that is more akin to the worlds wildest episode of undercover boss.\n\nIf you are rich, but get to be poor for a month, you are still rich and have no worries at the end of your trial as a poor man. \n\nI argue that if Christ, being God, was aware of his divinity then he knew without a doubt that his final destination was an eternity in Heaven. Then his sacrifice, whilst painful painful the short term, wasn't that big of a price to pay as he knew the outcome would be positive for himself in the long term whereas we still have a chance of damnation. \n\nHere is my reasoning. When you know such a place is where you are going , rather than just hope that what you have believed is true, you are immune to the fear that accompanies the act of dying in non divine beings. \n\nNo offence meant, just trying to spark up a debate as to why I am wrong. Thanks to all who contribute.",

Since God knows temptations of sin will be in our lap & that we are human & not perfect, he is merciful for he is a loving and forgiving god. I feel like God tests your faith in him in many situations in life.. although he knows the outcome. For God is also a God of Law and Righteousness, he also punishes.",

While these two passages are referring specifically to the kings of Babylon and Tyre, they also reference the spiritual power behind those kings, namely, Satan. These passages describe why Satan fell, but they do not specifically say when the fall occurred. What we do know is this: the angels were created before the earth (Job 38:4-7). Satan fell before he tempted Adam and Eve in the Garden (Genesis 3:1-14). Satan’s fall, therefore, must have occurred somewhere after the time the angels were created and before he tempted Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Whether Satan’s fall occurred hours, days, or years before he tempted Adam and Eve in the Garden, Scripture does not specifically say.",

We have no reason to believe the passages are meant for anything other than the people they are aimed at. Wishful thinking and connecting patterns that are not there.\n\n>Satan fell before he tempted Adam and Eve in the Garden (Genesis 3:1-14).\n\nThe tempter in the Garden has always been referred to as a talking snake. The craftiest of God's creatures. The only connection has been when he is referred to as the old serpent in Revelations. The two are not connected any other way and the Jews, which included Jesus,  would have believed it to have been a snake. Which is why the snake was cursed to slither on its belly.",

Bro, make a logical statement that's good enough.\n\n\nAnd think logically, why 8s God the only judgement that matters? Why pretend there's another being on whom you're contingent on? You have no proof of supernatural being and yet you pretend to know that being. You can play pretend all you want, you want your cake and you wanna eat it too, that's the issue here.\n\n\"Sorry for whatever causes that\" yea, you're illogical statements do.",

This if and but game is an absolute nonsense given your religion is the one granting your god unlimited power, how he does it is absolutely of no interest to me.\nIf sin exists now, your god is either a deceitful saleman and weak and unable to do it, hence this Jesus cover-up or maybe, just maybe, \"God and sin\" don't exist conceptually.\nIf sin doesn't exist the entire story should end by saying, \"Now we have no sin\"\n\nYou can't have it both ways.",

All I gotta say is Jesus Christ fasho is a real person (A human, free will equipped). If the many motherfuckers of the Roman Empire, who’s uhh idk LIVING IN the time of Jesus.. were Questioning/Defying/Mocking/Torturing /etc. . After all the Gospel spread, many Miracles performed and even discarded all Temptation of SIN itself [against Satan himself & proved evil to be Inferior]. You on this app doing allat Hoo’Blah to my Lord doesn’t mean shit!! 😂😂 take it up with God and see for ya damn self KID 🤷‍♂️ or Dm for any Specific questions.. Honestly",

Obviously you've created him in your image so why not.\n4) Show me where in your Gospels is the Satan's whole story of bringing sin mentioned?\n5) You have never studied history for sure especially the history of your scriptures if you don't understand Satan is not even your Christian construct, it's a earlier version of pagan and Roman myth just used to make association of us vs them.\n6) Show me your God and I'll gladly take it up with him but until then his followers should be either responsible or shut up.",
