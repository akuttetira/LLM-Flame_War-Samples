    "post_text ": "If the Bible is true, we should expect the world to be full of [magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(supernatural)). The Bible presents magic and the acts of spirits and gods as real occurrences that should be detectable. I’ll ignore that miraculous events should be happening regularly.  \n\n&nbsp;  \nWe’ll start with [Exodus 7:10-13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+7%3A10-13&version=ESV), where Egyptian magicians turn staffs into snakes by secret arts. They also turn water into blood in [Exodus 7:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+7%3A20-22&version=ESV) and raise frogs from the land in [Exodus 8:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+8%3A5-7&version=ESV).    \n\nThis suggests that even prior to Moses, Egypt had been studying the art of sorcery. They had experts and could even select from among the best in the field. These experts could literally turn wood into living animals, creating life. If the Egyptians were independently able to discover such magic, it should be discoverable by any.  \n\n&nbsp;  \n[Exodus 22:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+22%3A18&version=ESV) says to kill witches/sorceresses. This would be a silly thing to command if they are not real.  \n[Leviticus 20:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+20%3A27&version=ESV) says to kill female mediums and necromancers. I'm not certain what necromancy entails, but again this implies these sorceresses are real. Women are somehow interacting with the dead.  \n\n \n&nbsp;  \nIn [2 Kings 3:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+kings+3%3A15-27&version=ESV), the king of Moab sacrifices his firstborn son to Chemosh, God of Moab. As a result, a divine wrath falls upon Israel. This defeats Yahweh and his armies and overcomes Yahweh's prophecy. This understanding of events was actually shared by the Moabites and recorded in the [Mesha Stele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesha_Stele). Sacrifice holds sway over events and gods.  \n\n\n&nbsp;  \n[1 Samuel 28:5-19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Samuel+28%3A5-19&version=ESV): Saul gets a witch to summon the deceased Samuel's ghost in a seance. He has to convince her God won't punish her first. It works. Samuel appears, and he knows God's will and the future. Witchcraft is real and powerful.  \n\n&nbsp;  \nThere are prohibitions against and mentions of practicing magic (divination, necromancy, sorcery, charms) in [Leviticus 19:26-31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=+Leviticus+19%3A26-31&version=ESV), [Leviticus 20:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=leviticus+20%3A6&version=ESV), [Deuteronomy 18:10-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+18%3A10-12&version=ESV), [1 Samuel 15:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Samuel+15%3A23&version=ESV), [2 Kings 17:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Kings+17%3A17&version=ESV), and [Isaiah 8:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isaiah+8%3A19&version=ESV). These seem to be acknowledgments of their reality.  \n\n&nbsp;  \nAnd much later, [Acts 16:16-24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+16%3A16-24&version=ESV) tells of a slave girl possessed by a spirit that can make money telling the future.   \n\nIt sounds like a typical fortune teller, scamming people for profit, but the Bible treats this as a real, magical event. They exorcise the spirit and people are very upset at her loss of ability. They imprison the exorcists. It seems expected from this that some of the fortune tellers alive today would have genuine power.  \n\n&nbsp;  \nAnd [Mark 5:1-17, Luke 8:26-39](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+5%3A1-17%2C+Luke+8%3A26-39&version=ESV) says that human beings can become possessed by demons who speak through their mouths. These demons can give humans superpower strength, so that they can break through any chains. They are also capable of inhabiting animals. They can make a creature kill itself directly and immediately. This is a terrifying threat to humanity that we somehow see very little of 2,000 years later, or elsewhere in history.  \n\n&nbsp;  \nBut [1 Timothy 4:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+4%3A1&version=ESV) declares by the Holy Spirit that demonic activity would actually increase as time went on. And according to [Matthew 8:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+8%3A16&version=ESV), they were very common back then.    \n\n&nbsp;  \n[Acts 8:9-24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+8%3A9-24&version=ESV): A non-Christian magician, Simon, had impressed (with magic) all of Samaria into following him religiously. This suggests that even at the time of Jesus, magic was prevalent outside of Yahweh's magic. Jesus was not the only miracle worker in town. No reason is ever given for this kind of magic ceasing.  \n\nSimon converts to Christianity and sees the Holy Spirit passed from person to person by physical touch. He offers to buy the power off the apostles. To me, this suggests that Simon recognized their magic as a kind that can be taught (like his tricks, presumably), but the disciples scare him off.  \n\n&nbsp;  \n&nbsp;  \nWhich leads to the next point, that there should be Yahweh magic surrounding Christians too. [James 5:14-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+5%3A14-18&version=ESV) clearly says that if anyone is sick, they should call the church elders to pray over him and anoint him with oil. If they do, he will be raised up from illness and forgiven of sins. [17-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+5%3A14-18&version=ESV) goes on to say that praying for physical things like rain can be effective.  \n\n&nbsp;  \nMany verses ensure that God will magically grant requests, [1 John 5:14-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+5%3A14-15&version=ESV), [James 4:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+4%3A3&version=ESV), [John 15:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+15%3A7&version=ESV), [15:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+15%3A16&version=ESV), [Matthew 21:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+21%3A21&version=ESV), [Matthew 7:7-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+7%3A7-8&version=ESV), [Mark 11:24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark+11%3A24&version=ESV), [John 14:13-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+14%3A13-14&version=ESV), [1 John 3:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+john+3%3A22&version=ESV).  \n\n&nbsp;  \nIn [Mark 16:16-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark+16%3A16-18&version=ESV), Jesus himself delivers a parting message: signs will accompany those who believe in him, like laying hands on the sick and healing them, drinking deadly poison and being unharmed, and casting out demons.  \nThese expectations are mostly absent from Christianity today.  \n\n&nbsp;  \nPaul talks about spiritual gifts as though they could produce real magic. [Romans 12:6-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+12%3A3-8&version=ESV) includes prophecy in the common gifts of the church members, alongside generosity and teaching.  \n\n&nbsp;  \n[1 Corinthians 12:1-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+12%3A1-11&version=ESV) says that the Holy Spirit will empower people to heal, prophecy, do miracles, speak and understand foreign languages, and discern between spirits. He says all of these are empowered by the same Holy Spirit.  \n\n&nbsp;  \n[1 Corinthians 14:4-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+14%3A4-6&version=ESV) says that those who can do prophecy are greater than those who speak in tongues unless someone is there who can interpret the person speaking in tongues. He says the church may be built up on prophecy and asks what value a gift even has if it isn't backed by prophecy or revelation. This obviously sets an expectation of prophecy.  \n\n&nbsp;  \nIn [John 16:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+16%3A13&version=ESV) Jesus says the Spirit will tell people the future.  \n\n&nbsp;  \n[Acts 1:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+1%3A8&version=ESV) says this spirit will persist until the end of the Earth.  \n\n&nbsp;  \nThen there is the continuous way in which Yahweh magically intervenes to kill people and to prove himself.  \n\n&nbsp;  \nAll of this describes a world full of magic, spirits, and gods. We should expect history to be full of evidences of magic, and we should expect magic to be persistent today. We should especially expect Christians to be able to perform magic.  \n\nBut the world we observe is not that world. It isn’t full of magic except where unverified or discredited. Christians don't summon miracles. So why the disparity?  \n\n&nbsp;  \n(Reposted to r/DebateAChristian: [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/nv49mw/the_bible_describes_a_world_of_magic/).)",

            "Reply_Text": "I'm not going to bother addressing every verse you brought up since most of it is just shotgun argumentation, but one thing did stick out, namely the summary that you put at the top of your post:\n\n>\nThe Bible presents magic and the acts of spirits and gods as real occurrences that should be detectable. I’ll ignore that miraculous events should be happening regularly.\n\nFirst and foremost these \"magical occurrences\" were not only detectable, but were recorded as history by people who claimed to witness them. People saw this stuff happen, and then wrote about it. The fact that they don't happen very much today (if at all) doesn't mean that they haven't ever happened before.\n\nThis is a common mistake that atheists make in a lot of their rhetoric, where they try to claim that just because something is statistically unlikely or hasn't happened in a long time, that must mean it's actually impossible for it to happen. It's pretty absurd, considering that unlikely events occur literally all of the time, such as your birth (as opposed to the millions of other sperm-cells that could have fertilized the egg that you came from), or the existence of a planet like Earth which has been so fine-tuned for life that it's probably alone in the Universe in that regard.\n\nThat leads me to the next thing. When you say things like \"miracles should be happening regularly\" it speaks volumes of what you actually know about the subject and how these terms are defined. A \"miracle\" (or magical occurrence, as you like to call it) is a departure from the laws of nature, or what is perceived to be \"normal\"; acted out by God for the purpose of displaying His power and authenticating the messages He gives to His prophets. Whenever a miracle is performed in the Bible it is always, without exception, to let everyone know that the miracle-worker came straight from God. Every single time. Because God's word is complete, and because we now have full access to everything God wants us to know in the Bible, there's no reason for God to perform miracles anymore.\n\nAlso like I said, miracles aren't *supposed* to be a common thing. The whole point to miracles is that they are rare, and in fact so rare that they basically never happen, meaning that when one does occur it must mean something special. If people were being brought back from the dead all the time, then Jesus' resurrection wouldn't mean anything. We're able to distinguish it as a miracle because it has never happened before.",

And we know there are people who convincingly *pretend* to tell the future, heal people, transform objects, etc (palm readers, faith healers, stage magicians).",

There isn't a single new atheist out there who would really be convinced by the kind of proof that you're calling into question right now. There are people out there, especially ones of the sort of stripe I assume you are from, who could watch a miracle transpire right before their eyes and still find ways to dismiss it. I've talked with people who have said that they would probably assume that they were hallucinating if they saw something miraculous, and then turn around and demand even more proof from God. And when I entertain that idea and ask what further evidence they could want, it's always something completely ridiculous like \"He should sign every atom he used \" or \"He should do some celestial lightshows over my house and throw write \"I am GOD. I exist!\" on the moon\". And even that wouldn't fully persuade most of them.\n\nI don't want to make assumptions about you, but something tells me that you're no different than the rest of the hardcore atheists I've talked to. There's a point where you get so entrenched in what you believe (or don't believe I guess) that you quite literally cannot be reasoned with - no matter how much God reveals Himself to you or what He does to try to open your mind. The problem isn't that there's no proof, it's that even if it was sitting right in front of your face you would still keep denying it till the cows came home. That's a kind of spiritual blindness that an online debate just isn't going to fix.\n\nIf you can show that you are honestly considering these questions and aren't just karma-whoring to the pathetic excuse for an echo-chamber that this subreddit is, then we can carry this further. If not, then it'll have to be cut short.",

A miracle that proves a god would be someone like Jesus claiming to be god, and showing himself turning water into wine or walking on water before our eyes.  The fact that these types of specific miracles only happen in the specific religions holy text is suspicious to its credibility.\n\nWhy can’t god appear before my eyes in his own form (or a form that I could understand) and claim that he was the god who exists.  He is omnipotent, so he should be able to do so.  Is the human soul not worth his infinite time? Would he rather us be subject to his twisted test?  Why do Christians claim “you can’t test god”?  Who made that rule?  Sounds like it came about with Christianity as a way to dismiss the fact that we have 0 verifiable proof of the supernatural in regards to Christianity.",

So why the disparity?\n\nThere are 83 miracles that are specified in the Old Testament, the Old Testament occurs over a period of 3600 years (from about 4000BC to 400BC). So we can conclude that miracles ought to happen around every 43 years or so based on that number. However, there are also 80 something miracles in the New Testament which takes place only over a period of a hundred years. Which would mean that miracles do not follow any predictable law and thus we cannot determine whether miracles exist based on whether they are occurring in any particular timeframe or not. Perhaps we have no major miracles for a couple hundred years and then in 2122 they just crop up all the time, we have no idea because there is no predictive power in regards to miracles.\n\nMy argument is that miracles can never be empirically verified because they do not conform to natural laws and empirical science is weak in that it can only investigate natural laws.",

It was a religious ritual, not a medical procedure. There is no equivalence between church elders and physicians.\n\n>Exodus 22:18 does confirm that witches existed but is neutral on whether they actually held supernatural powers or whether they were just charlatans no different than psychics are to this day.\n\nNot all the authors are neutral on this. In 1 Samuel 28, a witch actually summons a ghost which can predict the future and discern God’s will. The girl in Acts 16 appears to really be able to tell the future.\n\nThe wording of the prohibitions against magic in the OT are definitely consistent with treating magic as real, and would be a bit odd if the authors didn’t think so.\n\n>They are what do you think all of these records collected into the Bible are? What do you think all these claims of miracles to this very day are, if not observations of some phenomena occurring?\n\nI think they are just claims. They are all unverifiable, discredited, or explicable without appeal to the supernatural. They tend to hide from observation or confirmation, especially by skeptics.",

Just because a prophet believes that witchcraft can hold power, doesn't mean that witches hold any power in actuality. Nor are all things in the Bible necessarily accurate depictions of what happened. The belief in fortune telling ghosts is not required for the core Christian beliefs so such passages can easily be dismissed as a creation or misunderstanding of the author.\n\n>I think they are just claims.\n\nSo they are observable, even if such observations may be misguided or outright wrong then yes?",

In a non-deistic world view.\n\n>Are you suggesting that every human being has witnessed magic of the sort in the post?\n\nYes. It’s a bit trickier to explain because of how you defined “magic”, however it works the same as the biblical perspective of “Light and darkness”. On one hand, you have the “good magic” produced by Yahweh to reveal himself to have a relationship *with* his creation, and on the other hand you have “bad magic” which is everything Yahweh *can* do, just without full completion or the power. One example you noted was the biblical Exodus account, where the Pharaoh’s magicians were able to make a staff into a snake, but when Moses did the *same*, ***His*** snake ate the other snakes.\n\nAnother example would be the specificity of “magical” judgments, such as the final plague on Egypt was the  death of the first born sons - just as Pharaoh had done to the Israelites.",

Doing something in the scale of the universe would require a incredibly more of a vastly intelligent being. I -*personally* - believe that science and Christianity co-exist, as science is based on the repeatability of tests. It’s a form of knowledge that describes the world we see and live. I believe you can only claim “God of the gaps” if the Bible said that creation wasn’t specific in design, and that’s not the case.",

I honestly feel bad for you if you honestly believe magic is real. Every example you’ve given so far does not prove magic. There’s no such things as demons,magic or god. You have to prove all those things without the use of the Bible. Also supernatural always turns out to be natural when investigated.",

You won’t understand it unless you are consistent in the worldview of *at least* a higher being.\n\nAs for cameras and recording, not really, no. God doesn’t work on the command of humans. It’s the other way around. Every miracle Yahweh has ever done has been for His own sake and fulfillment of His Will. A miracle is Gods evidence of existence, if you don’t believe in a God, you won’t understand the explanation.\n\nAs for the “supernatural always returning to the natural”: duh. You forget that the Bible is written by *human perspective*. Just because it doesn’t look natural at face value doesn’t mean it’s not being done by things in the earth. How else do you expect a god that claims to bring calamity? He works through the natural world to give evidence there is something above what we can see.\n\nFor example, if you take the biblical account of the Exodus, and you see how the pharaoh at the time killed first born sons. Through Egyptian history, thee is only a single account that can possibly match this, however it’s dated to about 100 years in the future from the exodus account.\n\nWho’s to say this is - in fact - the same time period and *humans* got it wrong? There’s more than enough information about the Pharaoh Ahmose and his firstborn son who died at a young age to draw a conclusion of how the events of the plagues happen.",
