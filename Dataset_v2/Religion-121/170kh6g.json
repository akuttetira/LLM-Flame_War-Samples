    "post_text ": "Being gay is not something you can choose to be. It is a part of a person’s personality and overall life, and is not something you can force yourself to not be. Why would god create all of these people when he knew that they were going to be like this, and that they had no choice?\n\nGay people are not attracted to people of the opposite sex. This means that god expects them to either live a life of misery in which they cannot be with someone they truly love, or live a life of sin where they *can* be happy and their true selves.",

Even eye color has multiple genes that influence it.\n\nYour biological sex is due to a complex interaction with no less than three genes on multiple chromosomes.  And that is ignoring the gene pathways for the hormone receptors that take the output of those genes and influence the sexual development.  Certain configurations of the first series of genes could produce hormones to signal the body to develop male typical anatomy even if no Y chromosome is present.  Certain configurations of the second pathway might prevent the reception of those hormones leading the body to produce female typical anatomy anyway.\n\nThere's no 'male' or 'female' gene either.  You could point to the Y chromosome and say there is a 'male' chromosome, but there are and have been people with XY chromosomes who nevertheless develop a uterus and ovaries and are able to get pregnant and give birth to offspring and in every way appear to be female. In the same way there have been and are XX chromosome males with functioning testes that are capable of producing viable sperm.\n\nThere's no gay gene, because that's not how genetics works.  That doesn't change the fact that sexual orientation is at least in part genetic.",

What this does, especially when a big brother, a father, are meant to protect, it pushed her away from all males. All men were unsafe, so as she developed further, reaching the age of wanting companionship, solace was found in the same sex. Ironically, Kimmy developed a romantic interest in me. Because trust was established. That's one example, I have hundreds, there's never been an exception. You, on the other hand have knowledge of facts nir experience to base assumptions on.
