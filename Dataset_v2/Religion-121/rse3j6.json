If someone says “have sex with me or I’ll shoot your brains out” it’s not really free will, and if they would rather die it’s the killer/rapists fault for putting them in that situation.\n\nWhy is it different with god? “God gave us free will it’s up to us to choose” but if we choose not to worship him we go to hell. How is that really free will? True free will is doing as you please and not given ultimatums.",

If God were a good God who wanted us fo worship him, he would have made us all into mindless robots only capable of doing the right thing everyday. Fortunately for us, a good god is literally an oxymoron, especially considering the state of the world right now.",

You vividly described the details of hell so well that readers can imagine it, whilst curtly mentioning heaven. Despite your attempt to portray hell, you still failed. Read up on Islamic hell. .\nAnd also that isn't really an argument more of an attempt for me to sympathise with your point of view.\nSo for the test.\nThe being who owns everything, even your body and soul asks you to forgo your desires for a brief period of time and worship him. In return, you will be purified and blessed with whatever you wanted for eternity. But  failure, to do so leads to your inaccurate description. And yet you focus on the punishment.  Do you realise how weird you are?\nIn your reply, do make an actual point as to why God is \"manipulatively evil\" ?",

And I don’t recall anyone asking me anything in my life, just humans feeding me some bullshit books they decided are worthy enough to worship. You probably geographically were born in a region where Islam is prominent, I grew up in the Christian church. If what you’re saying is true, then I make a declaration now: The prophet Mohammad is a child rapist, misogynistic asshole and the Quran is fiction. If your God is real, I expect my life to get a lot worse right?? I’ll check back in with you in a few months ☺️. All religions are man made fictions designed to control the masses, definitely NOT worthy of me living my entire life for. God doesn’t exist so therefore when you die you’re just gone, just like before you were born, you just cease to exist and that’s it. There is no “owner” of everything 😂😂😂, that’s just idiotic man 😬😅.",

Free will is the One creator giving us the choice to choose between right and wrong as opposed to being forced to do right or wrong then be unfairly rewarded/punished for it. Its not a game, there is infinite wisdom in the creation of mankind. We don't decide what the almighty should have or shouldn't have done though, that's not really our place, since we're not creators of the universe and all. We don't have any control over the Almighty's will, He created us with free will and we should be grateful fir that.",
