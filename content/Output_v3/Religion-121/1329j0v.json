  "judgement": "The argument that the cultural and biological differences between 7th century Arabia and modern times justify the marriage of a 9-year-old girl to a 53-year-old man is more defensible than the blanket dismissal of the historical context and the Hadiths as irrelevant or dishonest.",
  "steering": "Let's focus on the fact that a 9-year-old child was married to a 53-year-old man, regardless of the cultural context. This is a serious issue that transcends historical or religious differences. Can we please discuss this without resorting to personal attacks or gaslighting?"
