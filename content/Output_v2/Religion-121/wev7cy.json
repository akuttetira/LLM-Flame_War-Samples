You know what it means for an idea to be fatally flawed.\\n\\nI'm not being obtuse, I'm being honest. You're the one who's being evasive. You're saying that Judaism is not genocidal, but you're not explaining why. You're saying that the Torah is not genocidal, but you're not explaining why. You're saying that Judaism is not fatally flawed, but you're not explaining why. You're not giving any clear reasons why Judaism is not genocidal, and you're not giving any clear reasons why the Torah is not genocidal. You're just saying that it's not, and that's it.\\n\\n> I think that practically all Jewish ideology views the Torah as a text written by or connected to God, and a text to be admired and revered and upheld as a source of truth and wisdom.\\n\\nThat's a pretty weak argument. If the Torah is a text written by or connected to God, then it's a text that should be revered and upheld as a source of truth and wisdom. But if it's a text that encourages genocide, then it's not a source of truth and wisdom. It's a source of evil. And if Judaism is an ideology that views the Torah as a text to be admired and revered, then that's a problem. It's a problem because it means that Judaism is complicit in the perpetuation of evil. It's a problem because it means that Judaism is willfully ignorant of the evil that the Torah encourages. And it's a problem because it means that Judaism is actively working to perpetuate that evil.\\n\\n> What does \\\"inherently wrong thing to do - in the factual sense\\\" mean? To me what you've said here is incoherent.\\n\\nI think you're being incoherent because you're not giving any clear reasons why Judaism is not genocidal. You're not giving any clear reasons why"
