He is not saying that the world has remained the same since the beginning of time, but rather that the world has remained the same since the beginning of time, but the Lord is patient with us, waiting for us to repent. The word'since' in this context means 'from the beginning of time' not 'from the beginning of the current time period'.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"author\": \"thrww3534\",\n  },\n  {\n    \"author\": \"[deleted]\",\n  },\n  {\n    \"author\": \"[deleted]\",\n  },\n  {\n    \"author\": \"[deleted]\",\n  },\n  {\n    \"author\": \"[deleted]\",\n  },\n  {\n    \"author\": \"[deleted]\",\n  },\n  {\n    \"author\": \"[deleted]\",\n  },\n  {\n    \"author\": \"[deleted]\",\n  },\n  {\n    \"author\": \"[deleted]\",\n  },\n  {\n    \"author\": \"[deleted]\",\n  },\n  {\n    \"author\": \"[deleted]\",\n  },\n  {\n    \"author\": \"[deleted]\",\n  },\n  {\n    \"author\": \"[deleted]\",\n  },\n  {\n    \"author\": \"[deleted]\",\n  },\n  {\n    \"author\": \"[deleted]\",\n  },\n  {\n    \"author\": \"[deleted]\",\n  },\n  {\n    \"author\": \"[deleted]\",\n  },\n  {\n    \"author\": \"[deleted]\",\n  },\n  {\n    \"author\": \"[deleted]\",\n  },\n  {\n    \"author\": \"[deleted]\",\n  },\n  {\n    \"author\": \"[deleted]\",\n  },\n  {\n    \"author\": \"[deleted]\",\n  },\n  {\n    \"author\": \"[deleted]\",\n  },\n  {\n    \"author\": \"[deleted]\",\n  },\n  {\n    \"author\": \"[deleted]\",\n  },\n  {\n    \"author\": \"[deleted]\",\n  },\n  {\n    \"author\": \"[deleted]\",\n  },\n  {\n    \"author\": \"[deleted]\",\n  },\n  {\n    \"author\": \"[deleted]\",\n  },\n  {\n"
