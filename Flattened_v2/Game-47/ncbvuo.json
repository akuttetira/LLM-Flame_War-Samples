People are defending pretty much every aspect of EGS. And not in a \"I could see why that function missing would be important to you\" sort of way, but a \"That function is stupid and you're stupid for wanting it\" sort of way.\n\nSomeone asked in a thread yesterday \"Who buys 10 games at once?\" I ended up responding to that same person twice in different parts of the thread where they were asking the same thing (didn't realize it was the same person).\n\nThere's no way this level of defending EGS is organic. You'd think it was a team for some of them.\n\nEdit:\nThey're here!!!!!"

The number of times I come across a comment proclaiming Reddit/Twitter/Facebook to be ran by the alt-right or supporting the alt-right is far more often than you'll ever find an upvoted moderate or conservative post on any subreddit. So, I think it's safer to conclude that if you shovel horse sh--, you probably shovel other kinds of sh-- as well."

People bring good arguments as to why they dislike the EGS or Epic in general, and they toss them aside by saying \"nuh uh, you're just salty Steam fanboys, we don't really need user reviews/forums/etc\". Heck, I've had people tell me that Workshop and controller support are unnecessary, as you can do it through third-party software, when the whole point is exactly that, avoiding having to go through third-party software."

If you don’t think a shopping cart matters in an online store, that’s one discussion - but to suggest that the store is actually _better_ without it is fucking insane.\n\nAlso, I’ve had the same “who buys X amount of games at once” type of defense.

    "text": "Reddit now operates under the illusion that the most worthy content is upvoted by users themselves. Every mainstream sub (PublicFreakout, Politics, Pics, etc.) is used for advertising products and political propaganda. Full-stop. It honestly makes me not want to use Reddit most days, and it's helped me cut back on social media usage.\n\nThere was a guy I followed who would daily predict which posts would make it to the top of r/politics. He got banned, but for about two or three weeks straight he was able to point out which post in the morning would make it to the top of politics by 10 AM EST. There was always a pattern he explained.\n\nPeople are so quick to say \"Oh yeah Russian bots influenced the US election\", but refuse to believe that the most mainstream channels have been compromised. Like, do you think the trolls only visit niche subreddits? Reddit is basically a political and business focused ad platform now."

Highest base audience, biggest draw for people looking to sway crowds. Whether it's as simple as marketing something in comments or trying to skew the results of an election or anything else imaginable on any scale.\n\nSure one person and a week can do a lot in a small sub--but ten people and a month can do a *fucking lot* on even the largest subs. And there are *thousands* such people/bots and many have been around for literal years at this point."

You give it away for free and more people discover that it sucks. It does not make you want to voluntarily purchase products on it with money. The free products I've tried through it made me more likely to wait out the exclusivity period for games that I might have otherwise been inclined to buy on EGS just because it was bad."
