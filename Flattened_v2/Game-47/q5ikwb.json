    "text": "The Last of us 2 is good for people who have not clue what a good story is all about and what makes a good story. Everybody who loves the last of us 2 probably also likes the last jedi… Should tell you all you need to know.\n\nI grew up watching James cameron movies like aliens and T1 and T2. James cameron actually knows how to make a proper story for a sequel and not shit on every character from the first movies. They grew in his sequels. They overcome stuff they fear and you actually give a crap about every damn character in those movies because they are written how they should be and actually have strong female characters unlike the last of us 2. Yeah nice gameplay and graphics but shitty story. You gotta be less than 18 years old to love that game or just a blind fanboy who can‘t admit that his game isn‘t as great as he wanted it to be and defends it at all cost because of it."
