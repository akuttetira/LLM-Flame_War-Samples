But I also think that most people who are going to play it on a PC would rather wait for a port than buy a PS5. specially if they start seeing more games being ported.\n\nWe are already seeing the term \"Xbox exclusive\" having less value because most, if not all of them are going to end up in PC. But Microsoft is betting on selling subscriptions not consoles. If Sony keeps going that way, they might end up pulling a MS sooner or later."

They can generally take new ideas/IPs and even sell at a lose if it means more people into said ecosystem.\n\nNow if they release those games on PC. The design choice starts to fade away. Less people willing to buy say a PS5 so less PS+ Subs, less third party shares, and accessories.\n\nBottom line, it hurts the company long term. Imagine if Zelda or Mario went to PC. The Nintendo Switch would of had half its sales."

They all have very generic gameplay (the gameplay is fun, just not anything new) with PHENOMENAL stories. This argument makes no sense. Death Stranding was made for PS4 and PC and it was one of the boldest games made in years even if it wasn’t well received and it wasn’t an exclusive. If a game is well made by a big developer, it’ll sell regardless. Anything Santa Monica, Naughty Dog, and Sucker Punch make are gonna sell like crazy regardless of platform."

Even our beloved Rockstar games will mostly be GTA and RDR with the main focus being online.\n\nSony is allowed to take risks with new IPs because the main focus isn't getting people to buy the game. Its to get people to buy the console.\n\nThis is what the old CEO of Sony vision:\n\n\nStep One: Buy PS4\n\nStep Two: Buy Exclusive game\n\nStep Three: Buy PS+\n\nStep Four: Buy Third Party games\n\nStep Five: Buy PlayStation accessories\n\nThis same strategy allowed Sony to come back during the PS3 era and allowed PS4 to dominate."

But if Sony brings their games to PC, especially PS5 games which are designed from the ground up on the PS5, they would look a lot better than Halo Infinite."

Microsoft’s games are still locked on Windows OS, so they are still “exclusive” to Microsoft’s biggest platform.

Older games coming to PC after a long time should be seen as a good thing, more people playing a game is a good thing. After two years or so most people who would have played the game on console would have played it. I wouldn't be too worried about it"

Someone who cares enough about the quality to give people the experience that made all of us fans love the game as much as we do."

On top of allowing more people to play them, it also makes it easier for people to play games from past generations. I never had a PS3 or an Xbox 360, but through PC I've been able to play games from that generation.\n\nAnd while it makes sense for Sony not to port their titles to Xbox, the PC market is distinct enough from the home console market that it should increase game sales without hurting console sales that much. Many PC users like PC, and buy neither an Xbox or a PlayStation, so porting games to PC allows Sony to sell to that market, which wasn't going to buy a PlayStation anyways."
