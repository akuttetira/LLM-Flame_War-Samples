    "text": "Couldn't agree more. I do not understand why they walked away from the industrial design aesthic of the PS4 generation. They were sleek while also having a bit of a character with the slant design they were going for. When you compare how the OG PS4 had a character while the Xbox One was a boring box.\n\nThis thing is fucking big and ugly as shit."
