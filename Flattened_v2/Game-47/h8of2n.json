I loved every bit of it.\n\nInternet fandom seems to totally ruin things for themselves by setting impossibly high standards."

    "text": "Same. I hated solo and the last Jedi, but I loved rogue one and the mandalorian. I also think the force awakens isn’t bad at all. And I thought that maybe Disney wouldn’t let a multi billion dollar purchase go down the drain.\n\nBut god damn. They did not care about that movie. It was one of the worst endings to a ‘saga’ that I have ever seen that was kick out of post production."

    "text": "I don’t even blame Disney, I blame JJ more. That dude had such a hard on for retconning Last Jedi so much.\n\nI too hated last Jedi when it came out. Watched it again before ROS and honestly? I actually really like it. It did a lot of things I did not expect and I think did a good job of setting up what could’ve been a great 3rd movie.\n\nBut ya know, gotta shoehorn in on your left."

    "text": "Yeah that's a solid reasoning I think, it really does feel like they didn't care about it. How can you have a trilogy released and not have a clue what is meant to happen in the next movie?? Same thing happened with Game of Thrones, the writers didn't give a fuck."

    "text": "I don’t think disliking the Rise of Skywalker counts as having impossibly high standards, tbf. It barely holds continuity within itself, much less within the trilogy it’s a part of or Star Wars as a larger narrative.\n\nYou can like it if you want, but you’re also not some basement dwelling neckbeard because you like your movies to make sense every once and a while."

    "text": "Yep. It’s the same toxic concept as the “if I can’t have the girl then no one can” trope.\n\nIt’s so bizarre and unnecessary. Why can’t people just... agree to disagree?\n\nIt’s ok to dislike Last Of Us II. It’s also ok to love it. It’s a video game.\n\nWhy do some people look for conspiracy theories that allegedly prove that nobody enjoyed the game?\n\nWhy is that a better mindset to have than, say....I don’t know... not letting strangers’ video game opinions be that upsetting?\n\nI just don’t get it."

They just like to think their intellect is superior to everyone while proving to everyone the opposite is true."
