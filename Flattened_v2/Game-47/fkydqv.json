As for having a sad life, not really,my kids have grown up into really good people so im pretty proud of them, really happy that their happy. I wasnt mad either, just bored with the usual keyboard warrior shite from somebody who makes worthless comments. You have a good night though because after your pretty rude posts you must have had a shitty day. Oh and you didnt strike a nerve either because you dont know me. I could give you some pointers if you want to vent though. Just let me know kid ok."
