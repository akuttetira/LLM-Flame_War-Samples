    "text": "Ya realize that general media outlets and especially WSJ talk pure bullshit about him and take everything out of context just cause he called them out right?\n\nIt's clear you don't really know anything about this, the only racist thing he's ever done was saying the n word to some random online years ago as an insult. It happened literally once, out of someone who has 5 thousand videos and countless streams.\n\nYet most of the media still tries to make him the bad guy at any moment just cause they're scared of the actual influence he has, compared to some outdated publishers. He's done more charity work than everyone shitting on him tenfold, and has done it without bragging or letting his ego involved.\n\nLike if you're really hating on Felix at this point its just sad and such a shame, since he's one of the few guys out there that's still keeping it 100% real and can actually unite us."

I have road rage and have to deal with mother fuckers who don't understand the difference between red and green lights.\n\nRage doesn't change who you are, it shows who you are. Rage doesn't force you to spout racist shit, if you say racist shit while raging... You already spout racist shit.\n\nEdit: Only thing I know about pewdiepie is from a South Park episode. I can't say much about him. But don't pretend rage changes you. Rage  brings forth who you really are."

You are that person saying or doing whatever it is you're doing during your moments of rage.\n\nThat's. You.\n\nYour logic means that whenever someone abused another person out of anger, the abuser isn't at fault. Fuck that noise. Rage doesn't give you a hall pass to act however you want.\n\nDefending racism \"because rage\" is some of the cringiest and most toxic shit I've heard in a while now."

    "author": "SparklyDaCrow",
    "text": "Okay so I'm gonna jump in here. This is just wrong. Anger, and emotions in general, make people do things or think about doing things they never would have done before. Think about people with extreme sadness or depression. You're practically saying that someone who wants to kill themselves in that moment is just \"who they are.\" In summary, anger definitely doesn't change someone but it does make you consider doing or saying things that you will regret later."

    "text": "See, in your rage it shows you're not very bright.\n\nPunching a wall doesn't make you an MMA fighter, no more than punching another person does. MMA has set rules and both ppl willingly join a contest. However, punching a wall **shows that you are violent**.\n\nYour mental gymnastics just shows how cringey you are.\n\nIf you have a problem with yelling racist shit while mad, which would explain why you're so defensive about this, you have a racism problem. Figure your shit out and stop using anger as a excuse."

    "author": "SparklyDaCrow",
    "text": "Someone punching a wall has nothing to do with them being violent. I had a friend awhile back who used to punch some drywall in his basement to decompress and he always stated it really helped him. He was never a violent person, he just needed an outlet. Also, nothing about it is \"cringey.\" Would rather had him get it out like that then not at all."

  {
    "author": "Dropkickedasakid",
    "text": "Oh lord you actually took everything literally, which I guess explains your simplistic mindset a lot. I was quite obviously exaggerating things to show how ridiculous what you are trying to say is.\n\nSlamming your fist onto the desk is common as fuck but that doesn't mean everyone who does so is a violent person, I can't even imagine how dense someone that actually believes that is. Like I've punched a wall once or twice when frustrated but I can't even slap my girls ass hard enough because I'm afraid of hurting her, and I could never hurt anyone else, even if I was angry as hell.\n\nAnyway I'm even not defending racism here, I'm just saying that if someone blurts out a random bad word once in a fit of anger or frustration it doesn't show who they truly are and forever will be just because it was the worst possible word that came out. Over-exaggerating and permanently labeling people by their mistakes even when they've really apologized and more than made up for it is just so lame."
