I cannot even imagine the amount of supports and clean up required. Then add probably multiple days to print I would likely not sell one side for less than $60 if I were to print one but I cannot since the printers I have access to cannot get to 390mm. My personal cannot even get to the width of 260mm. A $10 injection molded set would be much better and look better."

Made the thickness 4mm which I believe to be adequate but I think the actual thickness is even higher on the PS5. So with 4 perfectly flat sheets with no hooks or supports I come out to $8.61 for the 336g of filament. That is over a quarter of a spool for just a flat sheet of 1 side of the PS5. https://i.imgur.com/lfHD2cx.jpg"

    "author": "sekazi",
    "text": "As I said below if you factor in the person wanting it then it would be around $94 after factoring material and time. Even more because this could only be printed vertically which takes longer. I could print for $20 but there is no chance I would sell anything below $1/hr."

I am planning on doing a lot of weird designs that will click in just right.\n\nOne of the fun ones is that can hold up the PS5 in the air. It'll be similar in shape to a Tie Fighter, the PS5 will sit comfortably on a base between the two panels.\n\nAnother fun one I have will be a panel that can hold games, controllers, headset etc.\n\nAnd the impossible one is a panel(s) that connect to other game consoles on the side. So PS5 in center, other consoles on the side. The Switch would be easy to hold. But trying to hold an Xbox Series X? Challenge accepted."
