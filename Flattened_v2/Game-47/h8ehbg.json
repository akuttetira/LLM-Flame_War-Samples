    "text": "Exactly. Many disliked the leaks so much that they’ve decided to automatically dismiss the entire game and all of the amazing reviews it’s getting. They didn’t like 2 hours that were leaked so the whole 30 hour game MUST be trash. Anyone that disagrees is deemed a Sony shill and anyone giving the game a mixed review is paraded around as being the only genuine reviewer."

    "text": "I am a huge fan of part 1. I saw the leaks and was worried, honestly. But after seeing the promo, all the amazing reviews, I also realized that Naughty Dog has never let me down. If anyone can make a sequel to one of the best games of all time, and tell another incredible story, it’s these guys. I have no reason to think they didn’t pull it off again. Haters are dumb enough to think that they decided to go “woke” and sacrifice everything about the first game that was so loved - why tf would a game 7 years in development by one of the best studios in the industry not be an amazing one??"

    "text": "It’s like they need an excuse to hate the game and say it’s trash. The only way to do that is to handpick the 3 mixed reviews and completely ignore the general consensus that it’s a 9/10+ game. It’s crazy how the ppl saying it’s amazing have played the game whilst the ppl saying it sucks haven’t even played it. It’s pretty clear who’s opinion to trust in this case."

    "author": "Hidan213",
    "text": "It’s funny how the three mixed reviews the haters are latching on to aren’t even outright bad (like they aren’t saying the game is an utter failure and trash,  and to not touch this game with a 10ft stick), and instead they mostly say they were personally disappointed with the story and gameplay.\n\nYeah, not everyone is going to enjoy this game, not every game is for everyone. But there’s no review that says to avoid it like it’s the plague."
  },
  {
    "author": "MS211200",
    "text": "I mean every game has mixed reviews. Even the original one. The point is that there is a prevailing narrative that says that part 1 is a masterpiece and a 10/10. You can’t just ignore most of the stellar reviews if you didn’t like the game, but that’s what these ppl seem to be doing w TLOU2. Another thing is that these ppl haven’t even played the game but have already decided to hate it because of the leaks - they don’t have a valid reason to hate it but reviewers that give it a 9/10+ have a valid to reason to love it because they’ve played the whole thing"

    "text": "When all the leaks first started circling, an overly-opinionated, undereducated, headline-worshipping friend of mine went on an absolute tirade on FB about how ND ruined his favorite game as if they were supposed to make for him personally.\n\nNot long after that, I got rid of FB. Earlier today, my friend messaged me: “Good thing you don’t have FB anymore.” to which I replied: “What did he do this time?” and he laughed because I already knew. Yep. He was up in arms about it all over again.\n\nIt’s absolutely infuriating."
