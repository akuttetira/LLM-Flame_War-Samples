    "text": "I would say that the chance of success increase by a lot for every year you continue working on your project. I don’t think there are many games at all where a one man dev has spent over 10 000 hours working on it and isn’t earning anything. Usually they would give up much earlier because they realize they can’t or don’t want to make it.\n\nGame development is one of the industries that if you actually have somewhat of an understanding of what the market wants to play and you have a strong enough desire to create a game for over 10 000 hours, it’s not really unrealistic to earn money on it. Other industries like music, streaming and books are definitely harder to break through even with 10 000 hours. I do expect it to become increasingly difficult to find success with video games though because the barrier to entry is bound to become lower with more tools, templates and AI. But at the moment, I wouldn’t say that there are decade spanning projects being released and failing daily. And if you have done some kind of planning for your project you should be able to be adjusted to fill some other kind of need from the market as a back up-plan. Also these 10 000 hours should be spent taking advantage of the tools that make it easier for you to make games. Making your own game engine can definitely take over 10 000 hours and will make it much harder to get a return on investment. I also think working in 2D is very limiting as well. Following all these things should definitely make it very likely for a developer to be able to generate money.\n\nBut yeah, the safest route would be to work part-time until you’ve generated an income/fanbase. This post got a bit long and don’t know if you have any interest in it. I agree with the sentiment to not take game dev too lightly, but at the same time it’s the only part of the ”entertainment industry” I think people could actually realistically get a return on time invested because of the steep barrier to entry combined with how iterative game development is.\n\nGovernments also create barriers to entry like health care in America. Sweden (where I’m from) has a very big game development scene partly because the consequences of going bankrupt in Sweden are not as big as in America. Okay, sorry for the rant, have a good day. :)"

I did most of the game itself while they did all the ancillary stuff and the reports. That shit still took forever, and it was a simple barebones clone of an existing game with slight differences. So yeah, game dev is fucking hard, draining and it better be a fucking passion for you if you want real success."

    "text": "This is kind of a stupid quote. Though, going though the real calculations, not the divide by 20, it's still true, I guess.\n\nI really hope these guys look at personal finance and r/fire stuff.\n\nThe article says 6 mil after taxes split between the brothers and other people. So say each brother gets 2.5mil, put 1 mil towards everyone else. Put that into total stock index funds like a normal retiree, and you've instantly retired early. No need to work for income any more in their lives. Can continue working on dwarf fortress as a passion, or not, or just do whatever they want.\n\n2.5mil times a four percent withdrawal rate is a $100k per year. Maybe a bit less if you want to fully guarantee beyond all odds of never going bust -- though usually it's 4% as the safe withdrawal rate. So not 20 years, but fully until they die, and passing on probably grown inheritance to their kids (assuming they have kids).\n\nAnd that's probably all in taxable, not in any tax free retirement account. So you're going to have the super nice long term gains on that, not normal taxes. And it wouldn't be for the 100k you're pulling out, but the difference, i.e. the gain. If they're both married, they're paying absolute jack shit in taxes.\n\nWhich means they're probably eligible for Medicaid, and getting super nice medical insurance.\n\nI wish these guys the best. It would be such a waste to squander this life changing amount of money -- and I like it when people change their life to gain max freedom instead of wasting it all.\n\nAnd I'm sure people are gonna come out of the woodwork to these guys, knowing they have money.\n\nThe article says they're buying a nicer house, which is great. After this, you shouldn't still be living like you're fully poor. But it does say boats at the bottom... So I really hope that even if they do take it nice, they still manage to hold on to most of it.\n\nSudden windfalls are always scary to read about. Especially such public ones."
