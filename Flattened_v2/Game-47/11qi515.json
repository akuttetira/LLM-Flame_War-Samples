Halo 3 and MW2 were absolute cesspools that would have been locked down so quick in today's gaming era.\n\nThose fuckers NEVER got banned either unless they were sending porn. So fuckin wild lmao."

    "text": "In Halo 3, I loved to whack my teammates until they got mad enough to kill me. Then if I got the boot message, I would leave it on my screen and keep trash talking. There was a trick to keep walking around with the boot message up, so they would never guess I had the ability to boot them from the game at any moment. Then at the perfect moment, when the trash talk lined up just right, I would boot them. Then await the message from them. Bonus if it was voice message. I miss this so much."

Dude was SO MAD and spewing all kinds of racist shit. lol.\n\nWe in the party chat clowning this cat. man, those days was something else bruh, lol"
