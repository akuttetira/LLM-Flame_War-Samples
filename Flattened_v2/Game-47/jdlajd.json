If you don't like it, throw out your console.\n\nIf it means that much, if it's a principle of yours then you must be quite fickle to just shrug it off.\n\n\"I don't like when people do this it's wrong!... but I'll go along with it anyway...\" is not a respectable stance. So when you take it don't expect people to take you seriously."

Because deep down he doesn't really care. He's just bumping his gums and regurgitating rhetoric he's consumed from weird discord groups and shitty alt right gamers on twitch and YouTube and twitter etc etc.\n\nI'm saying he doesn't _really_ care that much. So he shouldn't be pretending that he does."

It’s just weird."
