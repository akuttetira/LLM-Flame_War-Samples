    "text": "Apart from being cool looking... I think that ONE of the reasons Sony put all those little embossed shape symbols on both the PS5 faceplates, and on the DS controller, was in order to help differentiate legit Sony Made panels and controllers vs fakes/knock off's. Personally I think this was a smart move by Sony, as I doubt most fake/knock off makers are going to invest in producing molds which have the same level of detail."

    "author": "SwissPatriotRG",

It's much more likely that they'd buy a cheap injection mold to go with the other cheap components.  Case in point, every time I've seen a counterfeit product the injection molding is always sub par compared to the real thing."

    "author": "El-Gorko",

The only way we could tell they weren’t ours was that their action worked slightly differently than in our mold. For reference, our molds were usually $100k+.\n\nThese features are kinda crazy to me on the controllers because the tool life will be pretty short. Probably half a million shots to keep that texture crisp. Given the volumes they produce, they’re gonna go through a few tools."

  {
    "author": "SwissPatriotRG",
    "text": "You know very little about machining and mold making I see.  Features that small would be near impossible to replicate perfectly. Even if scanned in with a laser CMM machine.  Then you have to machine them into tool steel with microscopic bits or EDM them into the mold. Replicating the general shape and dimensions of the controller is easy, that mold would still be relatively expensive to make a convincing product. But replicating all the little circles and squares and stuff over the surfaces is big $$$ moldmaking stuff.  Your average injection molding factory isn't going to have the equipment or desire to go through that trouble.  They'd more likely just bead blast a texture on the mold and call it good."
