    "text": "For once, India has great prices for something.\n\nOr, I guess the retro scene might be very different in India 🤔 Im guessing most sold copies are/were pirated, and I have at least gotten the picture that places like India, Brazil, etc, have really stuck longer on these older systems, so the retro scene probably hasn't developed in a similar manner there? Euro scene is somewhat healthy, but US scene has gone crazy with the prices. Almost all rare games are half price in Europe than what they are in the US, at least for PS2 stuff.\n\nEither way, God Hand is excellent.\n\nI was going to also say that the price you mentioned for the system was maybe a hint higher than I would be comfortable paying, even with the full package, but it isn't outside of reasonable either, and might actually be a perfectly normal price for a system in India. I would personally consider 50-60€ for full system average, 100€ or more to be way too much. Loose units go for much less, but if you get a really good quality controller (original, feels good) or even two, then 70$ sounds worth considering. More recent third party/knock off controllers simply aren't as good as originals.\n\nAlso, if your TV has Component inputs, you should get Component cables for the console. It will improve the picture quality greatly."
