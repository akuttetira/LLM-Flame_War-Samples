I find their games to be more based on gameplay/storyline/free updates instead of trying to nickel and dime their customers with fancy big name sequels and costly, underwhelming, dlc/grinding.\n\nBased on a quick glance at steam I have put more hours into those games than any AAA title I own.\n\nSadly the wife loves the Overcooked franchise so I get hit with those dlc costs (also the only dlc I own)."

Nobody votes with their wallet anymore. So, why would they care what anyone thinks?"

Fucking hunting flowers and pumping 600 rounds of .22 into an animal to 'knock it out' so you can take a sample? Oh and if you hunt in your offtime the fucking hippy chick throws your ass naked in the woods. R* is actively trying to kill RDR2 online."

    "text": "To anyone who doesn't know, the main way to get gold (the main currency to pay for effectively DLCs in game) was egregiously nerfed. After a month of daily playing (doing daily challenges) you maxed out your multiplier for gold gains at 2.5X normal, and you kept the multiplier forever if you kept playing daily.\n\nIn the latest patch, not only was the amount of gold per daily challenge cut in half, but the multiplier resets after a month. IE before the patch on day 29 you'd be making 0.5 gold per challenge. Now on day 29 you're making 0.1 gold per challenge. It's a pretty big fuck you considering the new DLC content they released costs a total of 55 full gold bars to buy. I don't want to do the math but needless to say, your grinding for a damn long time, and those Gold bar bundles you can buy from R* for real money start to look a lot more appealing"

I mean I have no doubt in my mind that GTA 6 will have a great story, but after that I'd bet well get more of the same. Why? Because we encourage them to do so"

And youd get a multiplier- they've taken that away but I haven't been on to see how- dont think I ever will be on again. No matter he suggestions I put in, theyll never implement them. The only one they added after a large request for it was corsets. But they're over the womens shirt not under, which is weird."

So that's not likely either."
