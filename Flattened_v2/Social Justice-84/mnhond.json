That's also why they're so easily offended when the left points something out that the right would rather stay in the shadows.\n\nThis is also why the right is so terrible at political humor and doesn't get satire. Shout out to r/TheRightCantMeme while we're here."

And oh boy, where did they find them, in alt-right and religious fanatics. They actively go against their own interests, I don't understand how can someone be so blinded by hate that they'll accept worse conditions for everyone, even themself, just to make it worse for some group they decided to demonise.\n\n\nWhile tankies and other fashies... Well, the fashies are gonna fash."
