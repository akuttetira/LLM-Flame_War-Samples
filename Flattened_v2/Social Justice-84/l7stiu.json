    "text": "> there's a lot of general alt-right stuff there as well.\n\nThe alt-right stuff was always the end goal. But it always starts out with something that a reasonable person would support. No New Normal is *supposedly* about opposing \"endless lockdowns\". And who *would* support endless lockdowns? And that's the point, by suggesting that you need to oppose it, they suggest that the are people that support it that you need to be fighting. And to a perfectly normal person, this seems like a perfectly normal position.\n\nBut then it's (((them))) that are pushing for the lockdowns. And then the deep state intentionally designed the virus so they could push the lockdowns. And then this and then that and then suddenly you're exposed to Q. And everyone at /r/qanoncasualties knows how that ends up."
