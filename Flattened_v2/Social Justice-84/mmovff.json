    "text": "You'll never be able to talk sense into all of them and the ones you miss can and will suck the ones you pull out right back in. All the while they'll be getting new people in by putting out the message that these beliefs are okay to have. The more they're in the light the more they'll normalize their beliefs.\n\nHate like theirs is not rational, as tempting as it is to want to rationalize it. The solution isn't to talk with them, because when you confront them as much as it appears they're talking to you they're not, their arguments are never for you, it's for those around you who are already sympathetic to their message. They don't make arguments, they speak in propaganda and propaganda isn't to convert the non-believers: it's to reinforce the convictions of those who already believe it in whatever capacity. The Liberal concept of freedom of speech does not work against them because the ideals behind \"free speech\" assume everyone is coming to the table in good faith. So \"free speech\" can only work in their favor as they've found Liberalisms weakness: it assumes everyone is a rational actor and since everyone is a rational actor it has no way of dealing with those not acting rationally.\n\nYou defeat them by making their beliefs so taboo as to become unthinkable, so that even when it does show up it suppresses itself out of fear of the ostracization it will illicit."

I got ostracized by a group that force-in-numbers decided that it was okay to dehumanize certain people but I stand by my conviction that it is not okay.\n\nReally there should be more of a balance.  Don't let anyone echo-chamber because if they go far enough underground that they only have sympathetic ears, you are going to lose the ones that benefit from coming out of those echo-chambers."

  {
    "author": "NuclearOops",
    "text": "I do not know what that group is but I am willing to bet that you were not as ostracized as I'm suggesting. We need to treat the kind of bigotry we see from hate groups with the same level of abhorrence as we do pedophilia as a society. That comparison is justified too, as hate speech and white supremacy and homophobia and so many others is comparably as harmful both physically and mentally as the results of pedophilia if not more so because they're more accepted than pedophilia. Sure there are havens of pedophiles online and they too form their own echo chambers, but they don't have any popular news networks supporting their beliefs, their echo chambers are dark and secretive because if anyone finds out they belong to them the individuals lives will be ruined.\n\nOf course there are those who do extend empathy to pedophiles and I respect that empathy but they only extend that empathy as though they are sick. When the most empathy a white supremacist can expect to receive in our society is as patients and victims of foul circumstance, then we can talk about convincing them away from their terrible condition. While there's still so many of them to help support the individuals conditions, they will congregate, they will form echo chambers, and they will loudly spread their message. You may be able to thwart them from time to time, but you will forever be playing wack-a-mole with them.\n\nWhatever the case, I'm not offering a perfect solution by suggesting we ostracize them, I'm really only offering what I see as the most effective harm reduction. They're like cockroaches (ideas, not people) and once they're introduced you can't get rid of them, all you can do is keep them from feeding and growing and banish them to the darker corners."

MAP is a group that you want to know who they are and try to help keep them from hurting anyone.  Once they've gotten caught hurting someone, well we have laws in place already that assume they are human.\n\nWhite supremacists have at least one entire town to themselves.  I just looked for when the KKK was last openly active around here because I knew it was recent... 2021.  Do you think that reopening all of the gay conversion camps and repurposing them for white supremacists is a viable idea, because I don't think ignoring the nests is going to help when there are that many in one area."
