And even if you report them **repeatedly**, reddit dot fucking com does little to nothing.  Sometimes, even sub mods stay silent."

    "text": "Reddit doesn't do a god damned thing about stalkers unless individual comment content posted is actually actionable, and obviously so.\n\nIf a troll wants to stalk your account and post 'lolololo' on every single one, good luck getting that dealt with. You _may_ be able to get individual subs to ban the behaviour, sometimes, maybe, good luck. As for sitewide? Fat fucking chance.\n\nAnd I've only been on the receiving end of basement dwelling trolls doing such. I cannot imagine what it would be like to get on the radar of one of these groups.\n\nThe only saving grace for Reddit is the level of community moderation available. It would be an absolute cesspool if it wasn't for that."

However it can be almost _impossible_ to reply to these comments in a way that does not break rules.\n\nSo disinformation, racism, abuse, trolling etc ends up actually being _protected_ from even being countered, never mind being called out for what it is.\n\nI don't have a lot of bans in subs, but every single one I was banned for calling out the worst of this kind of shit."
