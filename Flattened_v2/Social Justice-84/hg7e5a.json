    "text": "Hi, former mod of PublicFreakouts here speaking on an alt account. You're wrong here, no one banned blatant racism. That sub is garbage. There is 1 mod that actually cares about removing the racist bullshit but they hold themselves back a lot because if you really go after racists, as I did, you get removed from the mod team with no communication as to why (because the top mods are racist assholes). The guy who created that sub is never there, so mrhodesit is the main guy on the totem pole. I had multiple occasions where I banned a racist asshole for just cause, documented everything as per the mod rules and came back the next day to that exact person having their privileges reinstated because they had reached out to hodesit privately to complain about how their racist dog whistling was not \"actually racist.\" His sidekick is the notorious AssuredlyAThrowAway who is well known to this sub and many old timers on Reddit for his moderation of r/conspiracy and his obsession with himself. Hodesit and AATA being high up on the mod list mean PublicFreakout will never concentrate on banning blatant racism nor do they \"curate\" what is posted.\n\nActualPublicFreakouts was created because a few of the more active PF posters got salty when the sub had a few posts hit the front page that didn't technically have \"freakouts\" in them. When they pointed this out to the mods, none of us really cared. It wasn't a big deal that stuff like that gets posted but it hurt their feelings that they didn't get what they wanted so they created APF and knew the best chance of getting people to switch over would be to start that narrative of \"oh well PublicFreakout has a liberal agenda now\" because videos of police assaulting protesters went up around that time on PF. LOOOOOL. No. If you saw what went on behind the scenes, PublicFreakout is a place for racist white supremacists to feel safe and has been purposefully made to be this way."

    "text": "Jesus, I’m glad to have this context. I’ve always tried to downvote people being racist in PF, since it generally seems like reports never got anything done in the sub. I know plenty of people have tried to defend the freak-outers themselves, but I thought it was more of a Devil’s Advocate thing rather than racism. With the overwhelming amount of videos documenting racism and police violence, I thought the purpose of the sub was more to showcase the nutjobs and call them out for it. I guess I have to reevaluate my decision to browse it if there are so many racists that take refuge there.\n\nI always thought “at least i’m not on ActualPublicFreakouts,” because they’re explicitly hateful. It’s too bad they’re also hateful in a secretive way on the main sub."

A huge chunk, if not most of the comments were \"just let him shop\" \"why are you being rude\" \"you shouldnt be tried in the court of public opinion just because you're on video\", \" oh yeah well black people do ___\" \"he was a rookie, he just made one mistake\"."
