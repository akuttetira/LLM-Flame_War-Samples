    "text": "I know a ton of hyper conservative Jews who will stand by Trump come hell or high water, which totally boggles my mind considering how he surrounds himself with anti-Semites and his supporters literally wave Nazi flags.\n\nI don’t want to tell Jews how to feel on issues, nor how they should regard their own highly complex history and how it is shaping the world today, but I’ll never understand such unwavering support for a man who emulates Hitler. The only thing I can think of is the GOP’s support of Israel, but even then, it’s not like the Democrats don’t support Israel - they just speak up against crimes against Palestinians and don’t give Israel a blank check of morality.\n\nIt could also be a generational thing. Most of my Jewish friends are under 30, and the vast majority of them are Democrats, support Israel, but also speak up for the human rights of Palestinians. It’s mostly the older generation that view absolute support of Israel as the sole determining factor, which I can understand, but again, it doesn’t make much sense since the Democrats have also always backed Israel, except on the issue of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Also, it’s not like the Democrats don’t condemn violence by Palestinian extremists against Israelis."

US evangelicals believe doing so will bring about the apocalypse so it's an alliance of convience to achieve a shared goal. Would wager, by extension, the type of Jewish person who's in favor of such a plan probably considers left-leaning Jews \"fake\" and thus not worth worrying about"

If he selectively didnt cozy up to Trump we would instantly alienate the entire GOP. I'm sorry politics has gotten so bad in the US that now everything is this partisan, but were just trying to keep good relations tbh."

    "text": "Oy vey. For one, our PMs would be far left by any american standards, but that's besides the point. Your description of things is actually so ludicrous, that it has been depicted before in a comic the New York times apologizes for for being anti-semitic: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.newsweek.com/nyt-anti-semitic-cartoon-apology-blind-dog-benjamin-netanyahu-trump-jewish-1407634%3famp=1\n\nI want to point out that despite the hype, the Israeli lobbying effort is similar to the lobbying efforts of other middle east countries. When you combine the arab league lobbying, Israel is basically a drop in the bucket. The idea that we somehow control the US and \"lead them by a leash\" is ludicrous.\n\nAnd from a policy perspective, this is true as well. Many of Netanyahus voters were promised annexation this year, and he was forced to do an about face when the US backed off from the issue. But the US has effected Israeli policy over and over, decade after decade, as it has in all middle eastern countries thanks to a leash of its own: military assurances and assistance.\n\nTrump does not dance to Bibi's tune. He is dancing to his psychotic evangelical voters who believe their messiah will come when all the jews come to Israel and theres some apocalyptic war. Bibi is simply leveraging as much of that as he can into his own agenda.\n\nEDIT Also, I didnt address the second part as I didnt have time. But suffice to say, I largely agree, although not on the specifics. We def need a two state solution. Israelis are split on this around 60-40 (60 against, 40 for) imo. It used to have a lot more support, but when we pulled out of gaza and gave them sovereignty, a generation of kids who are now voters will only remember hiding from the rockets. The disastrous outcome has pretty much dried up support, and from a strategic perspective, it is to some extent understandable. The west bank could be a HUGE disaster if it isnt handled right, as unlike gaza we cant embargo them if they start launching rockets every day. This would mean that Iran could treat the west bank much like it has Lebanon, and we'd end up with another 100,000+ rocket stockpile on our border, leaving us with three borders piled with rockets, and no safe area within Israeli borders. Despite this, I think we clearly DO need to negotiate a two state solution, we just need to find a way to ensure it ends in peace, not pieces. Trust me, the West Bank would not benefit if we did a half ass pullout, only to be forced to invade a few months later in another war. And from a more personal perspective tbh, it is difficult to explain what it is like actually BEING here when talking about these issues than having an \"armchair\" discussion. Talking about the iron dome is all well and good until you're running with your kids to a bunker on a regular school day, not sure if you'll get there before the shrapnel kills you or your baby. This is a reality that pretty much all Israelis excluding tel aviv have experienced, and it definitely DOES influence policy here."

    "text": "That's a different case. Supposedly Haganah got weapons from a source in Germany:\n\n> Mr. E. Dekel, a former Hagana officer, reveals in his study of Hagana intelligence activities that between 1933 and 1935, some 300 barrels of cement were shipped from a fictitious exporter in Belgium ta a fictitious importer in Jaffa, in reality the Hagana. [cites to footnote 3 of page 131] According ta Dekel, about half of the barrels contained, in addition to the cement, 100 lb. containers filled with Mauser pistols and ammunition. Dekel does not indicate the exact source of these arms, but it seems certain that they originated in Germany, as indicated in the Polkes-Eichmann conversations in Berlin in early 1937. The source within Germany remains a mystery. Although most of their records were destroyed during the war, the Mauser-Jagdwaffen GmbH [name underline in original text] has informed this author that the firm did provide the Ministry of the interior with large quantities of model C96, which appeared in 1932.[cites to footnote 1 of page 132]. It is known from Dekel's study that Hagana agents were actively seeking arms and ammunition all over Europe during the-1930's, and from the SS records on Polkes that Hagana agents were active in Germany at that time.[cites to footnote 2 of page 132] While it cannot be determined at this point who exactly, provided the pistols ta the Hagana, it is certain that someone in Germany did, and that the police authorities were aware of it."

If they're Orthodox, it's likely a combination of \"religious freedom,\" support for Israel, and the same distrust of secular authority/education that other Trump supporters have.  There's also, amazingly, anti-immigrant sentiment (although racism among the more insular communities is far from unheard of).  For the others, they're usually wealthy and lumping themselves in with other wealthy people.\n\nNo Jew I know personally support Trump, but there are a few vocal ones over in r/judaism who pipe up in politics threads."

It's not a binary issue of \"all-in, unrestricted support without any criticism at all\" vs. \"wipe it off the face of the world\". You can support Israel while also being critical of its policies. \"Support\" doesn't mean blind obedience. Hating **any** Jew for their Jewish heritage is anti-Semitic, no matter where they sit on the political spectrum."

It's just that anti Zionism means \"opposition to a Jewish state\"(and as you know, Jewish state does not mean that people of other ethnicities don't get to be citizen's) so I assume they think Isreal shouldn't exist when they say things like f Zionism.\n\nIt's 100 percent possible to be critical of it without being anti semetic.
