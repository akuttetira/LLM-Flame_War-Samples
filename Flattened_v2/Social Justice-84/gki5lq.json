PM:\n\n>[–]from DebbieDoneDidDallas  sent 3 minutes ago\n\n>>Your second link the dude is light skinned, the first link is literally a person running into an automatic door that didn't open.\n\n>>By the third & fourth link you provided it's enough to see you're seeking out anything you can turn into racism, you're part of the problem, do better.. be better.\n\nDear \"Debbie,\"\n\nHave the guts to confront me in this subreddit, you coward. And if you can't because you've been banned from here, then that's a problem. For you.  You see, what you would be doing then is called \"ban evasion.\"  If you're banned from here, you can't participate. DMing me about the topic is forcing your way into participation."

In the comment, write out the subreddits you wish to support with examples of them violating the TOS.\n\nIn my submissions today I made sure in the comments to talk about how they're using 'jogger' as a substitute for n-slur.\n\nif they're committing ban-evasion by creating a new subreddit to serve the same purpose as a banned one, then also mention that in the subject _and_ the comment.  Show it."
