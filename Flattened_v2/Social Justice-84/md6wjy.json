I took classes in archery.” <-- they don't give archery ribbons in the real world. LMFAO thanks for the share.\n\nFor Huffman, it’s been a concern for years. “Ever since I saw the movie ‘Deep Impact\" does he not understand that if something like that actually happened, it would wipe out most life on the planet? anything left would not be happy campers. No wonder reddit is so fucked up, fantasists are running the show.\n\nHuffman: \"I will probably be in charge, or at least not a slave, when push comes to shove.” sorry but this just keeps getting more and more hysterical. he wants to create a post-apocalyptic version of reddit LOL!!\n\nI hope these poor saps are doing more than just getting eye surgery. tl;dr reddit is run by an oligarch who refuses to take any responsibility for the mess he helped create. smdh\n\nOne of them says, “If we had a more equal distribution of income, and much more money and energy going into public school systems, parks and recreation, the arts, and health care, it could take an awful lot of sting out of society. We’ve largely dismantled those things.” <-- it's a vicious cycle, they say its unfair they're so rich, yet they tell the politicians they put into office that unless they transfer even more wealth, they'll be voted out of office.\n\nJohnson asked. “What does that really tell us about our system?” He added, “It’s a very odd thing. You’re basically seeing that the people who’ve been the best at reading the tea leaves—the ones with the most resources, because that’s how they made their money—are now the ones most preparing to pull the rip cord and jump out of the plane.” <-- these people actually smoke their own supply and believe that they made it on their own. what a joke.\n\nOn Huffman: \"He has witnessed how social media can magnify public fear. \" I would actually say that he has stood by while his website enabled public fear to be magnified.\n\ngood read."

Counterintuitively, they all actually draw their power *from* their **impotence**.  Now most people can't do it at all, and neither can they, normally.  However, they are able to hypnotize themselves via several hours of either reactionary YouTube, Fox News or even AM radio in a pinch, and by doing so they enter a trancelike state where normal cortical function ceases and the brain is able to focus all of it's energy on convincing themselves that their profundity of **impotence** is magically someone else's fault.  This allows them to channel that **impotence** through their MTN DEW conduit straight into their Dorito gland and generate immense amounts of **impotent rage**.\n\nKnowing this, the trick is to simply remind them that their **impotence** actually belongs to them, that they are the thing that is always standing in their way and **nothing** they do **will** ever **matter**, and it disrupts this psychic channeling.  Usually they’ll just slink off to their Nazi-nest or Loli-den where they soothe themselves through a ritual of masturbation & yelling at minorities on xbox-live.  Then they are able to re-hypnotize themselves.  The whole process takes anywhere from 6-18 hours, depending on their level of lack of fitness, which is more than enough time for them to get mad about something else that either isn’t real or doesn't affect them, so you usually won’t hear from them again for a day or two, if at all."

It's that other people who share other parts of her identity shouldn't be thrown under the bus or have to see hurtful misgendering/transphobia. They're catching identity based flak when we use their identity as a cudgel against jerks."
