Its brilliant as a meme. They also did \"Its OK to be white\" These one liners cause chaos with the far left intersectionalists. **They don't know how to respond.**\n\n(emphasis mine)\n\nThis kind of thinking must be why they've turned politics into such a team sport.  Apparently they think you can either criticize a group or support a group, but not both, and surely not for different policies or topics I guess."

This \"religionization\" of politics, which is basically making political ideologies into nothing more than relgious beliefs, for which all of them are made out to be fairy tales which have no relation to reality and are therefore equal, is really what's going on here. And mostly caused by heavily religious conservatives, republicans and right-wingers. This how they succeed; through the lie of centrism."
