White people (because i already know it's white people) labeling chinese people as being all sorts of things because of covid-19 when the reality is that they didn't have notice or advanced warning. And still they've handled it better than majority white countries who did have notice and advanced warning."

I don't think anyone should be praising China's handling of the virus considering they covered up the existence for a while, arrested anyone trying to spread information about it, and have blatantly lied about the case count and death count, and then only contained it by forcibly barricading people into their own homes, which cause many people to starve to death.\n\nObviously the racist garbage coming out of these subs is unwarranted, but let's not start sucking the Chinese government's dick  over this just so we can play the foil."

I live in HK, and I have firsthand knowledge that the response both here and on the mainland is far more effective than the one in the United States.  Just because western countries are responding poorly does not mean the PRC isn’t responding well, “but the sneaky chinaman is hiding it” or some shit like that.  The local government in Wuhan was the source of the attempted coverup of the flu in like December.  The national government deployed the army to deliver food to people in their homes."

I'm just pointing out that their coverup contributed to the problem and that people shouldn't be praising a government that arrested a bunch of people trying to spread information about it at the start of it, and is now lying about how many cases and deaths they have. Maybe if they were more transparent and honest about the devastation it was causing, the rest of the world wouldn't have say on their hands for so long."

    "text": "Right. So somehow i'm not only over reacting but sucking china's dick by saying..simply...which is a fact...they're currently doing it better than majority white countries are. Given the FACT that they didn't have advanced warning but majority white countries did.\n\nSo basically you're so caught up in AMERICA FUCK YEAH!!! that even facts emotionally trigger you enough to ignore that everything i said was, is and will continue to be fact.\n\nIt's not praise. Stating facts is now praise. Where you clawed that one from out the crack of your ass i do not know.\n\nAgain.\n\nTHEY WERE on the front lines. Had no chance to prepare for this. And are doing better. Majority white countries had...months...MONTHS to prepare. And still not only fucked it up but will continue to fuck it up.\n\nAgain. These are facts. Not praise. Not sucking dick. Facts.\n\nOh and don't forget. Many of the things you're fake upset with china about our government did and is doing as we speak. With their being a massive chance they will get worse over time.\n\nI mean...did you forget that america and the uk also let people starve to death way before covid-19? Did you forget how both countries treated and are treating people of color?\n\nRight. What you see as sucking china's dick is just you sucking on trump's and republican's."

It is not binary, you don't have to praise the Chinese government at all. Why are you doing it? I feel like a lot of people are starting to reflexively defend the CCP just so they can take an opposite stand to the \"warmongering racist shits.\"\n\nRepublicans are awful, but the Chinese government is also awful, and much more so. Stop praising the Chinese government! They are committing genocide, oppress their own people and police their thoughts, and recently actively covered up a deadly pandemic that is now plaguing the entire planet, and lied to everyone about how bad it was. Is that really a good response? Jesus."

Go look through my post history, you'll find me arguing with people about why it's racist to call it \"The Chinese Virus\" and why Trump is calling it that to shift blame from himself to China.\n\nThat being said, I'm also not going to start praising the Chinese government and pretending that they didn't literally arrest doctors and citizens that tried spreading information on the virus which directly led to the rest of the world being unprepared for the seriousness of this.\n\nTell me, how many deaths are there actually in China from this virus? Because it sure as shit isn't 3,000. Which means the Chinese government is lying.\n\nYour usage of whataboutism and accusations of racism to defend a Chinese government that is literally genociding Uighur Muslims this very moment is ridiculous. Pointing to the US governments genocide of native Americans or other shitty policies of the past or present does not mean the Chinese government is good."

The Chinese government covered this up and fueled this pandemic and we can't even know if their brutal methods to slow the spread even worked because we have no idea how many cases and deaths they actually had. It's definitely not 3,000. It could be 30,000, or 300,000. Who even knows?\n\nJust because a bunch of racists are making this about Chinese people and culture doesn't mean that non-racists need to rally around the lies that the the genocidal Chinese government is spreading."
