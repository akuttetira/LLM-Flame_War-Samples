It has to do with the treatment of people and use of force policies.\n\nIn fact, all one has to do is scroll down in that exact poll that you posted to find the actual problem.\n\n\"Confidence About Receiving Positive Treatment By the Police\" where 56% of white americans are 'very confident' and only 18% of black americans are.\n\nSo your entire argument is disingenuous cherry picking to try to service your racism."

If you asked pointed questions about specific actions officers should and shouldnt take, you will discover the general public is far closer to the requests of BLM than they are supporting the current law enforcement regime whole cloth.\n\nThey *also* want policing, like your link shows. Its immaterial to this line of discussion."

That type of dishonest methodology keeps vast swaths of the right wing hate machine alive, else it would wither on the vine like conspiracists.\n\nE: while i am sympathetic with the end of your edit, it has to be said that trump is merely a symptom of americas ills, and removing him from office is the beginning of the process, not the end. We must dismantle violent racist rhetoric and the reactionary conservative outlets that spew it in order to divide us for their own gain.\n\nThat last bit will require uncovering the secretive ways these groups are being funded by entities hostile to the american way of life, and to our perpetual goal of a more perfect union. There is going to be a reckoning, and a lot of hard truths will have to come to light. In the timeless words of our previous first lady, be better."
