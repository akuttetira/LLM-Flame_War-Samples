Flew from DC on Air Force One to get there and say this alondside Trump. This is a deliberately constructed message."

Those who believe in black nationalism, that the USA should cede territory into a new country for black people, rather like the partition of india or the situation in Israel.  Obviously that is a ridiculously bad idea."

    "text": "i agree with you about Occupy and such organizations. The movement was organic, people were just pissed off at society. But they did not have a clear vision, clear figurehead and next to nothing financial backing. So not much was achieved.\n\nBLM seems very inorganic. It has huge financial backers, which can steer the narrative. Athough the movement has validity, in that their is disparity, and racism. They have some centralized ideas, like the push for police accountability.\n\nMy opinion is to never invalidate someones or a peoples plight and struggles. To not compare them to other struggles so as to lessen them either. But to learn and understand how they feel. But to also not ignore that their are many more disadvantaged people that have histories of persecution. Which is very similar to what others have gone through.\n\nNick Cannon is an example of these racists. They will hate people based on skin color. Although there is a Black, African American culture and ethnicity in the US. There is no such thing as the white race. It is a social construct that includes way too many ethnicities. Like saying all Africans are the same, or blaming all Europeans for the Slave trade(when many Eastern Europeans were used for the middle eastern slave trade). These individuals are just being exposed right now for their racism.\n\nMy worry is that history will repeat itself and the pendulum will swing hard the other way. For example, the most amount of Confederate statues were built after the civil rights movement, like a backlash to it. The people from the former confederate states still need cultural heroes. People hate being always put down. So they will accept the moniker and use it to empower themselves.\n\nThe best way to move forward is to involve all of us in this. People seem to forget about Abolitionists, that throughout history there have been individuals that changed their minds and stood up for injustice. We need room for that."

    "text": "I agree.  I think there is room for the celebration of southern abolitionists, I think that the history of racism should be looked upon with shame, but that fight should have heroes.  For modelling I would look at Germany, which teaches the crimes of the holocaust extensively, but does not make it out as if Germans are bad now because of it.\n\nThe problem is that everything is part of the culture wars now, so the reaction you predict is inevitable, and will IMO get worse.  We will have people saying slavery was ok in 3 years and that the north should have lost in 5 IMO."

    "text": "Yes, praising Abolitionists as role models. We dont have to change hsitory. Looking at Benjamin Franklin, who over the course of his life changed his stance on slavery. We need that room for growth or else people will just get more rooted in their narrow views.\n\nThis social engineering is just causing division. There are terms that are used to create more anger. Like White Privilege. Which doesnt exist. It is not universal. Those with light skin and yet on the poverty line do not have privilege. Only ones with privilege are the rich. Now, that's not to say that there is a black penalty( notice how im not taking away from the struggle). This penalty can also be applied to many other peoples including Immigrants, Liminal people(those that dont fit into nice categories), and even people with hard to pronounce names. There are many invisible minorities that are disadvantaged."

The movement is not entirely within the founders' control, as can be witnessed well enough by the twice-weekly rants from my local chapter about people using the BLM name who kneel with police, won't step up for black trans people, etc."
