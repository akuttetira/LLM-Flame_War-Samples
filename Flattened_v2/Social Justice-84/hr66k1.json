If so, what are her qualifications? I ask because whenever you get to the bottom of these questions it's always the exact same type of phony self-appointed moral authority as the conservatives."

    "text": "Hate to say it but you are talking about a group of women who will never see someone who was born male and who has transitioned to female, ever be considered female. It's nothing to do about transgender politics or gender identity, but everything to do (in their eyes) about gender oppression. They see someone who was born male and who has transitioned tell them that they are somehow privileged to have been born a woman. That though runs counter to the feminists underlying philosophy that it is they who are under-privileged because they were born female. To be told that by someone who used to be a man is anathema to them. It's a red rag to a bull.\n\nTo draw an analogy, its like someone being born rich telling someone who was born poor that they were lucky to be born poor because it means that they don't have to worry about spending money. To the feminist it makes no sense.\n\nFor a feminist (and this is not something that is restricted to \"radical\" ones but is slowly gaining wider spread acceptance as a viewpoint) it is just another way for men to denigrate them as women - nothing more and nothing less. They do not see that someone who suffers from gender dysphoria is anyone other than someone playing an elaborate game of \"dress-ups\". And they never will because the whole idea of someone surgically or medically changing their gender is - to them - a direct attack on who they are as a person.\n\nCalling them out using a phrase like TERF just forces them to double-down on their beliefs and instead of allowing them to see that people are just people, actually reinforces their beliefs that anything to do with trans (whether to be political or social) is just another attack by men on women.\n\nI can sort of understand the frustration that people in the trans community has towards feminists and especially those on the radical side (not being trans I'll never fully understand of course) but it's a fight that you can never win. Nazis and extremists you can beat - they are just political points of view after all - but in this you'll just be beating your heads against a granite wall.\n\nKnock that sub down and all you are doing is reinforcing in them their belief that the patriarchy (and no matter the rights or wrongs, in this case they see transwomen as just being a sub-group of the male of the species) is hell bent on subjugating them. You may win a battle but the war rages on with a fiercer intensity.\n\nPosts like this are just feeding their narrative.\n\nEdit: Like I care about downvotes but if you wish to bury your heads in the sand, it's no skin off my nose. I'm just offering a different perspective between two sets of radicals - radical trans and radical fem.\n\nEdit 2: Guess this sub is turning in a product of what they are campaigning about - just another group of people who hate another group of people because they can. /shrugs"

This hate is not feminist, it’s an appropriation of the language of feminism by people who betray the tenets of feminism.\n\nThere is no way to be a feminist which excludes trans people. And the majority position in feminism and radfem is that trans people are valid."

    "text": "Technically, you can't even really be feminist without considering the struggles of men, even if they're cis men.\n\nThe goal of feminism is gender equality and the empowerment of feminity. There is no minority or majority in gender politics, it's 50/50 by law of nature, so to suggest one gender needs to isolate themselves from the other would realistically just be two equally numbered sides waging war.\n\nTo ignore the struggles men go through as a result of their own poisoned masculinity is not only very outdated, it's outright ignoring how complex the issue of patriarchy is. A lot of misogyny is based in biological essentialism and general physical differences, not as a result of being different from the majority. So you need to break both sides away from the roles we carry out with each other. To hate men as a feminist is only creating rigidity in your life.\n\nSafe spaces for women and only women are important, yes, and there's a lot more nuance in general to this. But there's a reason the so called \"libfems\" give even cishet men a platform - because we can't eliminate gender roles without involving everyone with a gender."

    "text": "Not saying that it's a dominant position, but it is a position that is growing. The problem is that the hate, rather than remaining on the fringes, is slowly mainstreaming as it comes under more frequent attack.\n\nI mean it was barely heard of or recognised until it became a \"campaign\" issue. All these sort of posts do is feed it oxygen.\n\nI understand the reasoning for the attacks on these sorts of stances but sitting in the mainstream I'm here to tell you that it is counterproductive to what is trying to be achieved.\n\nEdit: Guess it's buckets of sand all round. Oh well, enjoy your bubble while you fight other people in their bubbles."

    "text": "\"i'm wrong and I refuse to engage with people's arguments about why I'm wrong so instead I'll call them an echo chamber and complain about downvotes\" is why you're getting downvoted.\n\nDeplatforming hate does work and has been proven to work. Terfs have been \"in the mainstream\" recently because you have had some rich people with big platforms pushing terf ideas, while at the same time christian rights groups are funding campaigns against trans people's rights. (In the UK at the moment)."

It sounds like you're saying that trans men and trans women aren't even allowed to hold ordinary political opinions because they're considered unusual as persons. Uhh... how do you not see the problem with this.\n\nIt really sounds like you are misunderstanding the point of feminism, which, you know, is not anybody else's job to solve but yours. Like I get it that you're not up to date on your reading list, but leave trans people the fuck out of it. It's not their job to help you understand just because they exist. They didn't invent the patriarchy, they are just dealing with the consequences of it, just like everyone else has to."

Their intolerance of trans people is based in bigotry, not reason, and throwing trans people under the bus in order to appease them isn't going to work because, whatever their rhetoric, they're not actually trying to protect their own rights, they're trying to harm a group that they don't like."

    "text": "No one is denying them their own struggle. There's no game of \"oppression Olympics\" or anything. We get even cis women deal with bullshit, and we get our struggles through transitioning are independent to their own struggles.\n\nThat being said, a lot of TERFs seem to be the women who have it best-off and that is worth drawing attention to.\n\nHow many black women have you seen be TERFs? Or severely impoverished women? Or physically disabled women?\n\nThey exist, but frequently these \"gender critical\" women are white, suburban/middle class, and live stable and functional lives.\n\nTo insinuate these women feel GENUINELY threatened raises suspicion to me. If that were the case they'd be focused on a more likely enemy to them - wealthy white men. They're just using their only point of disenfranchisement as a vessel to carry their hateful thoughts towards trans people, however.\n\nIt's really just a big game of self righteousness in the end, and if you pay attention to some of their views you can see a lot of them are very \"traditional\" and actually contradict their own feminism. They often times seem to encourage nuclear families, and they think the most powerful thing you can do as a woman is have children. They think promiscuity is bad, and believe it to be the exploitation of women and not an expression of their own empowerment. They chastise and patronize trans men as being \"sickly women too weak to think for themselves\" and remove their autonomy. Maybe if this was the 1980s their views would be considered radical feminism, but the only thing radical about their views relative to modern politics is their radical hatred of trans people lol.\n\nIt's all a front, they don't care about fighting their own oppression. Misogyny isn't carried out 0.3% of the population (trans women) and their followers on Twitter and these people know this. It's carried out by wealthy white conservative men, who you oftentimes see them partnering up with. I've seen \"gender critical radfems\" in alt-right subreddits frequently. The alt-right isn't exactly pro-womans rights last I checked. Why are they mingling with cisgender misogynists (who are often times white nationalists as well) if they're so worried about the transgender misogynists?"
