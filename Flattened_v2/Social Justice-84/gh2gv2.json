I mean the fact the colour is basically solid and everything around it is grainy as fuck was real convincing.\n\nAs for the hammer the claim a grainy object on the ground was a hammer that he threw away before the confrontation.  It has no head and something protruding in the middle of the \"handle\" and looks remarkably like a stick or road kill.  Also someone did a slowmo replay of the video with the object circled as soon as it came into view and before he even reached the area.\n\nBut they are not letting that get in the way of their racism.\n\nThey also claim its a hot pursuit of someone just caught on CCTV robbing a house.  But no CCTV or robbery reported.\n\nAgain just making shit up"
