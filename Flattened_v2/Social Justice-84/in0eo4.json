Often they genuinely care for their community, however they are either naive or willfully blind to what the Hateful Idiots actually get up to.\n\n\nPCM could have been a decent community but the Useful Idiots never learn that PCM's mods are Hateful Idiots who don't care about the sub and will gleefully hasten it's demise.  The PCM cult is very much like the [FrenWorld cult](https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/bjwbln/rfrenworld_is_a_look_into_just_how_acceptable_and/)."

Which they would never do because it's always the most intolerant who pretend you have to include intolerant views in discussions out of some disingenuous sense of \"fairness.\"\n\nFrankly you'd probably have to extend that to libright too, since they're just authright cosplaying as something less stigmatized. And at that point it's just r/politicalhumor. So I guess you're right, it is doomed to fail."

You don't see any nuanced theory memes like that on PCM\n\nthird one is making fun of an-caps thinking nazis are socialist. An-cap in general is made fun of a lot.\n\nHow about you actually look into things more instead of being the reactionary that we are so often sterotyped as here, okay?"

Dog whistle for AuthRight.\n\nIt’s biggest push was in the South as segregation got banned. So whites decided they’d rather have no public schools than forced to integrate and libertarian ideology was useful as political cover to privatize services to continue segregation in another form.\n\n(Note, that liberal whites in NYC effectively did the same thing under the banner of progressive education as they sent their kids to private schools or other effectively segregated schools )\n\nSo the libright will pretend they disagree with authright on all sorts of things they agree on.\n\nAs for AuthLeft, I feel most are either cosplayers or tankies far more into authoritarian politics than anything smacking of left wing.\n\nSo under the PCM ideology, we’re a narrow slice of minority views trying to suppress their view. Except of course the truth is they’re all either alt right or being groomed for it"
