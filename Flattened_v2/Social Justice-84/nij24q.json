    "text": "Reposting my previous comment from another post on this here so people realise the actual filth that sub is:\n\nFor those out of the loop, india has a domestic terrorist organisation called the RSS. It’s founders were Hitler fan boys and literally honour the fanatic who assassinated Mahatma Gandhi, lovingly called the father of the Indian nation. Gandhi was also the inspiration for Martin Luther King Jr and his non violence mantra was inspired by Gandhi himself.\n\nThis domestic terror group runs a few websites and social media pages, one such page is the aforementioned chodi. This page is exactly like The_Donald was where a professional PR firm uses memes and misinformation to radicalise the less educated crowd. The sub violates all hate speech / misinformation ad spam related policies but since Reddit has ignored this till now, I will be more specific and post the exact violation below.\n\nReddit released a new and updated police last year and their Rule 1 states “Rule 1 explicitly states that communities and users that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned. There is an expanded definition of what constitutes a violation of this rule, along with specific examples, in our Help Center article.”\n\nChodi is a blatant violation of Rule 1 and should have been banned last year itself when this policy was updated. It looks like Reddit admins are waiting for a terror styled shoot out by one of their fanatics before taking action.\n\nI urge everyone to report that sub and I urge the Reddit admins to take a note of this instead of waiting for people to die in a pogrom / riot / shoot out before taking action. Also a special shout out to the AHS mods, this sub is the reason we are made aware of propaganda and misinformation subs and can keep Reddit a fun place minus the hate."

Any organisation that’s built upon Hitler / Nazi ideology is a terrorist organisation.\n\nI’m hoping you’re not too far gone that you’ll start posting anti Muslim / Christian / Sikh things. These are all minority groups who are equal citizens and always will be.\n\nTo end, treat your body like you treat your mind. Junk food makes you fat and junk news makes you stupid. The fact that you’re hating your own countrymen because they are a different religion is emblemic of how that sub is radicalising unsuspecting single men who are either incels or MGTOW."
