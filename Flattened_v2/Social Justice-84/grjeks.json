It's not.\nConfusion of the highest order.\nI am a human rights defender when people dont commit crimes. But they committed in my book one of the biggest crimes of humanity.\nThey should be persecuted on the spot. Kill them\n\nAh yes. Gay people existing is somehow a crime against humanity, but genocide is not. That's lovely.\n\nBy the way, [here's the link to the original comment on Ceddit. ](https://snew.notabug.io/r/unpopularopinion/comments/gqyff4/lgbtq_mega_thread/frz2fme/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) I'm not sure how other archive sites work, so I just pulled it up using that."

This hate spewing has gone on full force in the last 24 hours where previously there doesn't appear to be any. The user previously commented like a normal redditor and even made [a post where they talked about wanting to be a better person] (https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/ffll65/how_to_be_a_nicer_person/). They previously said they were Islamic and from the Netherlands and in the last 24 hours they claim to be Christian from a small African country, shitting on the Netherlands.\n\nI don't know if \"hacked\" is the right word, but I really do feel this guy got his account taken over by someone who wants to get him banned."

Strip away that veil and up until recently, I wondered whether folks would really say the hateful stuff they do to someone else's face.\n\nSo long as there are no consequences, they absolutely will and they are emboldened by a culture that now encourages this sort of thing driven by their \"leadership\".  If they get caught saying horrible shit, they wring their hands and cry about decorum and censorship.  It's dumb, smirking idiocy at its core.  The only rights they care about are their own.  We have reached the pinnacle of selfish, entitled bullshit."
