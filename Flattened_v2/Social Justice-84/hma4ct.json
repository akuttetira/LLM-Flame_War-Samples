Child may be mocked for believing himself to be a wizard, but believing itself to be a different gender will cause child much trouble from others. I mean, if you read any descriptions of transitions you'll know that it is often a demaning and hard part of life even in supportive enviroment. Wizard delusion can make you a weirdo, gender delusion will make you weirdo squared because society is very \"gender-concious\".\n\nRisk of trans child being denied his true gender nees to be balanced with that.

The acceptance plays a huge role in the suicide rate after all, probably most of it.\n\nOf course, that means other people are the problem, not trans people. And forcing yourself to not come out can be just as dangerous if not more. But being 24 now I can handle whatever comes at me with ease while progress moves at its slow pace. I’m not trying to make a case against it, I just think it can be a complex topic.\n\nIt makes me think of how today black kids are told to be weary of police or stay out of sight of them. Or back when gays were viewed as lesser, they were told to not display affection in public. It just feels like how you have to play to survive as a target, sadly."

Teenagers have been prosecuted in the US for underage sex. Some states have Romeo and Juliet laws which prevent cases being prosecuted.\n\nYou don't seem to be able to read very well.

In countries where they only hate one or the other (gays vs trans) that shared bond isn't present so the results will be different.\n\nConsider that, for example, the various American Indians were all of completely different tribes and cultures before colonialization.  Instead of fighting each other they banded together to fight a common enemy:  The invaders.  Now, because of that, they identify as one homogeneous group to outsiders because that's how outsiders see them.  But each American Indian knows what tribe they belong to and calls themselves that."
