    "text": "You've got a few types.\n\nI quite like the naive teenagers.  They've usually got good hearts.  They automatically think more freedom always leads to good, and just need a while to figure out why certain laws and regulations exist.\n\nSadly though, they're ideal targets for the ones you mention.  They love impressionable kids.\n\nThe most common other type is the tradesman who gets convinced by talk radio that they'd own a multinational enterprise by now if it wasn't for all the pesky regulation.\n\nBut there are so many more I could list them all day.  That's why the label is so stupid.  They're not anarchists.  They all believe in some level of regulation and state apparatus, but you have no idea whatsoever where any of them draw their lines until they make it clear.  Even the fuzziest political movements will have some kind of core principles, but the only thing you can know for sure about a Libertarian you just met is that they're at least a bit thick."
