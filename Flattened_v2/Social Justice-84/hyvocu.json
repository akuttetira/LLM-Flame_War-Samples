    "text": "Allowing a particular type of content to dominate encourages those mindsets when it's content made to radicalize. And that's what a lot of the reactionary comments that wind up there are for; these people *know* they will be crossposted to subs like negativewithgold and worstof and intentionally make somments to be downvoted, good, and wind up there. Then the mods of those subs allow hateful comments to remain and then we see what's happening to negativewithgold today."
