Here's a farfetched but hopefully apt comparison:\n\nIt's like arresting/prosecuting one member of the KKK vs banning the Klan altogether. Sure, on an individual basis the punishment is more severe in the former.

The amount of White Supremacist propaganda and \"ethnic replacement\" propaganda and other such material that's platformed on the subreddit makes it readily knowable to be materially about race, and materially about \"Caucasian\".\n\nOf course the political hacks in the GOP and the white supremacists they are allied with would **_love_** a test case that establishes legally that \"Caucasian\" is a persecuted ethnicity in the United States and on \"the liberal media\" -- including Social Media.\n\nThere's also a significant religious factor -- \"Judeo-Christian Values\" (despite the rampant antisemitism), as well as the core people operating the subreddit are theofascists. They platform talking points directly from other theofascists and Christian theocracies.\n\nNational Origin is easy: \"Americans\". Are they being discriminated against for being \"Patriotic Americans\", versus the \"illegal immigrants\" -- ?\n\n----\n\nThe things that they do and say, the things that Fox News and Breitbart and the other GOP mouthpieces and propaganda outlets publish, are not without aims and goals.\n\nThey are playing a long game, modeled after the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s, which they see as entirely \"special rights\", robbing them and their constituencies of \"equal rights\" under the law."
