    "text": "Why support blatant colonialism though? The settlements are what caused this issue. Israel claims to the UN that they have not been taking Palestinian land illegally after 1967's West Bank borders via settlements by saying that Palestine is not a state and all the land belongs to them, on a legal level. Yet if that is true, then you would have the equivalent of native \"designated areas\" in the US that are landlocked and totally dependent on the surrounding region economically who have people in them owned by Israel without Israeli citizenship. The more you read into it, the more it's textbook apartheid and/or colonialism. Zionism's only positive purpose is giving a safe place for Jews to live, but such a goal is possible without the ethno-nationalism. If Israel actually formed a single-state democracy instead of this, than the global left would actually be on Israel's side if Arab countries tried to attack it. But because of the context of Zionism, this isn't the case.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo why be Zionist other than fear? Because it seems like fear."

    "text": "Like I said, much of this is fear. Will Arabs continue to try and attack secular Israel? Yes. Is it much the same with Israel as it is? Probably. But. It is very possible for Israel to actually not be in a state of hypocrisy and still be safe. If suffrage has to happen one Palestinian screening at a time, so be it if in the end everyone who inhabits the claimed lands of Israel has Israeli citizenship. Israel is more than capable of filtering out dangerous individuals and groups while enabling citizenship for the rest. Quite frankly, a lot of the left’s problem with Israel is how the Likud party claims to uphold democratic values while apartheid sits on their front porch.\n\nSuffrage screening is not so scary, compared to the fear-mongering of Jews becoming an instant minority in Israel, now is it?"

    "text": "I'm talking about citizenship for Palestinians. As I explained earlier, Palestinians are not considered inhabiting their own country for legal reasons related to the definition of \"occupation\" by Israel in front of the UN, but because of this the Palestinian Authority is technically like a Native American Reservation Authority, except the people in the Palestinian Authorities don't have citizenship, while arguably illegal settlements continue to reduce the volume of that authority since the 1967 borders.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is the crux of the issue, one that alone creates the left's argument against Israel in most cases, and one that Israeli's typically don't answer straight too, because there's no winning. If the Palestinian territories are sovereign, then the occupation and settlement of the West Bank onwards should have been illegal. If the Palestinian territories aren't a nation or are under Israel, than Palestinian civilians should also have Israeli citizenship due to their extreme landlocked and scattered status and dependence on the cities and trade routes around them to function; they are functionally a part of Israel, since Israel settled the border between the West Bank and Jordan and cut them off there, and then settled inbetween the West Bank all over the place. This is the issue."

    "text": "Sure, as long as that future Palestine is the size of the 1967 border West Bank and Gaza is connected to Israel or Egypt in order for it to have a future. The problem is that Palestinians are even more nationalist than Israelis, so even if violence or disenfranchisement weren’t done by the state of Palestine against that minority, groups of people would still disenfranchise or hurt Israelis. It’s why Israel doesn’t consider the two-state 1967 solution viable, since they would have to move many Israelis out of the illegal settlements. But that doesn’t make the settlements not illegal. It just means that every time a deal is faux attempted with Palestine that doesn’t include the settlements or the settlement lands, Palestine will guaranteed reject the offer, and then Israel can SAY it has attempted a two-state solution, all while continuing to encroach with settlements. The Palestinians may be more backwards, but that has little todo with why the settlements are the main issue, wrong, and the cause of everything to begin with. Settlements that have encroached for decades until a two-state solution is no longer viable."

    "text": "Jews never really disappeared from the middle east and they were normally allowed to practice their faith with fewer problems than in so-called Christendom.\n\nThe issue was that by the end of the 19th Century, there was a wish to have a Jewish nation. This was partly to protect the European Jews who needed somewhere to move to and large numbers of immigrants was going to cause problems even if back then, nations didn't mean much in the Ottoman empire.\n\nSo roll forward to the formation of Israel. Surprisingly there was little in the way of expulsion on the middle east after the establishment of Israel in 1948. Arabs were unhappy about the nation, Zionism and tried to destroy it several times. It survived but the military and the orthodox started to dominate politics seeing a threat in the Arab reproduction rate. This followed an aggressive and discriminatory  expansion programme largely financed from outside. This linked Zionism with measures that were seen as unfortunate even by some Israeli Jews. A good friend left Israel for Germany, while she had faced issues while working as a social worker helping the disadvantaged there.\n\nZionism isn't necessarily bad, but it has become associated with the ultra conservatives both in Israel and the US."
