Like he was provided with dozens of videos of this guy being blatantly racist, and yet is still defending for the video to stay up... Says the only way he will remove it is if the admins themselves tell him too.\n\nWhat a fucking clown."

Just look at the reddit anouncements thread from a week or two ago most of the top posts were from mods of large subs that are not defaults asking spez for help and complaining about lack of responsivity to inquiries from the admins.\n\nAlso, where are all those options you were talking about? Your lack of response gives me the feeling that you are full of it."
