India in fact, likely faces a lot of the same criticisms as China, but is never criticized as harshly."

Constantly throwing tantrums about how they're not 100% adored and submitted to by every person on the planet.\n\nFascism, at it's core, is literally nothing more than an evolved version of the rage a tantruming child feels when they scream \"BUT I WANT IT!\" over and over. No reasoning, no principles, no ideals, only pure entitlement. It's ridiculous."

During the Gujarat riots internet wasn’t that common and still Indian sanghis murdered and raped many Muslims.\n\nRussia and China are slowly using this extremist population in India, USA, UK, etc. and is increasing their numbers by radicalization online. But that doesn’t mean bad people already don’t exist."
