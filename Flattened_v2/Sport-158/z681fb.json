Along with the Olympics, we were twice the world champs in tennis, twice in water polo, once in handball,  and a bunch of individual athletes were champions in their own sports.\nNot bad for a country of less than 4 million people, that got its independence 30 years ago, eh? Hell, even my niece's boyfriend is the current world champion in team air rifle shooting at 10 meters lmao. Cry me a salty river, you butthole."
