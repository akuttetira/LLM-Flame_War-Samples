    "text": "You said they were relevant from what they did 100 years ago. Now they’re a “big team” for coming in 4th 12 years ago?\n\nLast 8 World Cups they didn’t qualify 3 times, twice they didn’t get out of the group stage, other three times they got to knock outs, they got 4th once. Not a “big team”. They’re fringe mediocre and with Suárez and Cavani retiring, they go into another slump for 10-20 years. Valverde is the exception but he can’t carry the team, especially in his position."
