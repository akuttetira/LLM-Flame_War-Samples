It states that we discriminated against the Spaniards (during our independence war 200 fucking hundreds years ago) by calling them \"godos\". Or that we are antisemitic, being that we have the world's largest jew population after Israel and the United States. Yes, there was a bombing of AMIA here, but planned and executed by Iran. That makes us antisemitic? WTF"
