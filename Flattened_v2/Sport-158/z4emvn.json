Like my other comment said it was replying to someone who was so surprised that Australia was part of FIFA Asia, which isn't a surprise to Australians (such as myself) considering our very close proximity and relationship with South East Asia in particular. Jesus Christ Reddit is exhausting."

You can swim to Indonesia\n\nThat comment proves to me, you don't have a clue that Australia is it's own continent. Just Give me your addresse and I will have an overnight delivery of world geography book shipped in your direction."

One is a continent, and the other is a ... you you get the point.\n\nSo when you write your comment, you have to distinguish the two, and in your context you should have written AFC instead of Asia, because otherwise the comment does not make sense and is just plain wrong.\n\n\nI feel bad for you, that in your native tongue, you struggle to communicate properly."
