Sure, 2 sports evolved from the same sport simply referred to as Football, but one of these has a much better association to the name than the other, especially if you compare to Handball and Basketball.\n\nTherefore, this shouldn't be a debate. There is only one true name for this sport, and it's high time people accepted it. Then again, some countries drive on the left, while others refuse the Metric system, so there will always be rebels trying to point out otherwise, but they are quite simply wrong."

I live in a word big enough for bangers and sausages, lifts and elevators, lorries and trucks. I'm sorry your world isn't big enough for linguistic diversity within the English-speaking world.\n\n\"There is only one true name for this sport\" ... you sound like a religious zealot. Unassailable fact: there is more than one name for this sport. The term \"soccer\" is much less common in most places, but very common in other places. \"It's high time people accepted it.\"\n\nThis is not nearly as big a deal as the metric system. It would actually be better (to avoid errors, for one reason) for non-metric countries to gradually shift. But \"football\" vs \"soccer\" is just one of countless examples of variations in vocabulary that truly do not matter at all."

My own native language is spoken by less than a million people, and we also call it \"football\" (translated of course, \"fótbolti/knattspyrna\" latter being literally \"sphere-kick\" so almost the same).\n\nWhat's up with the attacks based on pure assumptions anyway? I do realize I come off as quite the zealot, but the officiating body of this sport is called FIFA, Fédération Internationale de Football Association *in French* or International Federation of Association Football *in English.* As someone mentioned, even American teams have the suffix \"F.C.\" which stands for \"Football Club\"."

Neither English nor the US is in any minority as a language, and I actually fully support languages that are spoken by few, as I said I belong to such a group myself.\n\nOur difference of opinion stems from the fact that I think there needs to be an established lingua franca term for the sport on the internet, and other international places. It's to avoid confusion. My point was that most of the world calls the sport as football in their own language, as you can see here.\n\nIf Americans in the US want to call it soccer when seeing Charlotte FC, that's fine. But trying to establish it as a lingua franca for the rest of the world isn't, as they are in a minority there, hence my majority/minority argument.\n\nI know I'm defending this hill way too much, but to me it's a matter of avoiding confusion. If I started calling the sport *assoc*, wouldn't it be unnecessarily confusing? Yet, it's an established word for the sport, and according to your argument, that would be perfectly fine. I personally think it would complicate things."

By that time, the US already had another game that they had dubbed \"football\", so they kept calling it soccer.\n\nWhat's to be done at this point? Everyone in the world knows what soccer means, but some arbitrarily decided that it's no longer a valid term."

You may find it strange to suffest that, but it's just as strange to suggest soccer as an infernational term."

I realize we're all speaking in English here, but in an international community. Why not call American Football handegg to avoid confusion? Surely everyone knows what it refers to, at least everyone on this sub.\n\nAnd yes, I know it's ridiculous to suggest American Football should be called handegg everywhere, but it's equally ridiculous to suggest that soccer is the international term for football."

Also I'd love to meet someone on the internet who doesn't know what I mean when I say soccer.\n\nAs far as calling it football when speaking in an international context... The prevalence of American football is growing very rapidly in Europe. There are millions of fans and counting.\n\nIt's unfortunate that the two words/sports have collided like this, but changing what we call either sport would be a source of confusion for one side or another. As it stands now, calling it soccer is only a slight annoyance and avoids any confusion."

    "text": "I can't speak for the British, and frankly I don't think it matters if they used to sometimes call it soccer or not. It's irrelevant. I would argue that calling it football is only a slight annoyance to the few people (in an international capacity) that would confuse it with American Football.\n\nThe world cup is estimated to have 227 million people tune in **every day**, which is more people than watch the super bowl. Even if American Football is growing, it's still miles off from the viewership of Association Football, and the people that are used to refer to it as football. Therefore, I doubt many people outside the US and Canada are confused by the term."
