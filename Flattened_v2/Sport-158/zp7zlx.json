He's happy, and there's nothing wrong about it, maybe you can use that knowledge about class and good to solve real problems like sure you have in your country instead of trying to be a moral lord behind the keyboard. What the fuck do you know about the things all the players go trough to win the trophy? and first of all who the fuck are you to try to set rules to anyone?"

Why don't you respect other cultures and our ways to celebrate instead of impose your own terms of celebration.\n\n\"Desperately rationalizing childish behavior and exhibiting it\". I'm having fun on all the comments, and obviously i'm gonna rationalize something that is pure happiness. If you have a bias of prejudice and ignorance it's your problem, the whole thing is ridiculous like you said and shouldn't be a problem for anyone with REAL PROBLEMS in life. Just smile and keep your own life man, stop hating on anonymous people and players who doesn't care about your life\n\nThat being said +1 for the low effort trolling, i really enjoy reading your comments jaja"
