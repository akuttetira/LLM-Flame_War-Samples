    "text": "I didn’t insult you and would appreciate the same courtesy, since ironically you’re the one complaining about people shit talking others gratuitously.\n\nI understood what you said and still disagree. There were countless people from Europe and North America here crying that Brazilian players dancing after scoring was “disrespectul” (something that has happened every WC and no one has ever found an issue with it until now), using terms like “South American pantomime”, saying the team is “not great” because our last Cups were in 1994 and 2002 despite being the literal favorites and even justifying/downplaying racism against Brazilians and Brazilian players.\n\nWhere were you when those comments were made? Or do you just think these don’t count as “going out of one’s way to shit talk others” even though all of these were fully unprovoked?"
