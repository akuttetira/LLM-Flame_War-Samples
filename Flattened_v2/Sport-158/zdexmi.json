The war literally started because Serbia was pissed that all the other member states wanted to legally separate from Yugoslavia, and why would they want that in the first place if they had it so good? And now, after the war, Slovenia and Croatia are decades ahead of Serbia, although Serbia used to be more developed than both of them. Almost like Serbia was sucking their economy, and now it isn't doing that anymore. Hmmm..."

    "author": "VisualLiterature7545",
    "text": "So your point is that Serbia was \"sucking the economy of Croatia and Slovenia\"? Meanwhile most established industries post 1945 had already been established in Serbia proper then relocated to other states, including Croatia and Slovenia. This is evident in Yugoslavia's [Relocation of Serbian industry during the Informbiro period](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relocation_of_Serbian_industry_during_the_Informbiro_period).\n\nBtw, to argue that Croatia and Slovenia are decades ahead economically to Serbia is a bit of an overstatement. Sure you have an established seaside that caters to tourism, other than that there really isn't all that much in natural resources when compared to Serbia. You're in the EU so there are economic perks that come with that, that's about it. If Serbia had its corruption in check, we wouldn't be really comparing economies.\n\nNot trying to make this out to be a dick measuring contest, just sharing my opinion on the topic."

Meanwhile Croatia had a lot of big ones, including Končar, Bagat, INA, Jugotanker, multiple shipyards that exported transport ships worldwide just to name a few. Even with the economic stagnation and destruction of war, Croatia is ahead of Serbia by a lot. Slovenia even more."

In fact, Croatia is BETTER than Serbia so idk why your dumbass would say \"its just the Serbian team\".\n\nSecond of all, former Yugoslavia still contains smaller states that would easily add to the talent pool. Did you know the reason Italy isn't in this cup is because they lost to North Macedonia, a former Yugoslavian state? All of Yugoslavias talent in one would easily be a top 10-15 team\n\n\n\n\nI know this is hard for someone like you to accept (not very intelligent but huge American ego), but you're just wrong.

They're talking about current teams not historic potential you dumbass.\n\n\n\n\nAlso you do not know what a strawman is.

They just weren't in form.\n\nI get it though, there are many in this subreddit who just started watching the tournament and have absolutely no idea who 95% of players are or how the teams got to where they did. Serbia was on the radar of many sports analyst who were probably just as stunned that they perform so bad, just as stunned as the average Serb is. They finished first in qualifiers above Portugal and that was an indicator of their success.. which sadly never came.\n\nI agree though, their performance was a disgrace at this World Cup, yet again.\n\nMark my words, they'll perform well at the upcoming Euro."

Look up who were considered to be the best players while the country was united."
