So he can cry and sulk all he wants while the rest of the world rejoices. Great riddance."

As for the handball and other of his fouls, he was penalized and even _banned_ for them. Not like Maradona, or the serial cheater Sergio Ramos. It's ok to not like Suarez, but the hatred surrounding him is absolutely pathetic."

His unsportsmanlike behavior is also seen in other instances, such as his disgusting \"save\" against Ghana und subsequent crying-turned-celebration when they missed the penalty.\nHow about we stop babying these people who get paid millions per year."
