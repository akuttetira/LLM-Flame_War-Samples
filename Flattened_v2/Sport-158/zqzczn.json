    "text": "220 billion on infrastructure that will hardly, if ever, get used? There’s no profit, just waste of resources that mankind could’ve used for something else.\n\nAs for your resistance to LGBT, it sadly says a lot about you and people like you. Imagine if blonde Germans were to lash out against Mosques being built in their country and use your rhetoric against people different from them.\n\nYou live in 2022 not the 5th century. Religion has lied to you and everyone else, time to move on."

    "text": "The Twitter parallel is another case of cringe whataboutery. I’ve criticised that on separate occasions, but it’s incomparable to the slave labour abuses surrounding the Qatar infrastructure build.\n\nNo one should have to hide behind closed doors for fear of retribution. Your religion isn’t an excuse if you pretend you’re part of the civilised world."
