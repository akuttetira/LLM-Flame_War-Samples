They have been rather shit the whole 3 matches imo, there is lots thats wrong with that national team, especially in defence. Nations League also speaks for itself."

    "text": "Can we talk about offsides for a minute? This rule needs to change a little bit. Can it just be the feet only? Why is it if someone’s finger is 1mm further than the defensive player it’s offside meanwhile their feet are way behind? Just seems weird the amount of goals that have been called back because of how stingy this rule was, if the players body was twisted slightly different, I would be onside and they still would have go the goal regardless. Maybe it’s the Canadian in me but in hockey it’s based on your feet, it just makes sense because that’s the advantage your getting from being ahead of them…"

I think it is just parts of the body that can be used to legally contact the ball…\nBut I agree with you, it feels as though VAR has changed things and maybe the rules need to adapt to a world in which reviews exist… maybe they just add two more assistant referees so you’ve got linesmen on both sides of the whole field and they make the call live with no review…\nIt is such a great game and so much of it is the split second moments that end with a ball in the back of the net. The more that the officials take that excitement, place it under doubt and then relinquish goals, the more frustrating it is to be a fan."
