Why do you feel inclined to shit all over that?\n\nAnyway, I doubt that Maradona will be playing football in heaven, he will be balls deep in cocaine."

I don’t believe any sort of magical sky daddy exists at all so how can I think they are dumb? That would be an acknowledgment of their existence.\nAnd how does me making a comment stop anyone else believing? You’re confusing someone else’s right to believe in whatever nonsense they want with my right to pass comment."
