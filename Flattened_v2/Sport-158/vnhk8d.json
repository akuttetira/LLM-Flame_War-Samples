    "text": "I see a lot of people questioning Real Madrid's young midfield lacking \"creativity\". However, I think Camavinga possesses the technical abilities to make all the passes, and I think he has shown flashes of play making abilities. As with Vinicius Jr., I think we should let Camavinga develop before we write him off as a replacement option for Modrić or Kroos."

    "text": "oh please, when KDB first sprung out in Chelsea, 21 years old of age in 2011, people already labelled him as \"creative midfielder\"\n\nOr, remember what happen with Laurent Blanc trying to limit the black and Arab players?\n\nfootball still have problems of many people, professionals included, assuming people of color to be different based solely on race, Black were assumed to be physically stronger, Asians got labeled as hardworking, and Spanish got stereotyped into small player, but great with passing (thanks to Barcelona).\n\nI agree these players are still young and developing, but to say they're not creative is a stereotypical statement. If they are still young and developing, how could you know they are not creative? Your statement seems to be based solely on the fact that they play less (in case of Camavinga and Valverde)\n\nAlso creative players comes in many different forms, some are good with finding opening with passes, others do it with flair and dribbles, others control the flow of the team from the midfield. How do you know that a smart decision to cut off opponent's flow by cutting off passes are not signs of creativeness? How about Valverde's good game reading that makes him always be at the correct place and time to do both, running towards opponent's weak side, and closing off opponent's attack when defending, aren't these also shows a good creativeness?\n\n\nHell what about Camavinga's pass to Benzema above?"

    "text": "KDB was a far more attacking midfielder than any of our young midfielders when he started at genk and chelsea of course he'd be labeled more creative. When I say creative I mean passing ability, not ball progression that valverde and camavinga both excel at.\n\nCamavinga is a box to box midfielder, the only reason anybody is saying otherwise is because we've now spent 100M on another robust midfielder. When I think of creative young midfielders, i think of players like pedri and foden. You are correct camavinga has shown glimpses of creativity, and flair, however having seen him at Rennes, and now at madrid it's clear to me those aren't where his strengths lie. He's a ball carrier like valverde. That doesn't mean he cant improve or become that creative force. Casemiro wasn't an out an out DM at Porto, and look at him now.\n\nYou mentioned KDB as an example of a white dude who was labelled \"creative\" when he was coming up, but what about pogba, or tielemans, or sambi lokonga? None of these guys are white but most people see them as deep lying playmakers."

    "text": "Not the number in itself, the ratio of players being called creative, compared to other qualities. Whites gets more \"creative\" players compared to itself, while Black players \"produced\" more \"strong\" players. In common words, it is more common to find White \"creative\" players from a pool of White players, compared to Black \"creative\" player from a pool of Black players.\n\nAnd this becomes stereotypical because if you try to find \"strong\" players in White pool, you'll probably have a good chance of finding ones, meaning Whites aren't being stereotype as strong. But if you try to find \"creative\" players in Black pool, you'll ended up with only a handful, compared to say \"strong\" players."
