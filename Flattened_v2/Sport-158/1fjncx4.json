There’s zero risk/reward so why bother? Teams will either put out weakened sides or just half arse it and that’s what will happen here."

Just to put that into perspective: That's roughly what the clubs get if they win the austrian league. The whole fkin league, and they can earn as much on a single evening, up to eight times. It will be similarly important for all other small clubs, smaller leagues or clubs who are on a run like Atalanta, Girona or Leverkusen.\n\nMost of the teams will always be motivated to give their best, because it can make a 16 million euro difference on their bankroll, out of which parts will make it to the players in form of bonuses.\n\nI'm not sure how the table will develop, but there should still be attractive football being played up until the last day."

    "text": "I don't see where you are coming from. We need to make a distinction: Actual fans will still watch and follow their teams. It doesn't matter where they are positioned in the table, they will still support their team no matter what. Best examples for this are teams like Union Berlin last season.\n\nThen you have casual fans, who only care about good and decisive games. While the amount of games that will be interesting for those will definitely decrease towards the end of the groupstage.. it will never drop to 0. There are more than 8 good teams who want to fight for the top 8 spots.\n\nSo I don't really know where you are coming from. Of course the median experience will \"decrease\", simply because you have more games now, but that doesn't mean that the peak level changes.\n\nPeople *will* be interested in seeing who will top the table, and that team will have a strong character arc which will pull even more viewers into the knock-out stages. Imagine the marketing you can do around a team that beats everyone, or in an even better case wins all games/remains unbeaten throughout the league stage and is being hunted now by the rest of europe.\n\nImo you're focusing way too much on the bottom end, but that's not where this competition takes place."

If you perform well in the CL, then the chances are high you can get a good move. Best example is Kopenhagen after their run in the previous season. [They generated more revenue with sales than ever before.](https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/fc-kopenhagen/alletransfers/verein/190)\n\nTaking into account that player careers are short and this might be your only chance to shine on a big stage for years, then there isn't much that's supporting your point. Players are training day in day out, just to live their dream and you expect them to not give a fuck and leave that opportunity to level up their career on a silver plate? Sure.."

This greater chance to progress dilutes the number of games that count. It's been a widely publicised criticism of the new format.\n\nA huge number of teams between places 9 and 24 will have minimal reason to compete if their chance to progress (via playoffs be they seeded or unseeded) is safe and the majority of the teams placed 25-36 will also have little to reason to care if they are too far out of reach of playoffs.

Only several clubs can get consistently good results. The window of having a better result for any team in any match is much higher.\n\nI would say the spots in between 5-8 are pretty much undecided."

In the current format big teams often play their backups the final 1-2 games too.\n\nOf course real life is not a computer game, but at least just from a numbers standpoint, getting top 8 is harder than it might seem at first."
