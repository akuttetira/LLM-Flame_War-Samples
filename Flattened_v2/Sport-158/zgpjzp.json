Then what was the point of her going to the police to begin with if she wasn't going to tell them? Either way she would've broken their agreement, so why didn't she just tell them?\n\nShady to say the least. You don't even read your own sources"

    "text": "Lol nobody admitted consensual sex. They had sex, there are talks about a filed claim. There are photos of them hanging out in a bar flirting.\n\nChick decided to file a claim asking for money.  If claims about paying up are true it was when Ronaldo had just signed with the biggest team back then and the best thing was to get this off his back otherwise ''rape'' claim cases can go on for years and basically ruin his reputation and chance to get big. Even if he wins the case with easy, it would be too late for anything.\n\nMuricans redditors though as usual ride of drama and build up narratives to demonise people where it was obvious what the case is - Leeches trying to rob some rich and famous guy by trying to blackmail him.  The neverending story basically to get easy money.\n\nToo bad there are too many white knights who support female blackmailers and label anyone they don't like as ''rapist'' ''racist'' ''mysoginist'' or some other fabricated American excuse to trash on people."
