Consider that we've been under Russian occupation for 50 years only 30 years prior, and we're doing quite well, yet Saudi Arabia is still an authoritarian shithole under a piece of shit monarchy."

In the Syrian refugees case, Syrians who were already in Saudi were allowed to bring in their families and would get free healthcare and education, including enrollments in Saudi colleges. But yeah since we don't have a refugee system, they don't count obviously."
