    "text": "Important to note that Americans don't actually give a shit what people call the sport. It's mostly European folks with an inferiority complex. The key difference is that Americans are just trolling for a reaction.\n\nLots of Europeans seem to get offended that Americans don't revere the sport, so they misinterpret \"soccer\" as being an intentionally demeaning word.\n\nA lot of countries like the sport and call it soccer, Canadians and Australians, for example.\n\nEdit: keep downvoting. There have been literal books written about this. It has always been the other way around. People who call it soccer aren't the ones correcting people IRL. This is a joke response to troll butthurt Europeans. https://youtu.be/Ld5pfFrPBVE"

Wanna talk about inferiority complex yet you lot can never take a joke. Sorry you cant handle a little banter my friend, good luck in 4 years."

I never hear this shit unless it's a European randomly correcting me IRL. We do not give a shit what people call it. Only you guys get butthurt and pause conversations to moan. This top tier trolling from the Americans is just a response to years of being awkwardly corrected by seething insecure Europeans for no reason.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Ld5pfFrPBVE"

Also might wanna create your statement, “always has been always will be” since it started as association football, soccer just being a slang term"
