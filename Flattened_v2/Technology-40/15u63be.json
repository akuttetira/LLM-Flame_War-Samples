    "text": "Horror games don't sell nearly as well as investors would like. Dead Space 1 was fantastic and they sold so poorly that dead space 2 was made to be more of an action game with horror elements. That game is still better than most games that have released in the last ten years but the sales were still not there so Dead Space 3 was turned into a Gears of War game. Then all of the developers ended up on Call of Duty and Battlefield games.\n\nAlien Isolation is a fantastic game that sold so poorly that they shutdown the studio.\n\nResident's Evil's Pivot to action for RE4 was a massive hit and influenced games like Dead Space and Gears of war.\n\nThese investors are trying to make hundreds of millions dollars. If they just wanted millions they would invest in real estate instead of investing in a smaller game."

    "text": "But that's always been the case for Horror games though, it's always been niche. The problem with these pivots these companies started doing is that they proceed to turn horror franchises into action instead, even when it was unnecessary to do so.\n\nYou'd think Capcom would finally learn that after seeing the reaction people had towards 5 & 6 when they finally made RE7, only to return to that cycle halfway through Village when it suddenly becomes CoD zombies."

To them, that's nothing. Why wait years for a few million when you could have gotten that sooner by investing in something else? When they invest in a game that takes 4 years to pay off they want a big pay day.\n\nCapcom will forever chase the success of RE4 because that's THE resident evil hit, and it's and action game.\n\nIt was so successful that Dead Space, Gears, The Last of Us and many other have been chasing that success as well"

Another reason for such a big team is because he went for scale of videos rather than quality. It was the low hanging fruit and a conscious decision.\n\n3. He has an extensive line of products which dwarfs mkbhd and he has a 3 or sometimes 4 hour podcast which at this point of time is just a vehicle to move his merch rather than anything else.\n\nAbove 3 points compensate for the fact that he has a big team many times over. He does not have to be over aggressive in selling his stuff with his 25+ videos per week to maintain his team.\n\nHere’s the bottomline in my opinion:\n\nMkbhd makes videos because he loves making videos. Same with people like Mark Rober and others.\nLinus makes videos because he loves making money."

Iirc, floatplane operated at a loss until fairly recently.\n\n>Another reason for such a big team is because he went for scale of videos rather than quality. It was the low hanging fruit and a conscious decision.\n\nYea not arguing against that, just saying that with wanting to scale that fast comes increased costs. They spent like a million+ on labs and a team for it.\n\n>He has an extensive line of products which dwarfs mkbhd and he has a 3 or sometimes 4 hour podcast which at this point of time is just a vehicle to move his merch rather than anything else.\n\nI don't watch much of the podcast tbh but I think that's related. There's more of a pinch when you're in such a fickle industry & fortunes can change so quickly (as this debacle has shown)\n\nHe might not have to be that aggresive in selling merch but we're both just speculating without knowing their costs/etc. Could be they just have a few months of runway, could have years.\n\n>Mkbhd makes videos because he loves making videos. Same with people like Mark Rober and others. Linus makes videos because he loves making money.\n\nCan't say I really disagree here. Speculating again but maybe his attitude change is cuz like you said, he just doesn't care for the content anymore. It's clear he was super passionate about it in the early to mid days of the channel."

There's a reason even the largest tech companies like google, meta and twitter have had massive layoffs. The workers don't print money just by sitting at a desk in their office"

    "text": "do what exactly? if you are talking about fixing the situation.\n\n1.not make a shitty apology video that dances around the issues and instead give a strait to the point video explaining the issues at hand and how they plan to address them.\n\n2.change the employee contracts as to remove the bullshit \"you cant talk to your co workers about pay\" thing because that only exists to allow management to get away with pay discrimination.\n\n3. actually go on a break for a week (or however long it takes to complete this list) as the company implements the mentioned changes to correct past errors.\n\n4. pause all subscription payments for the month that the week break occurs its not fair to charge people for nothing in return.\n\n5. Open a 3rd party investigation into workplace harassment and discrimination and immediately terminate anyone involved in said harassment and discrimination that being either doing it, willingly allowing it to continue or attempting to hide it.\n\n6. find the victims of said harassment and discrimination and compensate them ALOT.\n\n7. (getting into fixing the LMG image) release the finding of the investigation mention above with sensitive information redacted announce how the company has delt with the people involved.\n\n8. Once thats all cleaned up THE AND ONLY THEN should they start working on videos again (they should have the money to keep paying people during this down time and if not they shouldn't be in business anyway imo)\n\n9. Give full access to any piers who want to come and check you have cleaned house and allow them to make sure the company has actually fixed everything.\n\n10. Go back to focusing on videos and products.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe company would take a huge hit in the short term (again if they dont have the money for a rainey day why the fuck are they valued at over 100 mill or whatever) but in the long term not only would you save if nor build a stronger appearance but having cleaned house of the rot should allow you to build back better. And if its found out that the issues are coming from the previous head well tough shit their out of here."

    "text": "Out Of Touch is the spot-on theme here.\n\nIn my own long-winded thoughts, I more so think it comes from a place of a sort of “entitled bubble” culture built after years of success where ego and main character syndrome kicks in, where they spend so much time and effort being what they think is “right” that now, they must always be “right” to some degree about everything they do. They spend so much time making perfect scripts with the perfect amount of jokes and perfect amount of snarkiness that flow throughout their whole video, that it builds a false sense of: “we always work so hard not to be out of touch, so how can we ever be so wrong or out of touch about something.”\n\nThey think everyone is rooting for them in their mind, all eyes on them, telling themselves they have room to be “personable” because things ARE serious but *aren’t that serious* so they’ll absolutely address problems they have, but they think they can’t or don’t ever do major harm to people, because they work so hard at being “right.” So it’ll be solved if they just make a video about it. Out of touch.\n\nThat’s my two cents since I have a personal relationship with a former best friend of 14 years who I cut out of my life. He was a top LTT fan and I realized he took a lot of personality traits from Linus into his own daily life. Always explaining details and saying “this is the right way” and “why would you ever spend money on this when it’s just bad.” Saw the same toxicity and left him."
