It’s unnecessarily wasteful. Linus complains about tech waste and e-waste and in a domain he controls is doing something responsible that’s a little bit more work.\n\nBut more importantly, had they dropped the hardcore apology video, then got hit with the SA  / hostile workplace public accusations…\n\nThere couldn’t be a second apology video that’s  even more sincere. It’s all pretty shit but having this apology video be on-brand with their shtick actually works in their favor a lot IMO. It will allow them to make a distinction between money and morality."

Had this Billet Labs thing occurred without the piling on of a disgruntled employee talking about Sexual Assault, self-harm, promises unkept, hostile work environment…\n\nThe apology video might be a little cringey but otherwise completely fine. The humor is just their humor. Getting on their proverbial knees to beg for their audience forgiveness over a dispute with a single vendor is melodramatic and outside of “celebrity drama” or in this case “YouTube drama” no business and vendor would ever have this dispute be handled liked this.\n\nSo to do that would come off as fake and insincere. I think it was also an inflection point.\n\nLinus hired a CEO because he’s over managing everything and too much was already slipping through the cracks. His creators also seem over worked and the quality of videos has slipped. So using this drama as a turning point while also announcing a hiatus was objectively good.\n\nThe big turn is Madison’s post. It makes the apology video into a funhouse mirror. Everything it was trying to do is distorted and gross.\n\nNow they’re a bit stuck. Releasing yet another apology video (back to back) would definitely come off badly. Plus they have to actually find the truth and potentially fire several people.\n\nI wouldn’t speak to my audience on video (that will be picked apart) until everything has basically been resolved."

They seem to be untouchable with an intense fan base and then they or their company does something terrible and it implodes about 2/3rds of their hood will and all that’s left is the rabid super fans.\n\nIm hoping things work out differently this time and that they honestly spend some time looking inwards and making some major systemic changes but from what I’ve seen here I think enough people will defend them long enough that they try to wait out the majority of the storm and go back to mostly business as usual. I hope Im wrong but as someone who isn’t invested in the channel I really don’t see that happening based on how they’ve been approaching this and other scandals."

They are already being held accountable by those who had valid complaints to make - whether it was about their data, about their mistakes with another company, or a toxic workplace.

From a pinned comment in the video itself telling people that it's fine and to not harass the guy, to a message in the description, to just re-editing or deleting the video altogether.\n\nUnfortunately, everyone watching the video from the time of its release to today sees the exact same video that triggered fans to go on a harassment spree.

As an older but still relatively recent example in the grand scheme of things, in 2008/2009 there was a bunch of drama (outside of reddit) in DotA about pros cheating.

They already lost money on subs to Youtube and Floatplane publicly but taking a week off from making videos to fix things is a very good step. It also sounds like they are putting guard rails on Linus so he doesn’t make things unnecessarily worse than he should, love to see this. As for the Billet Labs situation, they fucked up and they own it, Colton explained his mistake and why the situation got worse. They shouldn’t have auctioned the block off but they did realize the mistake and took steps to fix it, I can’t fault them for actively trying to fix it even if the employee didn’t check who the email went to."

In fact, LMG needs to bring in a real crisis management consultant in addition to the outside investigator in order to get a handle on things. The jokes during the apology video were a little jarring. Linus still being defensive before actually apologizing wasn't good crisis management and took away a lot of the good points that Terran and the rest of the leadership team made. Linus is still the face of the company and his name is on the door. I'm glad the video began and ended with Terran, but the company culture is all about Linus, whether Linus likes it or not.

That email silently failed due to user error (omission of recipient address), and Colton provided proof (as much as screenshots are proof) for this. The dilemma is that from BilletLab's perspective LMG never reached out, but from the LMG perspective they did reach out. To be clear, the blame still lies with LMG, but the ill intent, that was a large part of the accusation of malice levied against LMG, turned out to be a \"simple\" misunderstanding.\n\nIronically, if GN had reached out to LMG with Billet Lab's side of the story, then the failed email and subsequently the misunderstanding would have likely resolved sooner and more amicably. Not saying at all that Steve has a responsibility whatsoever to help LMG resolve such matters, but it would have certainly helped to hear out the LMG side, of this two-sided story."
