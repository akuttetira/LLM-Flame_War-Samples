    "text": "Down voting his comments on that AMA is the last thing I will ever look forward to on reddit. Such a shame. It's been a fun run, r/place, small communities, the memes, the discussions. But without the third party apps the site is significantly worse off. And even more concerning is the clear direction the site/company is heading towards.\n\nThey never intended to negotiate, they intended to eliminate the 3rd party apps all along. And they mean to do that so that they can consolidate their harvesting of user data.  Same as any other social media website that has been ruined.\n\nIt's just so sad and depressing seeing everything (and I mean damn near *everything*) get worse instead of better.\n\nEDIT to add: I love social media. Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, reddit...they all are amazing ideas at their core and all have the potential to be fantastic user products. But this profit driven impulse to harvest data, spy, and psychologically manipulate their users ruins everything. Facebook is now a shell of what it once was, and of it's true potential. There are other ways of generating profit or revenue that are not so dystopian, yet we sit back and allow things to continue to get worse. We need better laws and regulations on targeted advertising, on user data harvesting, and on user manipulation."

Among other things, we're looking at average per-player credit earn rates on a daily basis, and we'll be making constant adjustments to ensure that players have invasive advertisements that are compelling, rewarding, and of course attainable via gameplay.\n\nWe appreciate the candid feedback, and the passion the community has put forth around the current topics here on Reddit, our forums and across numerous social media outlets.\n\nOur team will continue to make changes and monitor community feedback and update everyone as soon and as often as we can. And go fuck yourself you piece of shit."

Why is Reddit attacking the 3rd party apps when the real meat and potatoes money is with the LLMs that they can charge heavy enterprise pricing with.\n\nWith realistic model and runway for big third party apps like Apollo, give him a 16 month notice to adapt and you would probably get a fair number like $7 million/yr. That is still a pretty big deal number.\n\nThis is just not how business is done."
