Anyone saying that has no idea about the history of the word and isn't helping anyone. Instead, the use of it continues to be incredibly damaging no matter who does it. You telling me it's messed up to tell people not to use racial slurs is the exact reason why real justice and equality is still centuries away.\n\nHere just a few quotes to reinforce my point. I hope you think about them next time before saying something like that again:\n\n>\"If people knew the true meaning of that word, its roots and how it was used,\" said Larry Watson, professor of sociology and music at Boston College. \"Anyone who knew the story of Emmett Till,\" he said, referring to the 14-year-old black teen who was lynched in Mississippi for whistling at a white woman and whose killing helped ignite the civil rights movement, \"would never use that word. It was used when white slave owners were caught having sex with their female slaves and they would be charged with bestiality because they considered black women animals, less than human. ... If everyone knew this, I don't see how anybody could use that word.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"The hip-hop generation has never been denied a seat on the bus, service in a restaurant or a job because of their skin color as a matter of policy or law. Many children of hip-hop have never been repeatedly called the \"er\" version of the N-word and may be more familiar with the \"friendly\" use of the word than its historical legacy.\"\n>\n>\"They have no historical reference on which to base the meaning behind the word,\" said Mark Chapman, professor of African-American studies at Fordham University. \"I have a daughter, and she knows not to use the word and how I would feel and what would happen to her if she was ever caught using the word.\"\n>\n>\"There's definitely something to be argued about, the African-American community's tendency for self-destruction, and I've seen Chris Rock's routine -- that there's a difference between black people and niggers,\" Chapman said. \"But still, I think it perpetuates the use of the word. Why couldn't we just make up our own language? We've done that before with \\[the words\\] 'dawg' and 'homey.'\"\n>\n>\"Richard Pryor used the N-word all the time in his routines,\" said Chapman. \"Then he went to Africa and he said, 'I will never use that word again.' Imagine if we could get some of the rappers to go to Africa -- like Nelly, Ja Rule and Kanye West, one of the more enlightened of the bunch. Imagine what effect they could have if they visited Africa and came back and said, 'I won't use the N-word again.'\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"The use of the N-word is so far beyond the African-American community, they can't get it back,\" said Mark Naison, professor of African-American studies at Fordham University and author of \"Brooklyn White Boy: A Memoir.\" \"For Latinos living in the Bronx, 'nigga' is the same as 'my homeboy.' Who's going to be the language police to the Dominicans living in Washington Heights \\[in Manhattan\\], the University Heights section in the Bronx? And they share the same urban socioeconomic factors that African-Americans face every day. It \\[the N-word's use\\] has taken a life of its own. ... It's out of control.\""
