The ones that are shocking them now, after the GN video and her coming forward a 2nd time.\n\nJust putting it out there, i'm no CEO or HR manager.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: i guess people didn't understood for some reason, so i clarified it"

    "text": "An investigation tends to happen in private and without publication to the wider organisation so as to encourage continued reporting and prevent an uneven power dynamic.\n\nThe meeting in question does address the allegations, reminds people of their obligations and encourages reporting, either via usual channels or anonymously.\n\nNeither you, nor I are in a position to say whether these allegations were investigated at the time or even the quality of that investigation.\n\nWhat we can conclude from the Terren statement, the recording and other evidence is the company was aware, they reminded people of their obligations and are now investigating via a third party, with a commitment to make the outcomes open and transparent.\n\nWhat I do not anticipate is that the outcome will address these specific allegations or mention any particular employees, this is for the aforementioned reasons of privacy. What it will show however are any systemic failings, any actions which need to be taken, systems put in place to prevent further such issues and any disciplinary action which may take place as a result of the allegations being proven.\n\nI refer to your original statement of \"I'm no CEO or HR Manager\". You have no idea of the correct process, and have been very unclear in your communication around the information you sought. I hope I've been able to clear things up for you though."

If you do a meeting and denounce it publicly. Do you think only the bad guy got the public pressure/judgment.  It also goes to the victim. The victim can be shamed in their back etc..\n\n\nBecause NOT ALL PEOPLE ARE GOOD in nature, can you guarantee the 998 person is good and be supportive?\n\n\nNo, so sometimes things need to be handled privately"
