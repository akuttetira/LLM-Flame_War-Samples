Now that the committee has voted to move to a full vote with an even worse \"fixed\" version of the bill, I'd expect opposition to ramp up considerably. Even very large companies cannot hope to contend with regulations from 50 different states, especially given that it won't help stop child exploitation anyway.\n\nThere are many ways for it to die: it doesn't get brought up for a vote, it gets brought up for a vote but gets referred to committee again to die quietly, it goes up for a vote and is amended into oblivion, it gets passed and the president vetoes it, it becomes law but is such a terrible mistake it gets repealed (with each side blaming the other for it not working), or it dies in the courts.\n\nBut it will die, because it would make the legal and financial costs of doing business too high"

But if you say that in any of the Sanders subreddits your post/comment will be removed and you might even get banned.\n\nThose subs are now full of—and partially controlled by—pro-Trump people masquerading as progressives.\n\nIf you’re really a Bernie supporter (like I am), voting for Biden is absolutely imperative. Bernie can still get a lot done working with a Democratic President and Congress; absolutely zero progressive policies will ever be considered if the Presidency and Congress are controlled by Republicans."

    "text": "The issue of copyright violation in the context of AI training is a complex and evolving area of law. It’s important to note that AI systems, like the ones used by Reddit and others, are often trained on large amounts of data from the internet, some of which may be copyrighted.\n\nThere have been discussions and lawsuits claiming that this practice violates copyright laws. The argument is that by scraping the web for images or text, AI systems might be using copyrighted work without crediting or rewarding the original creators. This is particularly contentious when the AI systems are capable of generating new content, potentially competing in the same market as the original works.\n\nHowever, it’s also argued that AI systems do not directly store the copyrighted material, but rather learn patterns from it. If an AI system were found to be reproducing copyrighted material exactly, that could potentially be a clear case of copyright infringement.\n\nAs of now, copyright law does not specifically address the issue of AI and machine learning, as these technologies did not exist when the laws were written. The U.S. Copyright Office has issued a policy statement clarifying their approach to the registration of works containing material generated by AI technology. According to this policy, AI-generated content does not meet the criterion of human authorship and is therefore ineligible for copyright protection.\n\nThis is a rapidly evolving field, and the intersection of AI and copyright law will likely continue to be a topic of legal debate and legislative development. It’s important to stay informed about the latest developments in this area. Please consult with a legal professional for advice specific to your situation.\n\n\nBut for the A.I. makers, it’s time to pay up.\n\n“Crawling Reddit, generating value and not returning any of that value to our users is something we have a problem with,” Mr. Huffman said. “It’s a good time for us to tighten things up.”\n\n“We think that’s fair,” he added."

Messages are stored on your phone and only stored on the server for max. 30 days if your message is not getting received by the other party. As soon as the message is received the message is removed from the server. So chances are very slim for them to get your messages even with having your private key, unless all your messages were not received by the other party under 30 days."

Although if you implying that was PR statement then they have shitty engineering.  I highly doubt Facebook lacks resources when it comes to engineering and operations of their data processing."
