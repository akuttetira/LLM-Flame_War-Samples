They are completely unconcerned by this and likely remember how much outrage there was over Ellen Pao shutting down subs. At the very worst, they'd have to fire Spez and bring in someone else, which they're perfectly willing to do."

This is not even close to the first time Reddit admins have replaced mods or even entire mod teams.\n\n>Every decision about rules or guidelines of a sub will be met with backlash as it's no longer community run.\n\nSubreddits are not \"community run\" and never have been. Moderators are completely unelected and are selected at will by the existing moderators of the subreddit (or Reddit admins, in some cases).\n\n>Other social media platforms pay hundreds of millions per year to moderate.\n\nOther social media platforms don't have tens of thousands of willing volunteers to moderate and an extensive moderator toolbox making that extremely easy to do.\n\n>It requires staff, tooling, and procedures that will take at least a year to scale and it will be pure controversy after controversy in that time.\n\nReddit is currently moderated by volunteers using existing tools and procedures and has been since its creation. This is not controversial in any way whatsoever.

This \"protest\" was only possible because Reddit admins allowed it temporarily. Reddit has made it clear it will not allow this kind of cybersquatting in the future and will remove any mods who attempt it. [Here's a great thread of subreddits that are blacking out \"indefinitely\" if you want a laugh.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/148ks6u/indefinite_blackout_next_steps_polling_your/?sort=confidence)\n\n>Advertisers want stable, family friendly platforms with high consistent traffic. Look at YouTube, twitch, Twitter, Tumblr for examples\n\nReddit is just as stable and family friendly as any of those sites (and both those factors are entirely controlled by the site admins), but with a much larger percentage of people who are literally addicted to it. This \"protest\" was driven by a bunch of addicts who were afraid it would be more difficult for them to get their fix anywhere at any time. This has been an advertiser's wet dream."
