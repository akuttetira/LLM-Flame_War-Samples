Those who've never known the touch of a woman outside their mum, or the warmth of the sun on their face; nor the touch of grass beneath their feet.\n\nMaybe not suffering double digit IQ twat waffles is precisely why I am thriving and you, well, look at you, and your little group of 7 simpering cretins that seem to think -7 internet points means anything other than fuck all."
