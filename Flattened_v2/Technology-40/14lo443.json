It's laggy, buggy, bloated, and lacks a decent feature set. I have current flagship Android phone, which should provide plenty of horsepower for almost anything. The official app stutters when scrolling, has noticeable delays when opening images, lacks basic video and image controls..."

    "text": "I mean, you're in a Apple subreddit so I just assumed I guess. Android has always been wonky, ever since before Verizon got the iPhone and AT&T had the exclusive rights (I worked for Verizon for a number of years). When Android came out and I worked in cellular stores it was always a different model and manufacturer just loading the OS. I remember multiple high powered android phones being sold while the same OS was on a phone hundreds of dollars cheaper, same OS, but the actual hardware was completely different. It sucked and I had to sell them because we made $0 commission on iPhone sales at the time.\n\nI've only ever used it on iPhone, so I honestly can't speak for Android today, but the iPhone app has never done me dirty. I've abandoned countless apps for various reasons, but this was the way I used Reddit since moving from the browser on my phone.\n\nPeople will talk trash about my viewpoint on\nthis whole situation, but the fact is I'm old enough and involved enough to see the whole picture and so sometimes those experiences don't translate well to people that don't have those experiences.\n\nThe issues you speak of? I've had my iPhone 6 since release until 3 weeks ago when my wife made me get a new phone. That phone was nowhere near the power of even this iPhone 11, but it worked perfectly fine the entire time. Like all apps though there are limitations on some things you can do that require a\ncomputer to see, but that's pretty normal in my experience.\n\nWanting to destroy a platform for app issues on different devices is like giving 1 star reviews on a Steam game because your computer has problems running it. I might not be with the popular crowd here, but I do have reasons. I'm using the Reddit app now with no issues on my new phone. You use a flagship phone for Android and have issues, but my iPhone 6 never did. I just don't see the argument"

I've been keeping a list as I go and not a single user with a 10 year old account has done it. Chances are if people say they do they'll just create a new account, disassociate from a failed attempt at a protest, and continue to use Reddit as normal."
