    "text": "But the Problem isn’t the quality of the screwdriver…..\n\nLinus' argument for not retesting the product was the price of the product, he even admitted that he would have given them a bad review solely on the price alone. Which obviously is completely stupid…If we apply the same logic to his products, be it the screwdriver or the backpack are bad because of their price alone.\n\n$70 screwdriver? Bad product, my motherboard/case came with a free one.     $250 backpack? Bad product, I can get a backpack from Walmart for $10."

    "text": "I don't want to get into the argument because it implies that what Linus did becomes acceptable if the deal is \"bad\" enough and that's a relative term.\n\nBut since you brought it up, the price to performance ratio of the ltt screwdriver compared to its competition is way more valuable than the billet labs water block. You aren't going to get a similar functioning screw driver for $7-$14 (quality ratchet, bit storage, strong magnetic retention)\n\nYou can however find waterblocks for $100-$200 for a 3090ti that will perform basically the same as the billet labs one.\n\nBut again it's a shitty argument because it implies low value products deserve this treatment. The billet labs block never meant to be good value. Its the Bentley of the water blocks. Expensive and over kill for people they want that."

    "text": "Disclaimer, I got an LTT screwdriver as a present and absolutely love it, I use it daily and have been through hundreds of screwdrivers through the years, I also very rarely buy a cheap tool unless it's as a 1 time use product and even then for some tools like saws the quality of the cut means cheap for a 1 time cut isn't worth it.\n\nFor the GPU block I do find it hard to accept that it is worth buying unless you are mad. Even if you were a baller and happy to spend insane money you would invest in a 4090 to get more power than you would get with a 20 degree drop in temperature on a 3090ti.  It really is a product that doesn't have any point to it for quite a few reasons"

    "text": "Its just a bling thing. The water block is specifically for a specific market that enjoys buying overpriced none essential or functionally necessary things. And for that it works. Its like saying never buy a 2 million dollar lambo because a 200k sports car performs just as well if not better in some situations. some people just buy it for the bling and LTT should have recognized that, and have recognized that for many other intentionally overpriced products previously."

    "author": "NoCollar2690",
    "text": "The point of saying you have a 2 million dollar lambo aventador as apposed to a 200k lambo gallardo is that overall you have the best and it's recognisable bling.  With the waterblock in the admittedly piss poor review the recognisable part is that you have to pair it with the fact that you don't have the more recognisable and bling 4090."

    "text": "What you are talking about is now subjective. A friend ik likes to do stuff like this and is very interested in it after seeing the LTT drama. People like different things. Things obviously sold for bling factor shouldnt be judged on its price point because its price is its selling point. The most important information linus could have given for potential buyers are whether or not this performs well at all, rather than being worth the price because its in a specific market. People who are down to shell this kind of money for something interesting also want it to perform very well in addition to the bling, because buying something that looks good but performs like shit just isnt worth it for them."

    "text": "I'm sure if the company survives they will be able to map a lot of their prototype for the 3090ti to the 4090 and beyond.  They might even be able to sell adapter plates in the future allowing portability for the cooler.\n\nSome people also make builds centered around aesthetics."
  },
  {
    "author": "NoCollar2690",
    "text": "I agree with you that I am sure in the future they can expand on their range but the product he had at hand to review was for the 3090 and at the rate graphics cards come out they would need to be able to release practically on day 1 not to mention needing to support the different manufacturers boards etc meaning it is not really plausible not to mention that each generation of card outputs drastically more heat and the stock coolers on those cards will improve to keep the temps about the same meaning it will eat away more and more at the advantage of the block.\n\nAnd yes people do aesthetic builds but very very rarely at the cost of performance especially when it is internal aesthetics.\n\nDon't get me wrong I think they would probably sell a couple but anywhere near enough to make it profitable? I sincerely doubt it and I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone.\n\nDid he do it dirty by not testing it on the correct card with a massively overspecced radiator so it doesn't throw off the results by just taking a long time to reach thermal equilibrium because of the big chunk of copper and therefore not showing off it's true performance? Most definitely, was the video a pile of crap because of the low standards, also most definitely.\n\nbut is he wrong that you would have to be more than a little bit insane to pay 800 for just the waterblock and then on top all the stuff around it to cool a last gen piece of hardware, I really can't say he is."

But you've made a fair point and supported it well overall, so I can't say you're wrong.  Most importantly, we agree they've been done dirty, no matter what their prospects were otherwise."

It's been far more durable than any of the other ones I've had (yes I've dropped it on concrete multiple times, and fully in a tank of water - it's still going strong). I was doubtful on whether it could hold up to industrial use but  I've had it since release and it's exceeded my expectations. I would buy it again."
