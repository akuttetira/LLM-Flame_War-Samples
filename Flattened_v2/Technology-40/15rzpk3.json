Like you just have this event that everyone around you can relate to and then all of a sudden you look around and that collective memory starts to fade because so many more people just didn’t experience it first hand."

I work with a lot of CSV files that need to be sorted, often in other apps or just text editors, and YYYY/MM/DD is the best for that.  A standard sort on dd/mm/yyyy will give you nonsense."
