The best practice in a situation like this is to be supportive to the accuser, but not attack anyone. If the claims turn out to be true, then a shit storm will commence either way, but if they are false then the damage from pre-emptive reactions could career ending anyway.\n\nSee the Kwite allegations from less than 6 months ago, man was accused of a lot of stuff, but it turns out that Kwite was actually the victim and had years worth of chat logs to prove it. It still ruined his online career and mental health and he isn't even sure if he want's to do online content anymore and after 6 months he hasn't really uploaded anything but joke tweets. Accusations alone can be damaging, but that doesn't mean we should attack the accuser either. WAIT FOR PROOF!"

So all the shit he's brushed off with half arsed excuses or ignored, relying on a loyal fanbase, is now coming to light or coming back with a vengance.\n\nThe shit with Madison etc is utterly unacceptable in any workplace. Christ, the blatant disregard for fact, quality, and selling people's shit is too. They have always been the villain, the internet just didn't want to know.\n\nAnd now it does.\n\nAnd they're paying for it - and they're too dumb to realise this, at least so far. Can't just half arse a reply and hope fans have your back. Not any more. They had time to fix themselves and didn't, and this is what they get."
