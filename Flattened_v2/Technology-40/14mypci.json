    "text": "> Even Twitter has always had a first party app for most of its existence.\n\nWrong. Twitter went through the exact same growing pains. There were two massive 3rd party twitter apps that people loved, that have both since, shutdown.\n\nIve been on Reddit for 10 years. Probably used all the 3rd party apps at least once. The only 3rd party apps shutting down like this are Apollo and others not willing to modify the business model to account for having to spend money to use someone else’s API. That’s on those devs not Reddit."

    "text": "I said what I said. Twitter had a first party app close to launch. People were still drawn to third party apps which were eventually all shut down in one way or another.\n\nReddit on the other hand depended on these third party apps to grow.\n\nHaving a paid API was never the problem. It’s the timeline and pricing structure that is non-sensical. They reiterate for months that things will not change and then decide to make changes with 1 month notice. And then Reddit is spreading lies about individual developers. That’s just not a way to run a business that depends on a community of volunteers to function.\n\nThese kinds of decisions spell the beginning of the end for this platform but some folks are burying their heads in the sand while dumb leadership ruins something good. There’s way to have a paid API that brings Reddit revenue and keeps the minority of third party app users happy, but spez would rather go scorched earth with the whole concept, and disrupt the existing community to do it."
