They just saw a decent job.\n\nThere are also a lot of employees with decent cars, a house, a job they like, hobbies outside of work that cost a shitload(I for example follow an employee that builds custom keyboards, not a cheap hobby)\n\nIf I were you I would put down the pitchfork and look at the facts and not feelings"

We were talking about salaries.\n\nIf we pull open that can of worms. Within LTT there are multiple woman who worked there for longer in different positions (backoffice, camera work, presenter etc) most of them still work there and as far as I can tell do their jobs very well.
