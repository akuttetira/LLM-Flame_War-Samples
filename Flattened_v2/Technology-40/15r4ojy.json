They could very well release a waterblock in the future that actually would be a good value to average consumers, and there will be some people who just remember that one video and assume the company makes bad products. To me, that's the worst part in all this - as one of the biggest tech channels, they have a responsibility to fairly represent the products they are reviewing, and in this case they have shirked that responsibility at every possible opportunity."

But they should have done it anyway, or scrapped the entire video. It's never worth creating a BAD video. It hurts the brand.\n\n> Given it's weight, issues, etc. Yes, I'd call it (the controller) a waste of over $80,000.\n\nYou can, you would just be wrong though. It's an investment in gold, as they now have over 1.5 KG of it.

The point is, if a product isn't given a fair chance to be demonstrated on one of the biggest if not the biggest PC hardware based tech channel, people might come off of the video thinking the company itself doesn't make good products even if Linus chose the wrong GPU for it.

The humility in accepting that countless hours and tens of thousands of dollars of research and development are gone, to then go on to send a message to whomever may have it now that they wish them well with it is inspiring. Innovation is a nearly insurmountable mountain in getting a product to market and getting a company with the audience of LTT to review a design prototype must have felt like a huge milestone, only to receive a half-hearted attempt at a review and insulting coverage of the product; losing the product altogether afterwards isn't just insult to injury it really should be criminal, even if only negligently so."

Lets hope it bring on something good.\n\nI watched through the \"review video\" of your cooler and it was an interesting product that should have recieved proper respect and care which was completely lacking in that video. I hope you will let someone else test that product for a proper review. It's a fun unique product that could for sure be interesting to the most \"extreme\" of builders...

The evidence (albeit circumstantial) actually leans towards something sinister.\n\n1) GN's noted the conflicts of interest with Noctua and Asus.  Who's to say Noctua didn't like the competition?\n\n2) LTT having review TONS of products and even making some of their own should know that custom milling is expensive ESPECIALLY for a startup and would outweigh the cost of shipping by a large margin.\n\n3) Most companies would simply ask if they would like to be included in auctions ESPECIALLY with prototype IP.  Why didn't they ask Billet?  Even tossing it avoids a bunch of legal issues, avoiding unintentionally selling other people's property.\n\n4) One minute of Googling shows me their Reddit post which they mention tells me that their end goal (and a few commenters note even before they mention it) is making smaller form factor cases.    Why didn't LMG - which should be far more experienced than some random commenters - know this?  Did Billet not tell them?\n\n\nThere's a lot of questions that yes, you could say it was several innocent mistakes... But that's a LOT of mistakes in one review.\n\nThe funniest part is that regardless of the reason (malice or stupidity), it makes LMG either look stupid or be untrusted due to conflicts of interest."
