    "text": "I am a Muslim, but I am not going to come into with this from Islamic background, just logical background. First of all, I don't see anything wrong with sex in heaven. Everyone will be beautiful in Heaven according to Islam, and wife of this life will be better looking than the Houri's. Everyone in Heaven won't defecate or get sick btw.\n\nNow to the point, you are assuming people in Arabia are naive and will sign up for death because of a promise of women. Even though many of them rejected his message and called him crazy or thought of him as mentally ill. Many of them didn't believe in afterlife too. They were still conservative when it came to pre-marital relations, and they married several wives at the time, so they were not lacking when it came to sexual gratification. They were also desert tribal people who were not afraid of battle like you think that they needed a promise to convince them to fight and die. They fought and died before Islam as well.\n\nAnother thing is you need to understand concept of martyrdom in battle. It's based upon intention. Not just simply fight and die in battle with Muslims. And also understand there are many kinds of martyrs that don't involve dying in battle.\n\nThat is why in my opinion I can't make sense of this argument logically. Also what is obscene about it? They are your legal wives in Heaven, cannot be shared(no cheating), and it is a pleasure for our patience on earth where we abstain from pre-martial sex. People on earth have dozens of partners unlawfully(if we go by Abrahmic faiths). Often times via temporary hookups, or cheating on their partners. In Heaven, you have those partners forever(is not a limited time), and they are married to you, there is no sharing them with other guys, no cheating or temporary hookups. They are your lovers forever, which is a good and beautiful thing, and not obscene, imo. Islam is not against intimacy, it just has to be within marriage."

    "text": "That's your perspective. I don't see anything wrong with it. There is no jealousy in heaven, women will not be jealous that their husbands have wives in heaven made of light. They are a different creation and the human wife has higher status. Sex within marriage is very good and healthy. And there is no cheating in heaven. It will be a beautiful place and everyone will be happy. Unlike on earth where there are temporary hookups and cheating. Heaven is also eternal, men could use more than one wife. Wife does not need more than one man nor would accept that. They are different by nature. Also, some people already had multiple wives on earth and will take them with them into Heaven. There are lots of things to do in Heaven besides be intimate. All that being said, there is absolutely nothing wrong with it, on contrary we encourage lawful intimacy and proud of it. Those same people that complain support hooking up with dozens of a girls a year on Tinder for one guy. They are just against lawful intimacy but encourage unlawful intimacy to the maximum degree. What a clowns, lol."

    "text": "We have our Quran and Ahadeeth, and plenty of scholarly work. Actually the exact number is 2 Houri's per man in Heaven. 72 for martyrs. Martyrs are not just those who die in battle(drowning in water is martyrdom in Islam, or dying in a fire). And dying in battle does not guarantee martyrdom status. It is about intention. The Houri's are beings made out of light based on what we have in our Quran and what was transmitted about Mohammed. They are not humans from earth. Our earthly wives will be better looking than them and stand out more. Also we are not allowed to share wives. So there will be no cheating in Heaven, nor can anyone come near your wives. And Heaven is not only filled with Muslim people based on what we believe. And we believe everyone is given the beauty of Joseph and at the age of 33 in Heaven. I view lawful intimacy as a beautiful thing. I believe Heaven will be a beautiful place. We have a lot of details about it.\n\nIncluding a market where you can wear a 'skin' which is a different look that lasts temporarily."

I do not believe our wives would be jealous or bothered by that, as they are aware these beings are a creation of God to help satisfy sexual desires of men which are stronger than women on average. And these women are lawfully married to them, so it is not considered cheating. Intimacy in Heaven is purely lawful, no one can be shared, it's all within marriage. And these Houri's cannot see the other based on what I read. And there are no orgies, you can only be intimate with one at a time. The sex itself is different too.\n\nSo, these beings(Houris) are lesser beings than humans. Humans are the most superior beings, superior to Angels and Houri's. Because they are given free will and believed and earned their place in Heaven. I don't think wives would be bothered about the Houri's as they know they are superior, and will be craved more by their husbands as they are better looking. And that these Houri's are married to their husbands lawfully, and not behind her back. I think wives will be accepting of God's will to provide males with Houri's(as he is the one who marries them to men of heaven)."

If you only have 1 wife then what if she wants to do something else and you want to do her?
