If someone likes living in the sin and gets mad when we say we believe it to be a sin, we just walk away.

It doesn’t matter if you consider it a sin, the fact of matter is it’s still persecution. If the Bible said that being a redhead was a sin, it doesn’t excuse widespread, systematic abuse. LGBTQ people can be denied schooling, housing, work, even the ability to have children.

However I’m on the side of, I don’t care what gay people do behind closed doors or if they get married but I don’t think they should get married in a church as that would be disrespectful to the religion. Unless however they found a church that would be willing to do it but that would be in a minority and I’m not sure if I would even call that Christian practice. At the end of the day though I think that these people should have the right to get married and do what they want sexually in our society.\n\nWhat I disagree with is the implication that Christianity as a whole persecute gay people. Even if you were to point out 100 million people that were persecuted gay people it still wouldn’t represent the majority of Christianity. Hell even 200 million people as a small minority to Christianity. keep in mind this is me greatly exaggerating the numbers. I do not believe there are 100 or 200 million Christians in America that are spitting in assaulting gay people.So where I don’t doubt that you’ve had some problems with evil people, those groups don’t even come close to representing the whole of Christianity. I would wager that there are a couple hundred thousand christians in the world that would want to spit on you if you were holding hands with another man. That is less than 1% of the total Christian population. So if you would please stop pushing this agenda that Christians hate gay people, that would be great. Because we don’t."

Let’s ignore all of that. The fact of the matter is then, you are standing by and letting it happen. Because those groups that hate homosexuality are 100% politically active and represent your religion in politics, at least in the US. And they are most definitely hateful towards homosexuals. And even if they represent only a tiny fraction of people, then modern Christians are just ignoring it. Because it is happening. I’ve known people in small town where they were afraid to leave the house while Christian political rallies were happening. A significant amount of childhood abuse of homosexuals is religious in nature. And sure, maybe a local church only has one or two families who’d abuse their children for being gay. But when the rest turn a blind eye to it, instead of taking a firm stance against such behavior, that’s equally as sickening.\n\nNow, I will say, I know not all Christians are the type of monster who’d send a child to a conversion camp. And I know many speak out against these injustices. But until it becomes church dogma to do so, it’s hard to see the organization as a whole as being anything less than oppressive towards LGBTQ folks.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4706071/\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027795362200346X"

One, from a Christian perspective being LGTB is a sin but that doesn’t mean that LGBT people are extra bad or anything. I’m a sinner too. However, most LGTB I have to talked to at least, seem to think that being LGTB is completely fine and okay and NOT a sin. That’s the difference than most sins. Christians avoid LGBT members or fight that narrative because these people don’t believe it to be a sin when, in reality, it is.\n\nTwo, if God isn’t real, what is right and what is wrong?"

Believing that homosexuality is a sin is a frightening and hateful indoctrination of children, and it's disgusting.  Children should not be taught to hate.\n\nSecond, people should have the right to exist without the judgement and oppression from any religion, especially Christianity.  So what if someone wants to love another from the same sex?  That doesn't harm you in any way, shape or form.  Someone else getting an abortion doesn't affect you.  You people need to get your beliefs out of the lives of others.\n\nThird...society determines what is right and wrong for that society.  You think \"right and wrong\" are Christian concepts?  Jewish concepts?  You think \"right and wrong\" weren't a part of every society around the world already?  Humanity has existed for several hundred thousand years, around the globe.  Judiasm has been around for about 3500 years, and Christianity for 2000.

By gay people I’m specifically talking about the ones that think it’s not a sin and doesn’t want to listen to the other side. Also yeah no, abortion is murder so yeah. Obviously we want to stop murder. Everyone should. Plenty of non- Christians believe it too. ALSO, someone can love the same sex, that’s not a sin. The sexual part is a sin. You are the one equivocating on that. Common mistake, no harm no foul.\n\nYes I do believe right and wrong existed before any of us were even alive. Before Christianity and before any religion or society. I’m actually glad you said society determines right and wrong because now I get to ask this question. If society determined that murdering people for FUN (that’s important) is the right thing to do, would that make it a good thing to do?\n\nI actually can prove that God exists with a couple arguments.

That's all you have to do.  Leave your stupid signs, shirts, hats and hate at the church door.  We don't go around yelling and screaming at you, so stop doing it to us.

Because the society determined it to be against their morality.\n\nFinally, no, you can't prove any deity exists, much less your Christian version.

All I did was say being gay is a sin but on the same note I said everybody is a sinner and I have plenty of friends that are gay that I would defend if they were being bullied. In fact you have disrespected me multiple times when I haven’t done anything of the such such to you. You have put my beliefs on the same beliefs as a leprechaun and called my religion stupid and hateful. Look in the mirror for once. Sounds like you need too.\n\nThis is also crazy because if you go back and actually read what I said, I made the claim that most Christians avoid gay people. Most Christians do not go out of their way to demean gay people. I know of the pastor that you mentioned and there are many others like him but they are all deemed as radical as they are in the very small minority of Christianity. I’m sure that there are people of your position that would say they want to kill all Christians and stuff but I don’t relate them to you or to the whole. This is just lousy thinking on your part in further demonstrates that you have some type of hate or bias against Christians. Most of us don’t want to hear about what you’re doing behind the bedroom. The only times we care or when you’re in our face about it. We care when you come to us and tell us that we are the ones that are being hateful and we are the ones that need to stop believing what we are believing. Sorry to say but none of us are going away anytime soon. We believe the truth.\n\nThe Romans did not believe murdering people for fun was okay. You were thinking about killing. Murder is by definition and unjustified killing. So I will ask again if society thought that that was a good thing to do would that make it good? Keep in mind in that scenario you could go and kill a child for fun and that would be good in that hypothetical.\n\nWell it seems as if you already have your mind made up. You literally just said that whatever I put on the table you’re going to laugh at. This reveals your childish mindset, bias, and hate. I’ll make the transcendental argument for God.

Discrimination isn’t just being mean to someone because they are from a certain group . What those people did to the man being baptized was wrong, full stop. But gay business owners cannot legally refuse to serve Christians, and there’s no evidence they’ve even tried. There are not Christian conversion camps where children can be legally tortured to give up their faith. But guess what, there is such a thing for gay kids. This is what gay people mean when they say they are oppressed. When you are legally allowed to hurt and mistreat a group of people they become second class citizens. There are no such laws affecting Christians. In fact, the police stepped in immediately to stop the men from harassing the Christian man. So the law was on their side. This is the opposite of discrimination.\n\nTo act as if the fact that the media hasn’t reported any cases of discrimination against Christians means that it IS happening is absurd. Think about it. You’re looking at the absence of any evidence as evidence. You could make that same claim to support even the most ridiculous arguments.\n\n“Oh, guess what, dinosaurs aren’t extinct. They’re still alive now. I heard this one guy saw a T-Rex walking around. I can’t find any media stories on it. I can’t find any videos or images or evidence, but it must be that the media is censoring it. CNN is just so biased towards the anti-dinosaur narrative, so they’ll never report on it. Substitute that with vampires, leprechauns etc. it’s just foolish. Stop embarrassing yourself please.\n\nAnd I have been addressing your argument. I was addressing your argument in that specific post. I haven’t addressed your other post yet because I didn’t have time.\n\nIn my previous comment I addressed the fact that you said you could make the same argument that gay people discriminate against Christians . You presented the video. I explained why two gay men being mean to a Christian, not causing him any physical harm, and being stopped immediately by police does not equal decades and decades of systemic, legally permitted discrimination, and countless brutal hate crimes.\n\nNow, i will address the argument in your other post. It does not matter what exact number of Christians hate gay people. Even if most Christians do not hate gay people, most people who hate gay people do so because they are Christian, at least in the US.\n\nWho do you think wanted anti-sodomy laws? Who rallied against the legalization of gay marriage? What is a the faith of the supreme court justice who wants to revisit the decision that made gay marriage legal? What is the faith of parents who disown their kids or send them to conversion camps for being gay? What is the faith of the people who run those camps? What is the faith of the bakers refusing serve  gay couples? What is the faith of the people who cheer when “don’t say gay” bills are passed? Christianity. Evangelical Christians are a huge huge part of the republican party’s base. They are extremely powerful. This is why republicans try to restrict and repeal gay rights. This is why Trump pretended to be religious and did his silly little photo shoot outside a church holding a bible upside down. To cater to Christianity. Christianity is driving force behind anti gay legislation. It is the lens through which homophobia develops. While yes, not all Christians hate gay people, it is undeniable that Christianity as a system was what caused oppressive anti-gay laws.  In that sense the person who you were originally replying to was completely correct. Christians do not stop at just condemning homosexuality. Christians are invariably the ones passing laws to make it impossible to live as a gay person.\n\nMy point was never that all, or even most Christians, directly oppress or attack gay people. You were simply acting as if there is no systemic discrimination against gay people, so they had nothing to be angry about. I presented you with examples of systemic discrimination, and you tried to change the argument.\n\nBut I think what’s most telling here, is that when I presented you with all the examples of the problems gay americans face, your first reaction wasn’t sympathy. It wasn’t “wow that’s terrible.” It was to make excuses. It was to try (and fail, pathetically) to point the finger and say “well they do the same to us, so it’s ok!” What would your gay friends think of that? More importantly, what would Jesus think of that? He was famous for saying “turn the other cheek.”\n\nYou say you hate the sinner, not the sin, but the fact that you’d rather turn a blind eye to discrimination against them and blame them instead of help them, seems to show just the opposite. You’d rather disdain the sinner and leave them to their struggle than assist them.\n\nI think I will leave it to the man himself, Jesus, to explain. Because he sums you up in his own words much better than I could.\n\n“Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean”"

    "text": "Nope my position is clearly correct. I’ll explain it in a different way.\n\nLet’s say their are 400 million Christians that are exactly how you are claiming. That’s more people in the USA. That’s an entire nation for perspective. Anyways, that would be less than 2% of the entire population of Christianity. It’s a massive religion.\n\nNow, 400 million people could have enough power to change laws BUT, because the Christian community is so big, they don’t represent the whole in any way shape or form.\n\nIn reality, you are talking about less than 1 milllion people who oppress the LGTBQ community. You are looking FAR below 1%.\n\nSo now that I’ve debunked this, I want to point out that you should be happy about this. You should be happy that the overwhelming vast majority aren’t oppressing LGBTQ members. This is a good thing. It seems as if you want this to not be true and you want Christians to be the bad guy or something. Which is just strange to me."

Revaluation 13:16-17 is describing who doesn’t take the mark will be persecuted. In this case the people that don’t take the mark are Gods people. I can give you many verses to back this up.\n\nAlso it’s a reoccurring theme in the Bible that Christians are persecuted and we also see that throughout many parts of the world today and it’s increasing in America.\n\nDon’t know why you are being rude but I guess sometimes you have to reiterate when speaking to deaf ears."
