That's The Way Jesus taught. It is free, just don't hurt people and help them when needed.\n\n\nHowever, this does not put a single dime into the offering plate. Jesus taught if you want to have great rewards in heaven then give to the poor. But this is not what the churches teach, do they?\n\n\nThey churches came up with their own bible, the NIV, which lies and changes the path of salvation. The NIV teaches that to be saved you have to worship Jesus. This is not what the bible teaches, but is what the satanic NIV teaches, and now most of the churches teach this false message.\n\n\nSome pastors know they are telling lies to get people to put money in their offering plates, some do it because they don't know any better.\n\n\nThis is the truth of the matter."

    "text": "Atheists aren’t all closed minded. In fact, I’ve never met an atheist wouldn’t look at or consider evidence for God. If you approach a conversation with the idea that they are impossible to talk to and closed minded, you have to ask yourself who is actually being closed minded.\n\nI argue from the Bible for many reasons, but the biggest reason is to understand why people are so comfortable with its contents. Using examples and illustrating problems is how we learn and grow. I find the supernatural claims to be the most difficult to believe, but most of the book is difficult to believe.\n\nI’ll explain why; About 20 years ago I became very sick. Many friends and family suggested alternative Medicine and I was interested. I began reading everything I could get my hands on and I quickly learned two things.\n\n1) Alternative medicine is about 98% a scam. It appeals to emotions over facts. It ignores the failures and highlights the occasional (accidental) successes. It obscures data with double talk and lies. Alternative medicine is unfalsifiable - meaning any outcome can be twisted to support its claims.\n\n2) I instantly saw an amazing and unmistakable correlation between religion and alternative medicine. Religion appeals to emotion over facts. Religion ignores the failures and celebrates those very few (and possible accidental) wins. Religion obscures data and uses double talk to get out of trouble. Religion is unfalsifiable - again, any outcome can be twisted to support its claims.\n\nIf I argue from the Bible, I may succeed in proving this."

Witches call it magick. No one is arguing that it doesn't exist but people who can't do it.\n\nSo I learned how to manifest a life in the past while at the same time viewing it. I have done this more than 5,700 times during the course of my life, for an equivalence of over 370,000 years.\n\nBut if course, you don't believe anything you can not see. You ignore testament after testament of people who do it daily.\n\nGo back to sleep and quit wasting my time."

The reason is that there is no reason to believe in any man that has the delusion of being god. Would you believe anyone today that told you so? Probably not, so why believe in an ancient man you never even met?\nBut alright, you believe that if you give to the poor you are going to have great rewards in heaven. What exactly does giving to the poor entail though? How much are we talking about? Is it like a small price you can easily pay, or like half your stuff?\n\n\nAgain, just to be clear, I am not a christian. There's no reason to believe in what Jesus said.\n\n>Or are you a modern day false prophet to denies the words of Christ as Paul foretold?\n\nWhat if I was a real prophet though? You would just not believe me at all because you have already set your mind that Jesus was the real one and you would not believe the real prophet if it came. You would just call it a false prophet because you believe in another one. A real prophet in front of you and you would reject him then why even believe an ancient man when you don't a man directly in front of you?"

If you did all those things it would prove that you have special abilities and nothing more so what exactly do you mean? But other than that...\n\nMaking up stuff... when will theists stop doing that? (ok, I guess I am being way too broad here, theists are usually not like that!)\nWhy don't you astral project yourself to my home and tell me my address in a personal message?\nOr even better, why don't you predict a major event like an earthquake, tsunami or other natural(or not, you can also help with accidents) disaster?\nWhy don't you prove you can levitate? Go talk to magicians for that. They know the tricks and you will no longer levitate once they stop you from doing any tricks.\nSince you have seen the past, you should be able to help experts in many fields, such as history, paleontology, biology and probably many others.\nMaking similar claims I could combat what you said with saying that I am god and omniscient and so I know you are lying and that I am right.\nI bet this would be as unimpressive to you as your own ridiculous and absurd claims are to me. Why make claims that you should be able to back up, but can't really? Only one who is a...\n\n\n>\nIt is the fool who says something is not true because they have not experienced it for themselves. It is the wise who are doing things the fool thinks are impossible.\n\n\n...fool would do such a thing. Someone who is also truly into the delusion, will continue with something like that acting all wise when in fact he is not doing things, but merely claiming them. I guess that doesn't make one a fool, but delusional. I am starting to think that you might be seriously delusional. Hopefully it's just a prank of some short and everything is fine.\nIf not then you are delusional.\nIf not then please, please, back up your claims. It would shatter my world once and for all and I will never be the same person and this is good because right now I don't have much hope for anything going well. I will grow up and die and that's it and I am not particularly happy about that.\n\nIf I insulted you, my apologies. Once you prove yourself I will admit that I was foolish, mistaken or however else you think I should put it."
