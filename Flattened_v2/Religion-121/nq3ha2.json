Most schizophrenics had normal mental thought processes. Will all the religions out there and the different ways people grow up in religious structure it’s naive to simply use the “I was religious once so I know all there is to know about it”\n\nAkin to “I have a black friend I’m not racist”\n\n\nEdit: Oops went again the atheist hive mind. Forgot this is r/atheism and not r/debatereligion\n\nClose minded smh"

    "text": "Yes makes sense to equate atheism with a couple disorders. How unstereotypical.\n\nHow about a worker that moves to another company? They can understand the processes and understand why they do business the way they do and how operations work there. How about a defector from a country/regime, can they not understand how the laws and politics work? How about a brand loyalist that changes loyalties to another brand because they feel the product is better, they can’t remember what arguments there were for the former brand?\n\nNo? A disorder? Great."

    "text": "Sure ofc you can do all that. But in a more accurate example it would be some worker from a company instilling their views onto all companies. Say a worker from McDonald’s putting their experience at a fine dining restaurant. Sure some similarities but if that same worker said “I’m not taking criticism I worked years at MCDONALDS!” They’d be laughed at."

To not do so is a sign your belief (or lack thereof) is flawless."

I mean, I knew that. just wanted to see if you did.\n\n>Shouldn’t a true skeptic be constantly checking their own knowledge systems? To not do so is a sign your belief (or lack thereof) is flawless.\n\nthis is not a thread about scepticism. all atheists are not skeptics and all sceptics are not atheists.\n\nyou think that OP being upset if someone calls them a liar to their face is evidence that they are closed minded? your logic is suspect."
