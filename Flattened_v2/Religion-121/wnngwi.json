    "text": "Bismillah\n\n>In fact the Quran says Allah himself prays to Mohammad\n\n>Quran 33:56\n\nSalli alaa has a different meaning to Salli ila. Different preposition, different meaning. Allah doesn't pray TO the Prophet, sallAllahu alayhi wa sallam. Also, in our 5 daily prayers, we follow the Prophet tradition of invoking Allah to 'Salli ala Muhammad' as He did to Ibrahim. So your claim that in our tradition this is unique to the Prophet, sallAllahu alayhi wa sallam, is rejected.\n\n>Surah Al-’Ahzab – Verse 53\n\nRead the ayah again. Does it not say that the Prophet, sallAllahu alayhi wa sallam, is too shy to ask people to leave? Considering that we are obligated to follow the Prophet's commands, sallAllahu alayhi wa sallam, why would he 'invent' a verse instructing people to leave? Seems like a bit of excess effort.\n\n>Surat Al-'Aĥzāb 33:50\n\nIf His, sallAllahu alayhi wa sallam, marriages were about lust, then why did he limit his marriages? Why not unlimited marriages? Why were they all, with the exception of Aisha, radhiAllahu anha, with widows and divorcées?\n\n>Surat Al-'Aĥzāb 33:77\n\nI fail to see how anyone would consider marrying your adopted son's ex-wife as incest. Furthermore, this ruling applys to all Muslims.\n\n>Mohammad was sexually attracted to Aisha, a 6 years old girl and claimed he saw her in his dreams and therefore God told him to marry her\n\nIf this was a manifestation of His, sallAllahu alayhi wa sallam, 'lust',  why did He, sallAllahu alayhi wa sallam, wait three years to consummate the marriage? Again, considering our unquestioning obedience to him, sallAllahu alayhi wa sallam, no one would have argued had the marriage been consummated with a 6 year old.\n\n>Quran 8:41, Surat Al-'Anfāl\n\nThe Prophet, sallAllahu alayhi wa sallam, chose to lie and die in poverty. If these wars were about self-enrichment, where are all the reports of his, sallAllahu alayhi wa sallam, lavish wealth?\n\n>He only wanted Power, Sex and Wealth\n\nExcept for the first 13 years of Prophecy the Muslim community were persecuted, tortured, then boycotted and eventually forced to leave their city. That's one hell of a gamble for someone only interested in power,  sex and wealth, especially considering he was offered all three to give up the message.\n\nEven when he, sallAllahu alayhi wa sallam, had political power, this wasn't used for self-Enrichment, as he lived and died poor. As for sex, if I was only in it for the women, I wouldn't bother with marriages and just go to town.\n\nMaybe learn a little about our religion before you try to regurgitate some anti-Islam websites.\n\nPeace."

Slavery was also acceptable at those times, should I not be critical of those practices?\n\n>I accept the fact that to me… yeah it’s weird in the sense that I would never do it, and if it happened today I would consider it to be a sort of pedophelia, not just gonna deny that, but…\n\nBut what? He was appointed by god so he gets a pass? If anything his status as god's right hand on earth should have people scrutinizing him harder than the average person.\n\n>If you want to be actually consistent and not a hypocrite you have to look at both sides and realize this wasn’t something that only Muhammad (ﷺ) was allowed to do because he was a prophet, this was a common practice by many people\n\nSo? does that make the societies of Sodom and Gomorrah somehow moral? The normalization of immoral things doesn't somehow shift their impact. She was still a child, child marriages objectively harm the child. This has been proven repeatedly.\n\n>My point is you’re clearly blinded by bias, show me A SINGLE source that portrays Aisha as a victim, if she was the person you’re describing don’t you think she would’ve been gloomy and sad all the time, never really doing anything and just suffering all the time? This is the exact opposite of how she is portrayed\n\nHoly fucking hypocriticism, Allah! \"My primary source of religion portrays this child marriage as positive, which means *you're* biased.\"\n\nHow do you not see how assbackwards this position is?\n\n>Once again you’re arguments show a clear lack of knowledge, Epstein was a man doing things that are taboo and illegal in this culture today, therefore we judge him based on the rules and standards we have as a culture today, Muhammad (ﷺ) was a man doing things that were acceptable in his culture 1400 years ago, so if we aren’t hypocrites we will judge him based on his culture and standards from 1400 years ago\n\nsee what this tells me is that all that holds you back from fucking small children is societal norms. Fuck his culture, and fuck him. Again, should we have judged the sodomites by *their*culture? should we judge north african slave owners today by theirs?\n\nDo you genuinely, genuinely, believe the only reason child rape is wrong is because a majorit of people now say it?"

LIMIT his marriages 😂😂😂? oh so generous of him to say I'm not having sex anymore with more than my 11 wives and sex slaves. Clearly you haven't seen all the hadiths about how some of his wives were mad at him for being basically a pig.\n\n>I fail to see how anyone would consider marrying your adopted son's ex-wife as incest\n\nIf you fail to see how **making your adopted son leave his wife, which is also your fucking cousin, so you can fuck her, and abolish the adoption system in the process**, as a horrible thing to do, then you're a miserable human being.\n\n>wait three years to consummate the marriage?\n\noooh so generous of him to wait 3 years before fucking literally a very young child.\n\nFucking pedophile\n\n>chose to lie and die in poverty\n\nExcept he achieved what people at his time could only dream of. A kingdom of women who gave themselves to him and men who would die for him. He could have whatever he wanted. If he was hungry he could eat at whichever home he wanted. Just compare him to the actual poor people at his time to see if he really died in poverty.\n\n>Except for the first 13 years of Prophecy the Muslim community were persecuted, tortured, then boycotted and eventually forced to leave their city.\n\nAside from the torture thing (which was done by slavemasters, not justifying it but people were stupid back then, including your prophet), this is what muslims get when shitting on every other community in their country and only want themselves to thrive and rule (you people still do it today btw). Not saying that it should be done today, but you do that in a 7th century city with your clear intentions to change the entire system to a not-so-better one (as the pedophile did when he gained power), then you get what you deserve.\n\nIf people of Mecca were not that peaceful, how did they had to wait 13 fucking years before taking such actions? Does that not indicate that whoever did the torturing were not the majority and where not supported? Would your pedophile last 13 years straight if that was the case?\n\n>Maybe learn a little about our religion\n\nI learned a LOT, and that's why I left it.\n\nPeace"

You've just avoided every question and gone on a rant.\n\nExcept about his poverty, which you've somehow explained by him being able to eat in other people's houses, which I think is laughable. You're claiming that someone would invent an entire religion and suffer 13 years of oppression for the distant hope of one day being able to have a free lunch."
