So let me propose that we cut off all men's dicks since that would effectively reduce rape statistics. If women are expected to give up their right and freedom to wear whatever they want and be oppressed, why not switch it up the other way? Or pluck out all men's eyes? That way men could free up public spaces of their temptation which is the root cause of the problem rather than shift the onus of the blame to the victims."

Rights and freedom is a basic human right, whereas outdated and oppresive 'terms of duty' DO NOT BELONG IN TODAYS WORLD. Back when these things were the norm it was also alright and even commanded by the books of Abrahamic religions to rape, kill, enslave women & children as war trophies. Do you also stand by that? Do you condone slavery? Do you think it was back then the right thing to do, and you wouldn't mind if that practice was brought back? Because if you think that is wrong but expecting women to accept being oppressed is right, you're in for a ride awakening my friend.\n\n*Edited"
