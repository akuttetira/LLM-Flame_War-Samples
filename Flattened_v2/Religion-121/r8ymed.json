I suggest you do some research on the strong anthropic principle, and see some lectures of Jonathan Pageau, or Jordan Peterson so you can understand these patterns in easier terms.  Cheers"

I got so caught up in your mischaracterization, that I missed the part where you're making the argument that babies don't breath.\n\nThe idea is that unborn babies don't breath.
