There is no front-cover, but that's because this print of the bible he's holding has no front-cover as you can see in the picture the person above you linked. You know that it's rotated correctly because the tail of the bookmark string is at the bottom.\n\nYou can check the video [here](https://youtu.be/zQCHvK_pB7U?t=91), and you'll see he's holding it correctly the entire time."

He's holding it up correctly the entire time. Stop it.\n\nSee my explanation from another comment:\n\n>The bible is neither backwards nor upside-down in this picture \\[or video\\].

I hate these kinds of threads - they're easily disproven, and Trump supporters use them to invalidate any actual arguments against Trump (\"actually, Reddit is always making up shit about Trump, just see this example!\"). We don't need this misleading trash to win the election, we got the truth on our side as well"
