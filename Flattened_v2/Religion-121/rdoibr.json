    "text": "I fear you have not reached the requiered wisdom to understand what I say. Let me retry again.\n\nWhy do you question dictators and drug dealers? Because they exploit and fail you without having you owing them a thing.\n\nGod created you and thus he has \\*\\*every\\*\\* right on your being. He can put your schlong and hazel nuts upside down on your forehead then dip you in a bucket of soy sauce for the rest of eternity and that's totally just and fine because he created you.\n\nYou belong to God because you are part of his creation. But hey God is Merciful and Generous (luckily for us), he told us that if we respected him a minimum and honored him, we will be absolutely sure we wont get our shlong and hazelnuts put upside down on our forehead then be dipped in soy sauce for the rest of eternity. He told us we would have everything we want + eternal comfort.\n\nWhy would you bother trying to understand the whole universe, 5 top layers of additional mathematical/physical dimensions, vaccum the knowlegde of the structure and organisation of every atom that has gone through physical reality billion years, quantum physics, origin of elemental forces like gravity, etc...\n\nThat would requiere you to get your head frozen until humanity has found all knowledge of the universe (if it didnt collapse first or made universe collapse with it), say in like a few more billion years minimum, then you download all the knowledge into your brain that you would have upgraded technologically to include everything.\n\nAll of this to understand a finite creation that doesnt represent a tiny microgram of God's abilities.\n\nIn the end back to square one, you can't start to comprehend God's intentions because he has created the notion of \"intention\"."

    "text": ">God said himself he is Just and Merciful and that you shall follow his word no matter what\n\nWhich God? Why aren't you Jewish? If you like Jesus, then why aren't you Muslim? Is it because you happened to be born and raised Christian?\n\n\n>All efforts should be focused on being sure of his existence and in the preservation of his direct word and indirect teachings trough his messengers.\n\nThis is circular logic. Why should \"all efforts be focused on being sure of his existence\", when such an effort is only warranted by already being bought into the idea that he exists? Why do you not extend such considerations to Brahmin or Ahura Mazda?\n\n\n>There is no right for a man to judge God on his actions simple because a man cannot start to comprehend the scale and substance of God. Even the notions of \"justice\" and \"mercy\" were created by him.\n\nAs Feuerbach noted: aren't you just projecting notions created by *man* to god? Justice and mercy are contested notions among humans on earth, and various cultures has invented corresponding supernatural beliefs about them. No ontological argument justifies the idea that justice is anything other than a man-made notion relating to our social life and social evolution.\n\n\n>scale it up to infinity and absolute perfection\n\nWhat is this abstract \"perfection\" you speak of? Seems self-serving to me, a religious book reflecting a narrow history and culture, demanding particular notions of justice and behavior from others, and claiming \"perfection\" and supreme power behind its words. Easier for me to believe that whoever wrote Dueteronomy 25:11-12 was a human being and product of a specific time, than to believe that there is an unfathomable, mystical and perfect force backing those words."

Lots of assuming pal.\n\nJews got the right God but started trying to bargain with Him, which is dishonest and He didn't like that since He had to send more messengers and considered them mostly lost.\n\nChristians twisted God's idea with Trinity, closest to the Truth is Orthodoxy, which is the most conservative one when it comes to history.\n\nIn Islam it is said that it's the last update. Which would make sense for multiple reasons including the fact that it mentions a lot of stuff told in the 2 religions beforehand.\n\nI did extend these considerations but only 1 God representation was logically powerful and just.\n\nIt could be taken both ways, despite being a firm believer with a rich education, I admit that without messengers and Holy Books, you can argue your way out of religion and \"prove\" that God maybe doesn't exist. But well Quran exists so all the efforts to twist speech and philosophy into considering other alternatives are unuseful. You would need to say something like \"Quran is indeed perfect and of transcedent origin but it could be a decoy, ancient Alien Gods deciding to see who will free himself from religion despite finding overwhelming \\*proof\\* of its legitimacy\". So yeah, a direct attempt to non legitimate Quran which would be very awkward and tedious.\n\nDivine Perfection showcase is the Quran. Bible was written by men it's true, maybe Psaulms and Leviticus are righteous, the rest is man written."

Still doesn't answer why you don't.\n\n>Jews got the right God but started trying to bargain with Him\n\nI don't even know what this means, Mohamed also bargained with god lol.\n\n\n>Christians twisted God's idea with Trinity, closest to the Truth is Orthodoxy, which is the most conservative one when it comes to history.\n\nTwisted it from what, lol? The Muslim objection to the Trinity doesn't redeem or make more logical the idea of god anyways.\n\n>In Islam it is said that it's the last update. Which would make sense for multiple reasons including the fact that it mentions a lot of stuff told in the 2 religions beforehand.\n\nSo in other words, another deriviation? Also there have been a few more \"updates\", the Druze seem to have some ideas to \"fix\" the issues of Islam for example. None of these \"updates\" build much on the past except different varients of semetic superstitions.\n\n\n> I admit that without messengers and Holy Books, you can argue your way out of religion and \"prove\" that God maybe doesn't exist.\n\n\nSo without leaders espousing dogmas and written dogmas turning the question of god into an issue of dogma, you could argue against the existence of god? I could either way. Those dogmas actually give us a good look at cultural production of religion.\n\n\n>You would need to say something like \"Quran is indeed perfect and of transcedent origin but it could be a decoy, ancient Alien Gods deciding to see who will free himself from religion despite finding overwhelming \\*proof\\* of its legitimacy\". So yeah, a direct attempt to non legitimate Quran which would be very awkward and tedious.\n\n\"Perfect and transcendental\"? I never understood what this supposed miracle is - and I memorize classic Arab texts for fun. It takes zero stretch of the imagination to believe the Quran was composed by a human, just like the Avesta, Bible and Vedas.\n\nEven simple geography, literature and history of pre-Islamic Arabia - a highly poetic semetic society with longstanding trade and interaction with Christians, sizable local Jewish communities and a shared history that includes the \"patriarchal age\" of the 2nd mellenium BC, in which historic Abraham lived.\n\nThe supposed \"miracles\" of the text are largely stretches of meaning, known concepts of the time or matters of oral tradition (i.e the tale of Thamud)."
