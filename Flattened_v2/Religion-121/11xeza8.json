See Tolstoy, Goethe, Newton, etc\n\nFor context, the age of consent differs all over the world and in different places and times. Mary was 12, Cleopatra married a 10 year old. The age of consent in Italy is 14. You can’t make a blanket statement like that.\n\nWhether or not you believe, the fact remains the Quran is revelation from your Creator"
