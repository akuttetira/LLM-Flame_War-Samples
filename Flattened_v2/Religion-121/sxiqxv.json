As christian mythology directly conflicts with both science and history.\n\nMillions of people like me have likewise come to similar conclusions, and those who disagree with me often have conflicting beliefs.\n\nThere is currently no religion that has a majority on the global scale. The largest religion Christianity is only practiced by 31% of the human race.\n\nThis means that no matter which religion is the true one, most people are wrong.\n\nSo the claim that the brain shows us what god wants is not correct."

Thus nothing in existence can be Omnipotent. Since a lot of definition's for God include Omnipotence as a property of God, such Gods are impossible and can not exist.\n\nNon-omnipotent Gods do not have this problem, and are more logically consistent. However, they often contradict known reality. Thus, they are implausible but not impossible.\n\nThis is an overly simplified version of my beliefs. As going into to detail could take up a small book.\n\nPlease do not claim you know what I believe. Such arguments are very disrespectful."

    "text": ">How did you arrive to the conclusion that god is Omnipotent?\n\n​I didn't\n\nThe point I was trying to make is that I reject Omnipotent Gods specifically as illogical.\n\n>You are making a claim based on another claim in the same sentence. You need to actually provide your basis for this.\n\nYou are right, I did not provide a reason for why I believe Omnipotence was illogical. I was merely telling you what I believed. I was not explaining why I believed it.\n\nSince this is a debate sub, I guess it would be against the spirit of things to not explain my reasoning.\n\nMy main problem with Omnipotence can be summed up with the paradox of the stone. Its a pretty classic argument so you have likely heard it before, but it goes as follows.\n\n1) God Exists\n\n2) God is Omnipotent\n\n3) Since God is Omnipotent he can do anything\n\n4) Since God is omnipotent, God can create a stone too heavy that God can not lift it.\n\n5) Since God can not lift this stone he is not Omnipotent. This giving us a contradiction.\n\nThere are plenty of variations of this theorem, but the point is clear. If God is Omnipotent we must conclude god is not Omnipotent. Thus making the very concept of Omnipotence self-contradictory.\n\nTo emphasis, this only argument only works against Omnipotent Gods. If God has limits to his powers, he these issues do not arrive. Even if God is very very powerful.\n\n>what problem? you havent stated the actual problem. \"Cant exist because illogical\" is not a problem that you have proposed.\n\nPlease see above."

I already know, just need you to say it so i can confirm my initial point. (this is a hint)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Since this is a debate sub, I guess it would be against the spirit of things to not explain my reasoning.\n\noh how generous of you to grace us with your sincerity, please go ahead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>My main problem with Omnipotence can be summed up with the paradox of the stone.\n\nAgain, this is based on a specific interpretation of omnipotence, which you will need to confirm first.\n\nBut also, it is illogical for god to create a stone that he could not lift. Not only its illogical that such a stone could actually exist within our universe, it is also illogical for god to create such  stone because he doesnt need to prove your assertions which are based on faulty logic in the firsrt place. ANd this will be expanded on further once you answer earlier claims.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>To emphasis, this only argument only works against Omnipotent Gods. If God has limits to his powers\n\nseems like were making a logical progress here"

OK thats fine, ill play along.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I am convinced that know one has a cure for every type of cancer just sitting on their hard drive, because that if that person shared that info with the world, they would be instantly super famous and wealthy.\n\nTHat is a very subjective opinion, because someone could easily have the cure for cancers, or even be the one responsible for causing most cancers artificially, all in order to profit from it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>the person that could PROVE god exists, would make the cancer cure guy look like an unknown pauper, he would be worth so much money and be lauded the world over.\n\nThe theory of evolution is based on 0 facts, yet, most of the scientific community believes in it, when in fact there is no testability or falsifiability that exists that can prove the TOE to be a sound theory. This is an example of what most humans subjectively believe to be proof enough of something--the authority, and mass opinion. If I were to provide a very logical and plausible argument for why god does exist, you would still claim that its not enough of a proof, and would demand to see an extraordinary proof of seeing actual god, when on the other hand, your belief in the TOE or the Origins of LIfe is based on absolutely 0 physical facts and very little plausibility, yet it is somehow enough of a proof when it confirms your bias. Subconsciously, you create the plausibility from your personal bias on the subject, and contradictions within Christianity being the main driver of the bias.\n\n>You are not the most famous person in the world,\n\nThis proves again that your assessment of a proof or facts is not based on logic, but mainly depends on what most of the population believes, youre just going along with  the herd  like the rest of the herd, you do not think for yourself.\n\n>ergo, you do not know how to prove that your god is real.\n\nanother claim based on nothing but your personal bias and herd mentality\n\n>You are just rambling on about nothing mostly because you know this is the truth.\n\nI hope you understand the definition of \"rambling\". Because this is the 2nd time youve said it and im asking you again to quote me where ive rambled. If you cant provide the actual proof of your claim then the only other conclusion to be made is that you are trying your hardest to insult me."
