    "text": "Lol,\n\n1. There is no universally accepted Bible - Yes everyone to should sit and take counsel, then vote for a universal Bible.  Hence, we become our own god.  SMH\n2. There is no universal description or characteristics of their god.  LOL.  The answer for number 1 will work for this also.\n3. there is no universal acceptance on interpretations or whether the bible or the events within are literal or allegorical.  LMAO.  the same answer for both 1 and 2 can work for this also.(sarcasm is being used for these 3 points)\n\nYour ignorance is to be expected as even the entire Christian world for most part is apostate.  But  let me assure you that those 3 points are trivial and can be researched easily for the answers.  Let me give something to think on:\n\n1. First problem with your \"universally accepted bible\" is that even if everyone on the planet including Past, present and future accepts a particular translation does not authenticate the accepted version.\n2. Once you authenticate the Bible the rest of your query goes out the door.\n3. BTW, the Bible can be authenticated and through scientific means proven."

The real question is how does someone authenticate the message.  So if you want to stick on your point of universalism go on. Be my guest.  But know this, all you are doing is hiding."

How do you all know mary's birth was immaculate? : Answer - She said so, that's all christians need.\n2. How do you all know Jesus was the son of god? many people did miracles, nor does doing miracles make one the son of god. :Answer - Because he said so.\n\nBible proves Bible works for christians, hearsay works for them, hearsay of anecdotes work for them."

    "text": "Lol,  I am having fun.  that is your problem.  You have no idea at all on the way forward concerning the Bible and your questions.  Again, I do not blame you.  She or he said so has noting to do with the authentication although these were eye witness accounts.  You say Hearsay, but Prove that it was hear say.  That is your problem.  Now what you would do is google and get somebody arguing from authority(LMAO) but did not witness the thing.  I want you to provide proof that it was Hearsay and just know that an argument from authority holds no water as the penman were for the most part giving eyewitness account.  Waiting on you proof. LMAO"

    "text": "See, here you go again. \"Lol. I'm having fun.\" You are either just a huge bitch, or scared of an argument that disproves the worldview you have been spoon fed your whole life.\n\n\nYou tell this person \"Prove is it hearsay!\" But that is not how it works. YOU are making the claims, the burden of proof lies with you. You dont PROVE a negative. If I say I have captured the lockness monster and she is in my pool, hopefully you dont just take me at my word. I am making the claim. It is on me to prove it. And if I have some reason why you cant come see her, the default should be disbelief until PROVEN she is there. It would not be on you to disprove this wild claim, it would be on me, the one making the wild claim, to prove it. Otherwise it should be met with disbelief as that is the default until proven otherwise."
