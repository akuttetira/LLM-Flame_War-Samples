    "text": "Your right it could be argued but no one knows all the islamic prophets because not all of them were mentioned. The people in pre islamic Arabia didn't know Jesus before muhammad became a prophet including Muhammad himself because christianity didnt stretch that far, instead they had local religions that worshiped statues around the kabah. After he became a prophet and introduced islam, Muhammed didnt refer to him as Jesus like christians did, but rather Issah, so even if you asked arabians back then if they knew Jesus after islam I don't they'd say yes.\n\nAdressing your last question, islam believes there are many prophets that were sent that had they're message changed overtime, and that it isn't limited to just Jesus and Moses, or the other 23 prophets that were named. That's why many muslims, and they're children from all over the world memorize the quran word for word, so it doesn't get changed with time. Neither scholars or I, can say Zoroastrians came from islam because god didnt tell us, but its not confirmed that it came from its own thing either."

I'm just saying it's a possibility because not all prophets were mentioned, so its possible that it was never copied. But the simple fact is I don't know, and no one on reddit knows.\n\nAnd about you saying the Quran did change, I remember a few years back I saw on the news that a university in the UK found a 1400 year old Quran, that was written on sheep skin. I did some research and it said they found that not a word has changed. Heres a link, but there are many others now that years have passed.\n\n[https://themuslimvibe.com/muslim-current-affairs-news/oldest-quran-discovery-proves-the-holy-quran-has-never-been-change](https://themuslimvibe.com/muslim-current-affairs-news/oldest-quran-discovery-proves-the-holy-quran-has-never-been-changed)\n\nAnd about you converting, Im sad you left, but if that's what you believe in then that's all that matters. Whoever tells you they know for sure what's out there is lying, we don't. The only thing we can do is make assumptions and follow what we believe in."

So there is a chance that the founder of Zoroastrianism was a Muslim Prophet. Now Muslim doesn’t mean someone who follows Islam it means someone who has submitted to the one singular God.\n\nKhorasan itself was Zoroastrian/ Fire worshippers. But they converted to Islam and before you because they were forced. They weren’t conquered by the arabs. The people choose to join Islam on their own. Khorasan is the regions of Afghanistan, Iran and a bit of Pakistan. So if Islam copied Zoroastrianism why didn’t they call it out?"

It's a claim to bolster is authority while \"excusing\" any information he copies.  If this was true we would expect to see similar abramic teachings in other parts of the world that align with the bronze and iron ages.  But we dont.\n\n>So there is a chance that the founder of Zoroastrianism was a Muslim Prophet.\n\nNo, not any serious chance that someone without bias would consider.  Saying he might be a muslim prophet carries no more weight then saying he was a Taoist prophet.\n\n>Now Muslim doesn’t mean someone who follows Islam it means someone who has submitted to the one singular God.\n\nIf you want to use \"Muslim\" to mean any monotheist in history, fine, but *prophet* for islam means something specific.\n\n>So if Islam copied Zoroastrianism why didn’t they call it out?\n\nHow would you know that some didn't, just because 1 or 2 people joined (and recieved political power out of it so...) doesn't mean others didn't call it out."

They knew there were other religions similar to what was being preached by Mohammed, so it's easy to go \"um yeah its similar but mine is actually the right one, trust me, its the way they would have originally been taught\".\n\nIt's a cop out.  A way to claim authority (unfoundedly) of other religions and faiths.  There is 0 evidence for this, as we only see religions similar to islam in the regions we would expect to seem that had the evolved naturally without prophets.  Where are these monotheistic abrhamic religions ins China, North America? Northern Europe?

Because In Islam we believe that Moses was a Prophet and his nation and early followers were Muslim. We believe Jesus and his early followers were Muslim. However we believe the holy scriptures that had and message was slowly slowly corrupted. You see Muslim usually have a big problem with Christians because they started worshipping a prophet of god not God himself and went even further when they started the trinity belief of God.

The common claim is that the Quran contains knowledge that would have been impossible to know at the time, and i'm saying thats absolutley false.  For specific things it gets wrong, it messes up the Jesus birth story by borrowing from an aporchyal source, and presents a geocentric view of the solar system.\n\n>You can’t make these claims without giving your evidence for this.\n\nAgain, backwards.
