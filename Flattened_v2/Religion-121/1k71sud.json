Nationalism is what keeps the Palestinian occupation (and nearly other Muslim conflicts) alive. Without a khilafa that upholds sharia, this will be how things are."

It could be a lot like a large union of all the Muslim countries with someone at the head as khilafa. Doesn't necessarily mean people are going to be nationalist, it just makes stuff easier to run."

    "text": "I agree with you completely- a country (by definition) means a politically independent body. This is what we need to be against. What we would call countries would act more as states or provinces - there could be a level of independence, but certain things must be handled from a federal aspect. There are many ways a khilafa could work, but it never will as independent countries."

    "text": "Yeah, sort of like how the European Union has certain laws followed by all its members, Muslim states will have to follow the sharia set by the caliph.\n\nIslam is huge and you can't just govern all Muslim lands with one body. There's a reason why we don't have a one world government but have some agreed upon rules like those set in the United Nations."
