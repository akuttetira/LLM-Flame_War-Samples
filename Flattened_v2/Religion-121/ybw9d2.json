As they were walking along by its side a countryman passed them and said: “You fools, what is a Donkey for but to ride upon?”*\n\n*So the Man put the Boy on the Donkey and they went on their way. But soon they passed a group of men, one of whom said: “See that lazy youngster, he lets his father walk while he rides.”*\n\n*So the Man ordered his Boy to get off, and got on himself. But they hadn’t gone far when they passed two women, one of whom said to the other: “Shame on that lazy lout to let his poor little son trudge along.”*\n\n*Well, the Man didn’t know what to do, but at last he took his Boy up before him on the Donkey. By this time they had come to the town, and the passers-by began to jeer and point at them. The Man stopped and asked what they were scoffing at. The men said: “Aren’t you ashamed of yourself for overloading that poor donkey of yours and your hulking son?”*\n\nNo matter what I do will you twist my words in your ego?\n\n**Proverbs 1:22-26 “How long, foolish ones, will you love ignorance? How long will you mockers enjoy mocking and you fools hate knowledge? If you respond to my warning, then I will pour out my spirit on you and teach you my words. Since I called out and you refused, extended my hand and no one paid attention, since you neglected all my counsel and did not accept my correction, I, in turn, will laugh at your calamity. I will mock when terror strikes you.”**"

Like you see how it sounds when you’re part of .01% of the population that understands it the way you do, and the implication that everyone else is wrong (even people who share a lot of your other beliefs!)

The amount of people who believe in it has nothing to do with its truth. Even if everyone in the world believed it, you could still ask how to know who's right.\n\nWe can tell what is true doctrine, by how much it conforms to the one true Eastern Orthodox Church. But if you want to know further how to know if a paradigm like Orthodoxy is true, that is a question of epistemology, metaphysics, etc., and every worldview has the same issue."
