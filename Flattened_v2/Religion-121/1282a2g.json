    "text": ">Am I to believe that murderers and rapists who accept Jesus can go to heaven and have a good after life?\n\nYep. Do you think yourself better than a rapist? To God you are not. We are all desperately wicked. Don't feel arrogant just because you don't so x sin you deem worse. At least the rapist is actually repentant and sorry. Those in hell are obstinate wicked people, and therefore deserve it.\n\n>Everyone who has a different belief system, regardless of their good and bad deeds, goes to hell and has a bad afterlife?\n\nYes, your Good deeds are irrelevant. They are filthy rags before God and they do not erase or outweigh your bad deeds. We are damned, period. The ONLY way out is Jesus. Jesus is the ONLY person who has made a way for us. No one gets to God except through Him. No exceptions.\n\n>That seems like a bad system and a cruel God.\n\nJustice usually seems cruel to us wicked.\nBut it's not. If you (general you, not you personally) have rejected Jesus then you have rejected your rescue plan, you have spit in the face of grace and mercy... now, all that is left... is fire."

If I murder you... bringing water to an old lady doesn't mean I didn't murder. That's nonsense. Our evil is a stain that drags us into the cleansing fire.\n\nNo, because Alice still murdered, or lied, or is homosexual, or divorced (except due to cheating or a non believer demanding one), etc. Sure Bob may be 100^100 sins but your 100^99 sins don't save you. Better is not the standard. That's fantasy. Perfect, moral perfection, that is the standard and that's why we are SCREWED; damned.\n\nWithout Jesus\n\n>No one can possibly do anything to dersve infinite torture. In fact, I don't think anyone ever dersves torture at all.

If I steal 1 candy and murder 1 person the crimes are the same quantity... but the quality are completely different. One rebellion against God almighty, the King of Kings is a grave sin. Treason is a grave sin. It's the principal sin.\n\nBesides, who are you to dictate how much time a sin is worth? By what objective moral standard do you judge your maker. You have none, nor hope of one. We are damned. Without hope, unless Jesus.\n\nIf you don't think so then your sense of justice is evil. You're the problem. You're in the wrong. Not God.\n\nYes, He is totalitarian. He did make, and therefore owns, totality. All of reality is His. He is the King of kings.\n\nNo, not might make right, property rights make right. But, who cares? If you want to think of it s might, go for it. There's still no way without Jesus."

I would sooner choose any of a dozen other belief systems that have a grasp for human empathy.\n\nIf he exists and chooses to burn me forever, that's his choice I guess, but it really seems like he wants to burn a ton of people if he's omnipotent and omniscient and still burns everybody who doesn't believe the right parts of a random bunch of letters stapled together that are full of contradictions."

I dont think I am wicked, and so isnt my family. I dont think we deserve eternal hell just fot not believing in someone who doesnt have any proof for their existence.

I have a terribly sick throat right now and you still made me laugh. What you said is everything, just not justice. I give food to wild animals on winter with my family, I give money to charity, animal shelters etc. but I am sinner for what? For being gay? For ever lusting? They are natural occurrences in both humans and animals and therefore are not sins. Oh wait, your god said so.

Don't confuse my words for saying something like theft is equal in moral abhorrent-ness to rape. That's nonsense. But just because a rapist sin is 10^100 doesn't mean your 10^99 sin does you any favors. We are all morally abhorrent.\n\n> I dont do harm, steal, rape etc. yet your god thinks I am on the same level as someone so disgusting?\n\nI doubt that. You harm God with your treason. I'm sure you've harmed other people too, so we can add liar in here now. You've never stolen? Have you given God what belongs to Him? No?  Thief. Rape,  maybe not, but have you ever lust for the opposite sex? Or worse, the same sex? Then you have definitely done Reprehensible sexual sin. Yes, thought crimes count. But, besides all that. You're still shinto. Still treasonous. That's the worse off all. Your good deeds are USELESS! If I murder a woman and then give 1 trillion dollars to the poor.... my charity doesn't erase my murder. Our evil damns us. But there's one out: Jesus\n\n>So all the rapist needs to do is be sorry? Lets say your god's judgement actually exists, and they are truly sorry.\n\nYes, they need to acknowledge they are sinful and wicked; and sincerely decide to (though they will fail) make God their God... ie repent and stop the treason. Capitulate to God's demands. Even Stalin or Pol pot, these disgusting communists who genocide millions for their inherently repugnant idealogy could be saved in this way.\n\n>Would they also regret it if it did not exist?

I dont think we deserve eternal hell just fot not believing in someone who doesnt have any proof for their existence. Thats a good load of BS if u ask me, and terribly unjust, for a just god.\n\nI'm not sure what you're question is asking. Who or what didn't exist? God, or? Cuz you said \"it\"... idk what it is referring to.\n\nThat doesn't prove what you think it proves. People are deplorably evil now, all deserve death, now. So... then continuing to be evil and wretched without God isn't a flex. However, no, that's nonsense, without the literal source of goodness you can't be Good.

There is no way.\n\nYour arbitrary moral opinion about your own moral wellness is valid how? By what objective moral standard do you deem yourself righteous. You have none. What you feel isn't important. There is an objective standard and we will be judged by it. We fail, 100% of the time.\n\nJohn 3:16-21 and Romans 1 basically say that we know full well about God, but we reject Him because we love evil. We are so opposed to Him that we put ourselves into self inflicted delusions. So, you're \"just fot not believing in someone who doesnt have any proof for their existence\" will not fly as an excuse.\n\nThere's only one salvation, one hope, Jesus Christ."

I can say with absolute certainty that I am a much better person than a rapist. Because I have reasonable morals that stem from empathy, thats something your god lacks.\n\n>I doubt that. You harm God with your treason.\n\nTreason? A god that intentionally created humans and punishes them if they dont believe in him is so unbelievably pathetic and doesnt deserve anyone's worship. Why cant he just erase all the suffering he made? He could stop the murders, rapes, abuse, wars, famines, diseases etc. etc. yet he never did anything. I hope he is having fun, watching us suffer. He makes Satan look like the good guy (he is). I'd rather make a shrine for some tinkerbelle fairy than such a piece of shjt like the christian god, because thats what he is.\n\nThankfully the bible was written by humans.\n\n>I'm sure you've harmed other people too, so we can add liar in here now.\n\nLol you think I have ever went ballistic on someone with a knife or something? Is that how you view the average non-christian? And how is lying relevant to it? These things are not even related. And if I have to lie, its because I dont wanna do a school project because of my anxiety, or some other silly stuff.\n\n>You've never stolen?\n\nStolen what? A random bracelet I found on a grassfield as a kid? Thats hardly any sin, lol. Other than that, no. Unless you count finding something on the ground as a sin.\n\n>Thief. Rape, maybe not, but have you ever lust for the opposite sex? Or worse, the same sex?\n\nIs your god such an idiot that that he created humans with their natural urges and later declared it a sin? Did he create homosexuality among animals and humans and later declared it sinful without bothering to remove it from us? What a hypocrite. Religion aside, homosexuality hurts absolutely no one and its just as natural. No one is forcing you to watch gay porn. 💀\n\n>You're still shinto. Still treasonous.\n\nMuch more worth it than a religion written by men to suit men (and not that much women).\n\n>I'm not sure what you're question is asking. Who or what didn't exist? God, or?

What you said goes against Jesus's teachings btw. That is, to love everyone. He would never say that anyone deserves death.\n\n>without the literal source of goodness you can't be Good.\n\nGod? God is good? After he flooded the earth with many innocent people and commanded to murder egyptian babies among countless other things? Who considers natural occurences a sin? He can get flushed in my toilet for all I care. He doesnt deserve anyone's respect.\n\n>How do you define Good and evil, in any objective way, without immutable creator God? There is no way.\n\nIs this another \"No morals without god\"? I have morals because I have empathy for others and I care for a lot of people and animals. I dont need any god to have a moral understanding of whats right and whats not. I know murders, rapes etc are evil, and I knew harming others is wrong ever since I was little, and didnt know about any christianity being a thing. I didnt even know it existed.\n\n>Your arbitrary moral opinion about your own moral wellness is valid how?\n\nAgain, that stems from empathy and understanding. I dont need any god to care for living beings. Read the text above.\n\n>What you feel isn't important.\n\nThen god should have made humans not feel any emotions.\n\n>but we reject Him because we love evil\n\nI dont love evil, I am not a sadist, I dont torture and harm living beings, but oh, I am sexually into women, guess I deserve eternal hellfire. Nice logic you got there.\n\n>There's only one salvation, one hope, Jesus Christ.\n\nThe difference between muslims or christians and other religious people is that you proselytize as if ur life depends on it. I would like to remind you that chances of someone converting to ur faith just because you pasted a copypasta are critically low."
