That does not mean I am going to go out and kill people. That is fallacious way of thinking as its jumping to conclusions.

It literally doesn't affect you.\n\nAnd yes I will ignore your gish gallop attempt to copy paste a set of cherry picked verses and then demand an explanation. I don't owe you a single explanation because all the negativity you extrapolate is all in your head clearly fueled by emotions.

Oh how terrorizing Islam is for saying non believers go to hell....like all the other world religions ever, and this subject doesn't even need religion to justify you are trying to defend someone who tries to equate the creator with the created could there be more injustice in that doing? You sent verses about how disbelievers go to hell well they are 100% self explanatory and we own them no one hides them, I can't fathom how you are trying to say someone who dies as a disbeliever and that disobeys god goes against religion has as the right to the same fate as someone who puts his forehead to the ground 5 times every day in humility to god as someone who volunteers himself to go on strike against food and drinks from dawn to sunset every day for an entire month for the sake of god I could go on and on and on but what you're calling for is the biggest form of injustice does a virtues man have the same abode as a drug addict?

But Allah’s mercy!) While still not addressing why Allah makes such nefarious, alarming claims: you aren’t addressing why Allah is making a clear claim of an unforgivable sin with eternal punishment in several verses, not just one.\n\nI never said you brought up the Arabic part, I said Muslims I’ve talked to have done that.

If yes then sure we agree I don't see how you one couldn't I mean certainly in the afterlife one who goes to heaven is a winner and one who goes to hell is a loser just like if I go to hell I'm a loser and if you go to heaven you're a winner, now regarding superiority of belief then guess what every belief ever does that if you don't believe in said belief, republicans think their beliefs are superior to democrats, christians think their belief is superior to mine I mean if you  don't think that  then how come are you a christian if you equate your belief to such a \"terroristic\" religion like Islam, now that doesn't mean that me as a human is superior to you as a human nor does it mean you are superior to me and I can already hear you say whataboutism I mean if you don't prove I'm wrong and if everyone that has every believed in something does it and must do it how come I am wrong prove I'm wrong, so yes every religion believes they are the winners in the afterlife and all else are losers including yours and you can't deny that otherwise guess we will both go into heaven according to you and yes you must believe your belief is superior to the contrary that's why you believe it, now if you think that it means losers on earth you're just wrong blatantly\n\nThirdly I never said how could you disobey god I don't give a damn I said how could one disobey and one who obeys be equated like you are asking for which is also applied in your faith so nice straw man I also haven't mentioned god's mercy so nice straw man again and every god of every religion makes that claim\n\nFourthly yeah he said it's unforgivable and I gave you reason why it couldn't be otherwise and by the way it's unforgivable if you die on it just like your faith and every faith and still you just keep saying you are wrong without evidence I feel like I'm debating a child honestly you're arguments are laughable please educate yourself\n\nEdit: the most emphasized point you have is that it's unforgivable if you die on disbelief I just want to ask will I go to heaven I don't believe in the divinity or godhod of Christ and I don't belief in the infallibility of the modern day bible nor do I believe in the Trinity of god do you really want me to open your Bible and tell you how your faith tells me the exact same thing as mine tells you?"

You literally, once again, just spouted whataboutism fallacies and continued ignoring the verses and cherry picking Allah's mercy and simply offered your own hermeneutics (You are also rambling a lot with irrelevant stuff for some reason) that was filled with contradictions. It's that simple. You did this again, literally with your recent reply, astonishingly, which leads me to believe you are incapable of having a discussion because you are not comprehending what is being said.\n\nAgain, you are not **addressing the verses**.\n\nYou talking about the \"disobedience of Allah\" means nothing to me because I and most other people don't believe in Allah. Second, you once again contradict yourself with Allah's mercy with verses that talk about UNFORGIVABLE sins and ETERNAL torment. Which leads me to believe you are not comprehending the meanings of words or being intentionally dishonest to avoid the uncomfortable topic that your Allah contradicts himself and is cruel beyond means punishing people for simply not believing with eternal torment.\n\nAgain, even if we are \"disobeying\" your God for simply not believing in him. i don't see how that would justify eternal torment. That is just cruel and silly. I don't think I want to believe in a God like that. Thanks for showing how Islam is cruel beyond comprehension.\n\nYou saying \"Straw Man\" does not make what I said a straw man, I don't think you know what that means. Nothing I said indicated a Straw Man anywhere.\n\n\"Fourthly yeah he said it's unforgivable and I gave you reason why it couldn't be otherwise and by the way it's unforgivable if you die on it just like your faith and every faith and still you just keep saying you are wrong without evidence I feel like I'm debating a child honestly you're arguments are laughable please educate yourself\"\n\nYou are all over the place, wow. You realize this entire mess you said is a contradiction and you simply illustrating severe cognitive dissonance, right? The fact you agreed that it's UNFORGIVABLE means you agree with me. You do realize UNFORGIVABLE does not mean: \"can be forgiven sometimes\". I sincerely hope you realize that, so there is no way you can agree then try to disagree, mate."

No guess what eternal torment I suggest you leave Christianity on the same bases then because Jesus is cruel and so is every religion ever please show me what religion allows everyone into heaven\n\nRefere back to where I said straw man you are straw maning I explained it and provided examples\n\nI haven't contradicted myself please provide evidence to where I did so, and I know what unforgivable means I don't think you understand what Allah mercy's is\n\nUnforgivable= no mercy no forgiveness\n\nMercy is for the believers only just like drum roll please your faith tadaaa\n\n41:51/52 \"Have you ˹O Prophet˺ not seen those who were given a portion of the Scriptures yet believe in idols and false gods and reassure the disbelievers1 that they are better guided than the believers?
