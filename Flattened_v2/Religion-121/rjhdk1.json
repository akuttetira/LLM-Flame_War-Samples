    "text": "Most people fail to understand that there is something greater going on than we can really grasp. God's character is on the line, and Satan has done his best, and still trying, to bring God down and smear His good name. God is loving and all-knowing (doesnt mean He makes peoplendo bad things or that is His fault), but sin has entered into this world, and that causes so much suffering, not God. There's a great controversy going on, and we are all a part of it. God is giving people a chance to see who He is and see who satan is.\n\nOne day, God will restore all to His original plan, removing the suffering and restoring everything to being perfect and without sin, but first, He is allowing the sin to play out in order to show His character and reveal satan's lies. God is love, which means He does not force anything or intervene without being invited. Yes, many babies and children suffer, but that isn't God's fault. That is due to someone else's sin."

    "text": "In the Hebrew traditions, which Jesus as a Jew was raised in, Satan was never evil, nor enemy to God or humankind. In their beliefs, angels and archangels weren't endowed with free will as humankind were. Lacking free will, even if the notion could even occur to one to disobey God, or rebel against God, they would be unable to do so, and compelled to do only the bidding of God.\n\nSatan was set to this task...to place challenges and adversity in the paths of human beings, for the purpose of motivating them to rise to meet the challenges, overcome them, and increase in wisdom and understanding during their mortal lives. Satan was also there to observe silently, as he would also serve as prosecutor on the day of judgment.\n\nThe Hebrews believed that Satan was a great blessing which God had bestowed upon them, for these purposes.\n\nI propose that it's the Roman Catholics who've smeared the good name of Satan, and their efforts were supported by the Protestants who believed the embellishments of the R.C.C. priests who taught that either heaven or hell were final destinations for human souls. Because in Hebrew belief, heaven was only the abode of God and His holy angels, and God didn't create a hell for eternal damnation and torture of human souls."

    "text": "So you say that a god exists.\nCould you prove it or do we have to rely on your say-so?\nIf you can't prove it then your opinion is just an opinion.\n\n\nMost people don't fail to \"understand\" what you are saying.\nThat's what most people think.\n\n\nWhat they fail to understand is the the problem of evil pretty much disproves the notion of god that they hold.\nThey don't want that so they will invent ways in which the problem of evil does not disprove their god.\n\"Maybe god has his reasons\". \"God works in mysterious ways\". \"We are like infants that don't understand that the vaccine is good for them\"\n\n\nAnd many more excuses.\n\n\nThere's also the problem of devine hideness.\nGod wants to have a relationship with us but he fails even when people are doing all they can to have that relationship.\n\n\nThen we go to round 2 of excuses.\n\"Maybe we don't pray the right way\" \"Maybe he is communicating and we don't understand the signs\" \"Maybe he is testing our faith or has his reasons\"\n\n\nPeople never stop and ask: \"Maybe he doesn't exist\"\n\n\nAnd now let's see what's the most likely explanation based on what we observe.\n\n\nIf I see a person doing a horrible thing, is it not much more likely that they are a horrible person than that they are the best person possible, but they have their reasons?\n\n\nBut people just can't give it up. It's depressing, because I can't see people believing as people that freely chose to do so when their location almost determines what they believe.\nIf I have a very stupid belief because of where I live and you point it out to me, I will be a bit stubborn at letting it go, but eventually, I will.\n\n\nI think this is true for most people, but never for religion.\nNo no no no no, you aren't supposed to do that.\n\n\nHarsh truths are harder to accept.\nMaybe if I have a belief that is stupid that the truth would be hard if you let me know, then maybe I would have been much more stubborn at letting it go, but I think that eventially(like 10 times longer than in the first case) I would.\n\n\nBy the way, if you convinced me that god exists, that would be delightful(if he is omnipotent and omnibenevolent, because in that case I will get what I deserve, although the way this god is often described, he is scary...\nHe may think I deserve eternal punishment for example and has made it such that I will never have the chance to change my mind after I die.\nWell, if I can't do something to avoid eternal punishment that's going to be depressive but I assume that a good god would give plenty of ways? I mean different people seem to believe differently on that part so if it's a good god and it's likely that he is going to be good to us when we die, then certainly I would be delightful to be convinced of him\nAs it stands right now, people just can't explain what \"seems\" to be horrible horrible actions that are more fitting to devil than god. Perhaps devil got into god and now god, is confused. That would explain why his \"word\" is so confused, along with his actions.\nWhen god wins satan, then everything will become clear but until then we are on our own.)"

I understand what is going on; it simply makes sense to me. God is loving and is allowing actions to play out, and whatever happens, He is just in His judgment because He knows every heart. Bad things are happening in this world due to sin that began when the devil deceived someone. All God wants is for us to give Him our hearts. He wants to change us and restore us back to His image. If everyone did that and followed the guidelines, there wouldn't be anything wrong. But people make choices each day, and God respects that. But there will come a day when He will allow those choices to come to completion.\n\nAnd I am trusting in Him so that I can see the day when all of this sin problem comes to an end."

If he did, there would be no consequences for not liking him. Instead, he is obsessed with getting loved back, or else...\nBut of course, we send ourselves away from him and it's not like he could have done it such that being away from him doesn't hurt...\nAnd he is omnipotent...\nIt just does not add up at all.\n\n\n\\>And I am trusting in Him so that I can see the day when all of this sin problem comes to an end.\n\n\nAnd so does everyone else for their religion.\nA hell of a lot people are wrong at best.\nAt worst, all of the religious are wrong.\nThere's no more reason to think one religion is right than another.\nBut there's no good reason to think any of them is right.\nAnd there are some good reasons to think that an omnibenevolent, omnipotent and all-knowing god does not exist so a lot of those religions are just not possible to be true, or actually not likely."

    "text": "Everything I said is proven in the Bible, whether or not someone wants to believe it or see it.  That is my proof and what backs up my statements. Just because all of Christianity does not agree with it doesn't make it incorrect. Many people hold beliefs held on by traditions and nothing else. I know that the devil has influenced and created many different religions but nothing compares to the Bible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot sure if you have since I don't know you but you should check out one of the posts I have made on a study in Proverbs. Pretty easy to follow along. Explains the mystery of God and what it is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGod does respect choices, which is why there is sin in the world and why He allowed the devil to sin in the first place. Had He just destroyed the devil as soon as He did something wrong, the devil's accusations would have been proven correct that God is just selfish and evil, but allowing the devil to play out his own actions and the consequences to those actions shows that God is good and loving. There are guidelines in the Bible. Most Christians don't understand them because of a very popular teaching that laws were done away with at the cross when that isn't true. There is so much misunderstanding due to traditional teachings and lack of study that people simply just don't get it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost people, I'm sure we can agree, see hell as this place the devil is in charge of and a person will be tortured for all eternity because of some wrong doing or maybe being atheist for a short time, like example 10 years. How does that make any sense? Why would a loving God punish a person for 10000000x years for only 10? Answer: He wouldn't. This is a common teaching, but it isn't any where in the Bible. Yes, there is a punishment, but it isn't forever. It has a time limit, unknown what that time is, but it does have an ending. People would be absolutely miserable knowing others are suffering when they are enjoying things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBig picture friend. God doesn't want His children to live experiencing pain and suffering and sadness, which is why He will reward them with everlasting life and happiness. God wants a relationship with us and can only give that reward with those who want the same thing. If someone hated God and had to spend forever worshipping Him when they really didn't want to would be miserable forever. God doesn't want that. It's like a person's relationship with their children. I don't want my children to suffer and have harm come to them. I would that they were happy and perfect and had everything they needed. God is the same way for us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo me, it isn't about what religion is right or wrong. It is about following God and His word. If a religion just happens to fall in line with that, wonderful. If not, there is probably a misunderstanding there. I can't speak much on other religious books, but I've read some of the book of Mormon and that one doesn't fall in line with the Bible, which is the standard I use to see how everything else \"religious\" measures up. There are understandings Christians have that simply don't fall in line with the Bible, and that makes for a lot of confusion and, I believe, discouragement. Turns people away from God because they don't really understand the greater picture.\n\nExample: People use the term \"God's will\" incorrectly. Like a child with cancer. \"If it is Your will God\". Why would God want a child to have cancer? That wasn't His will at all. He allows things to happen, but that doesn't mean He wanted it or willed it to happen. That is another BIG misunderstanding."

He does what is evil, he is evil.\nInstead, you redefine it not to be evil \"because god is so good that he respects free will\"\nHe should have stopped devil, no doubt about that.\n\n\n\\> God wants a relationship with us and can only give that reward with those who want the same thing.\n\n\nYou see? He doesn't want us to choose freely whether we like to be his friend or not. Instead, he wants to be friends so will reward those who will also want to be his friend even though desires aren't under one's control...\n\n\\>If someone hated God and had to spend forever worshipping Him\n\n\nWhy would god want you to praise him like that?\nDoes he not see there's no honor in that?\nPerhaps the devil entered him and controls him.\nThat makes more sense than an omnibenevolent god that's perfect in every way and yet demands to be worshipped, thinks it's a good thing.\n\n\n\\>but I've read some of the book of Mormon and that one doesn't fall in line with the Bible\n\n\nWell, the bible doesn't fall in line with the book of Mormon then.\nYou are not following god's word.\nSee? that's a big issue unless you can show that one of all the religious books is actually from god.\nHowever, none contains anything of particular interest...\nThey all seem so man-made.\n\n\n\\> Why would God want a child to have cancer? That wasn't His will at all. He allows things to happen, but that doesn't mean He wanted it or willed it to happen. That is another BIG misunderstanding.\n\n\nIf he is in absolute control(being omnipotent) and still allows it to happen, then it's his choice and let's not forget that the universe was designed by him this way so that cancer would occur.\n\n\nNow, if you can't answer why god did what he did and when what he did reveals a bad god, that doesn't seem to be omnipotent, omnibenevolent and all-knowing then you can no longer claim that he is...\nYou can believe it, you can propose reasons how it is a possibility that god would allow such things, but you can't claim that's the most fitting conclusion.\nThen you can go ahead and have that conclusion yourself because you simply can't conclude that god doesn't exist.\nI can. I can also conclude that he does.\nUnfortunately, the evidence shows that he does not.\nIf somehow new evidence emerges, then I may as well conclude that he does.\nI am not sure what evidence would do that, but god should know and he hasn't produced said evidence.\nIt's just how it is and the fact that you think that he has already given plenty of evidence is simply irrelevant.\nI see and judge and I know that people mostly think so because they have been influenced from a very young age to think that way.\nIt's a known effect and explains why people always find that the religion they were born into is clearly true, as you are doing here.\n\n\nAt the very least it should cause you to pause and think about it, but it doesn't look like you are doing that and honestly why am I even responding to you is a mystery because there's really no point as you are just blinded by your religion.\nWhen you manage to put your religion away from your eyes, you may see the truth. You have to put it aside first and re-evaluate from the beginning.\nGood luck with that and I hope I wasn't insulting towards you.\n\n\nOne last note: Your concept of the afterlife is interesting, I would like to hear more details on that one.\nIf I like it, I will be very delighted to find out that your god's real.\nI might even be biased in favor of your god in that case, desperately wanting everything to be ok in the end."

    "text": "Then I will respond to your last point since that is interesting to you, but just like to comment on the being blinded part- I wasn't necessarily raised believing or not believing in God. I went through my own hardships of abuse and had a lot of hate for Him and was, at some point, atheist, so I'm not just blinded by one side of things because I grew up that way. These understandings take a lot of listening and thought and studies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh and to comment on other religions, understanding when they began and how really shows a different light to them being right or wrong. But anyways.\n\nThe afterlife. Many people believe that when you die you go to heaven (or hell but no one really says that, may be though in a figure of speech \"go to hell\" etc. but people usually say they are looking down on us in heaven). That is not what the Bible teaches at all. I won't quote full verses; you can look them up if you would like. The Bible teaches that when you die, nothing happens. A person simply goes to the ground and their breath, literally the air they breathe, goes to God, just leaves their body. That is it. Job 14: 11-12; Job 7:9-10; Job 3: 17-19; Psalm 146:4; Ecc 12:7; 1 Thes 4:14-17; Ecc 9: 5-6; 10; Heb 9:27; Psalm 115:17; John 11:11-14;  There are more but that is enough to show what happens when you die. Notice how none of them address going to heaven or going to hell.\n\nThen they are \"asleep\" (because one day they will wake up) and wake up to the resurrection day, whether it be to life or to death. You can read some of that here- 1 Thes 4: 14-17; Rev 20 (the entire chapter). When Jesus comes back for His children to take them to heaven, the dead in Christ will wake up and be taken up with Him and then those living go. Those who are not His children are killed by the brightness of His glory. (This is just me but I understand it by how pure and holy His glory is, that nothing defiled can live in it. ) So then for 1000 years there is a judgement taking place so that everyone of God's children can see why they are in heaven or why someone they loved/ knew didn't make it. Everyone's life is open to be reviewed so that we can know and understand that God is just and loving.\n\nAfterward, He brings us back to the earth with the holy city, and satan has his last attempted at deceiving the people and provoking them to attack, showing again his true colors, but God protects His children and finally destroys satan and all those who did not make it, but they don't burn forever. The fire goes out and that ends all of their suffering. Malachi 4:1-3 also in revelation 20\n\nThen God creates a new heaven and earth and His people live with Him for eternity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can look at this study here:  https://www.amazingfacts.org/media-library/study-guide/e/4989/t/1-000-years-of-peace)"

Such a simple point and when the theists kept failing to show good reasons to believe in god, using eloquent language to hide logical fallacies it became clear that they have nothing.\nEither way, I am sorry for the hardships of abuse you had to go through.\nThat's also indicative of the non existence of a benevolent being.\nYou were very much raised in a christian background. At school, you were probably taught the christian religion.\nYour surroundinds believed in it and that can have a great influence too.\nLater on you got influenced by it again.\nHowever, it seems that your reasons are emotional instead of rational.\nIn any case, maybe you personally didn't believe because of where you were born but the overwhelming majority, that's why they believe.\n\n\nI wonder what you will make of your great dishonesty of atheists hating god."
