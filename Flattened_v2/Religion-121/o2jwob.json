As a rational being i will try to act in a manner that gets me to a stable marriage."

The official position of anti-gay religions like islam and christianity is that being gay is \"wrong\", and that if you're gay then you're a sinner.  They maintain that god made you correctly, but *you chose* to fuck it up.\n\nIn other words, separating the genders and covering up is to help you resist \"natural\" urges that you're supposed to have.  If you're gay, then your urges are \"unnatural\" and don't deserve help."

I can deal with my wife seeing other men, and she's fine with me seeing all the ladies about.\n\nFinding others attractive will never go away, but I'm committed to my wife and she to me.

It's like a beginner constantly holding the instruction manuals.  Going through the motions does not indicate actual expertise.  The additional effort is, in fact, an indication of the lack of expertise.\n\nAll your thoughts revolve around sex and lust, because mentally you're still focused entirely on sex and lust whenever women are involved.  That seems to be something you have yet to train yourself out of.\n\nI'm not walking on eggshells at the swimming pool because I'm not getting a sexual thrill out of being near women in swimsuits.   I don't stare at women not because I have to remind myself not to, but because I have better things to do, like work out. I don't avoid bumping into women specifically because bumping into men OR women is just rude.  There is no lust involved in the matter.\n\nYou still have that issue.  Not everyone does.

I'm saying that men being attracted to women is a thing. Therefore even if you aren't thinking about fucking someone at the pool, you still should avoid doing anything that resembles even that. Otherwise you're making the other person uncomfortable. I really don't give a crap about anything but swimming.
