I did not completely discount them but I was confident that these people suffered from mental illness or were bored and just wanted to concoct stories and scenarios that people found interesting and fun. I was sure many were liars and exaggerated. I don't want to discuss my personal experiences but I will say this I do not discount these things and the only real proof that you could have is to be possessed or under the control of a telepath or spirits that being said I am sure that it is real."

I would go into it more but you don't want to discuss your persona experiences, which is the only way to look into this farther. In the meantime let me say that the only real proof that you could have that Santa is real is to see him putting presents under your tree."

The phenomenon was witnessed at UBC in Vancouver where I went 94 days without consuming solid food and drank energy drinks, coca cola I also had ginger ale and coffee. 54 days under confinement I am backed up by my claim due to the fact that I did not defecate the whole entire time under observation (it takes time to reach this point where your body does not expel feces it took 40 days) also unless you are acussing me of lying the voice caused me to perform a miracle in front of groups of onlookers numerous times one was summoning rain in front of a group of people weather manipulation they all looked up to see if there was a plane flying overhead or a crane all the people that witnessed that are probably getting mocked and made fun of like you are mocking me. I don't mind the truth is the truth and it is that which I always stand for no matter how ridiculous it sounds."

I gave a ridiculous example to demonstrate that the argument was ridiculous, not that you or your experience is ridiculous and you should not be mocked. I apologize for coming across in that way.\n\nThank you for sharing your experience. May I ask a few questions regarding it. You said you did not eat solid food for 94 days, right? You say the miracle you performed was to summon rain. How did you do that? The group of people watching, were they part of this 94 day fast as well?"

How did you rule out the often hallucinatory effects of being undernourished?\n\nNot to discount your claim of a miracle, but do you find the claim that it will rain to be extraordinary? My mother is very good at knowing when it will rain. Before rain, she will often say, \"it's going to rain\" and soon after, it will. But there is nothing miraculous about that claim. Without any other information, how would you explain how my mother often knows it will rain before it does?"
