Even things like the Exodus were ongoing miracles, and so it's hard to argue historically about an event where God was feeding the people each day. Things like questions to the size of the Exodus? Sure."

    "text": "Right, but my point is that when you said this:\n\n>So you should not be surprised when Christians point to the very many things in the Bible that have been confirmed by archeology and history, and not surprised that historians don't engage on the miracles\n\nThat seems to be either misunderstanding or misrepresenting the op, because op is addressing  the fact that some religious people point to *some* things confirmed by history, but ignore the fact that for many other verifiable Bible claims (ie non miraculous), the historical consensus goes against those claims. And the op gave several non miraculous examples that effect.\n\nSo, should we be surprised when some religious people pick and choose when historical confirmation is important or not?"

    "text": "Literally, the one miracle mentioned, but your treatment of it as the entirety of the argument is exactly the OPs problem with how Christians handle evidence and expertise with relation to the Bible.\n\nAND more importantly- such a historical event would have been recorded by historians. If comets and their appearance find their way into history, I think the sun and moon standing still would leave its mark on history- you're not even acknowledging the extent of the argument, you're creating a strawman.\n\nFurthermore, while historians may not deal with miracles of this type, science does, and we know the effect the sun standing still would have- and there is no evidence for that."

So...I am not actually \"factually wrong\". As far as I can tell you've completely misread the OP. Especially considering that he linked the counter argument that shows those narratives are not supported by historians. The only counter argument he didn't present was the sun standing still- which is the only point you tried to argue against. He could have left that point out, and the purpose and development of his point would still be clear. You chose not to engage with anything but the one point that wasn't necessary for his argument.\n\nYou're not actually addressing the point the OP presented. You're literally ignoring it to argue a strawman. Which is rude. I tried to point it out as simply as I could. You continued to ignore the point and argue the strawman, in a debate sub. I understand you're a mod, but you're not engaging in proper debate- and that's why I have been downvoting you.\n\n>An image of something that isn't there is a miracle.\n\nOr it could just be a painting. Or a giant statue. Or literary misrepresentation of the reality of the moment. None of which meet the definition of a miracle- I can speculate too, it's fun."

Which doesn't address the point the OP made. It focuses on a small section of the OPs point.\n\n>Except I'm not strawmanning. And you are literally here trying to erase one of the examples that made my point for me - so that I will strawman him? This is ridiculously bad behavior on your part.\n\nYou are strawmanning. If you weren't you would have separated the Joshua comment and make your claim about it separately- which is to point out that historians can't use natural methodologies to validate miracles. But instead you conflated one point amongst many and argued it as if it was his only point. I am not erasing an example, I am saying that the OP isn't referring to miracles- your argument is based on that claim and your understanding that there can't be empirical evidence for them.\n\nI disagree with that claim, and therefore disagree that it is apropos; however, I didn't intend to argue with you about it.\n\n>All of the examples in the first paragraph were attributed to historians by the OP. So you are factually wrong.\n\nIt's your claim that historians can't validate miracles, not the OPs. You think there are miracles that can't leave empirical evidence, but the only reason you know about the miracles is because someone wrote about it- and you're giving more weight to that writing despite the origin of the source being uncertain.\n\nHistorians can validate events that don't leave explicit archeological evidence. The actual refutation to that point is that just because something hasn't been validated yet, doesn't mean it won't be. Stopping of the sun and moon should have left evidence- historians may never find that evidence. That is completely different than your point though.\n\nI am acknowledging that you believe what you claim, but I was not focused on what you claim. I was focused on your handling of the point brought up by the OP."
