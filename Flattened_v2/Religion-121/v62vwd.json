You only go to Hell if you know it's the correct religion but then ignore it. Does this apply to you?\n\nIf yes, then it's ignorance. If no, then you're going heaven mate, just be a good Samaritan :)"

The moon never split, sperm doesn’t generate from the lower back, and mountains don’t hold the ground down, just for instance.\n\nIf the quran is true then we know that allah hardens the hearts of certain people so that they will never believe; those people will also go to hell. How is that merciful?"

I’m sure you make many good-faith arguments on here with that kind of attitude, lol."
