I had similar thoughts to your last line in the days  or weeks before God saved me, out of the blue, out of the darkness, into His glorious light.\n\nGod can't help but be the greatest. It's not a sin for the champions to sing, \"We are the champions.\" It's not wrong for the greatest to be the greatest.\n\nGod promotes Himself because it is right and He is the best thing for us.\n\nGod orchestrated the fall of Lucifer and the fall of man so His myriad attributes would all be on display, for His great glory and our joy to witness and worship them."

Who supports that?\n\nDo you think this absolves the earlier monstrosities you mentioned? This is just another on the pile. Imagine that for a moment, torturing people literally forever is just another evil on the pile of this monster you worship. What the fuck man?"

Your depraved monstrosity of a deity literally made us to torture.\n\nHe's so \"amazingly full of grace\" that he maybe won't torture us for all eternity if we bow low enough and believe the correct unbelievable, unfalsifiable story out of an infinite list of equally unbelievable and unfalsifiable stories.\n\nHow much of your humanity do you have to abandon to think this horrific creature is good in any way?"

    "text": "Nope, that's now how calvinism works. We don't know who is elect or not, so what matters in this present moment is if you want to believe or not. If you want to, believe, or humble yourself and cry out to God until He grants you the gift of faith. (He promises to do so.)\n\nIf it does indeed turn out that you are not elect, then yes you were made for dishonorable use, but still for God's glory.\n\nThose who see the glory of God wish to glory Him in Heaven (grace) or hell (justice) which they deserve."
