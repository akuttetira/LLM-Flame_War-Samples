Fact is, it is very rare for an election to be decided by one vote.\n\nThe best argument for voting is by analogy to recycling. Globally speaking, the environment is impacted almost not at all by your choice to recycle. But you recycle anyway, because you're smart enough to understand that the choices of many people to recycle can make a difference. Same applies to voting.\n\nNot voting is as irresponsible as not recycling."

However, I agree with you that this year will probably be different given the circumstances\n\nFrom the article I linked:\n\nThey found that in presidential and midterm general elections between 1996 and 2018, switching to all-mail voting increased the percentage of residents who voted by 1.8% to 2.9%, they report today in Science Advances. **When it came to the Democratic share of the vote, they found a tiny uptick in the share of votes that went to Democratic candidates for Congress, governor, and president—approximately 0.7%.** But the difference was so small that the margin of statistical error means it’s possible there was no effect at all, Holbein says.\n\nThe new results mirror work published in June by researchers from Stanford University. In that study, scientists looked for changes in voting as counties in Washington, Utah, and California gradually switched to all-mail ballots in 2006, 2012, and 2018. **They found a negligible partisan impact, with turnout by registered Democrats increasing by just 0.1% relative to Republicans**, they reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nhttps://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/08/do-republicans-or-democrats-benefit-mail-voting-it-turns-out-neither"
