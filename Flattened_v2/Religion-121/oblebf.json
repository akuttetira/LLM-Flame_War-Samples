I get that people suffer from a \"since it's like this today, it was like this in the past and will be like this forever\" syndrome, but that's just not reality. .\n\nWorldwide spread happened during Christianity's colonial era, and was limited to places that were already weak, or weakened thanks to massive mortality caused by diseases Europeans brought with them. China, India, Japan were never converted. South Korea was (it's now 1/3 Christian) but they seem to be moving toward the type of irreligion that characterizes other first world nations.\n\nI guess I've never understood this way of thinking :/"

Seriously how often do you go to an apologetic site and see\n\nMy religion is true on the basis its popular.\n\nThe Op is just  going after low hanging fruit that  neither side really argues.  this is weak especially  for Christians whose scriptures concede their faith is not the most popular way of life.\n\n>“Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, **and those who find it are few**.  Matthew 7:13\n\nHowever if  Christianity was not worldwide and under a 100,000 believed  then skeptics would  claim  its proof its false since a powerful loving god would have been effective at reaching more people.  We all know this is true  even if  anyone is not honest enough to admit it. You skeptics like to eat your cake and have it."

With Billions of Christians, Muslism and Jews I suppose you could find a few people saying anything but to pretend like its some central popular point  requires  documented examples  not anecdotal claims like \"I've heard plenty of people\" which no one can verify objectively.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>in that if there were a god which made itself known to everyone, leaving free will intact (think Jesus in Judea) then the only thing that would matter is what an individual chose to do with that fact. Since the existence of the god would be a given\n\nand thats precisely why the atheist argument makes no sense because most of the world precisely thinks the existence of a God or higher power is a given.  so they look at reality and see an evidence that atheists reject under  \"\"what an individual chooses to do with it\". One option being reject it as atheist do\n\nso your argument is  self contradicting.  a person could always choose to reject  the evidence as the atheist does. The next come back of an atheist is  to say there is no evidence at all so 90% of the world is open to a God or higher power for no reason at all -  Which is an extraordinary claim that requires some evidence itself.\n\nWhat the atheist really means is  -0nly what I accept as evidence is evidence and since I don't accept theism there is no evidence for it. Which is just self serving drivel not reasonable logic."

For me, that says nothing about the truth/falsity of belief.\n\nNote the 90% don't all worship the same god. There isn't agreement even within religions on the nature and demands of their god, as there isn't evidence for any of these belief systems.\n\nThis poses a problem only if you believe that there's one god who will punish people for failing to worship it, cuz you'd expect that entity, more than any of the others, to make its presence clear, giving people a real choice. One such god did it--think Jesus, miracling his way thru Judea."

You are dishonestly  switching in order to  hide the fact that you can't  present any real evidence for your claim that popularity is a common  claim of christians for why their religion is true. Read the quote again and if the difference between evidence and proof has you stumped look at a few dictionaries. I wrote this\n\n>...the next come back of an atheist is to say there is **no evidence at all** so 90% of the world is open to a God or higher power for no reason at all - Which is an extraordinary claim that requires some evidence itself.\n\nThis sub either has a great deal of non adults or the education system has really let down a number of you.   Thats not saying a religion is true because  its popular.  It questions  the claim that  there is no evidence whatsoever as many juvenile atheists state.  Something can have evidence but still not be true.  a guilty man can have evidence of his innocence  ( happens in most trials or the defense would have nothing to offer) and still be guilty.   In science its the same . You can have  some evidence  for a a few different hypotheses  but the preponderance of all the evidence  leads you to reach the conclusion only one is true  - the rest had some evidence but were not proven true\n\nSo you can stop with the dishonest lazy tactic to cover over for the fact you have no evidence popularity by itself is a common apologetic in Christianity that  we say proves our religion is true . I have never made such an argument anywhere so your attempt to use me  was a flop and you still have nothing.\n\n>Note the 90% don't all worship the same god.\n\nIrrelevant.   You exist in some sense and  people  can have different names and different opinions about you.  This is always a silly  argument made by atheists.   If we  find an alien aircraft in space,  that aliens exist , will be the headline not the name  we call them or  the various opinion of what we think of them.\n\n>as there isn't evidence for any of these belief systems.\n\nOf course there is - you  are just ignorant of the words you use and conflate   proof with evidence.\n\n>Evidence is anything that you see, experience, read, or are told that causes you to believe that something is true or has really happened.[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/evidence](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/evidence)\n\nand proof\n\n>Proof is a fact, argument, or piece of evidence showing that something is definitely true or definitely exists.[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/proof](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/proof)\n\nyou can have evidence of  something and it turn out to not be true ( the person last seen  coming out of the deceased house is evidence of their guilt but not proof because other evidence can  show someone else  got in and left without being  seen) and in many  cases you need multiple evidence to consider something proven.\n\nThe barf that there is no evidence  at all is usually made by atheists  to imply the idea of God is completely irrational  and is taken with no reason ( regardless of whether its right or wrong).\n\nI've yet to meet a theist that doesn't have a reason or doesn't point to evidence. the shtick of the atheists then is to deny its evidence  as i  already explained here.\n\n>What the atheist really means is -0nly what I accept as evidence is evidence and since I don't accept theism there is no evidence for it. Which is just self serving drivel not reasonable logic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>to make its presence clear,\n\nsomething being clear is  a mental state. since there are   more people who find God's presence  clear   in order to show its not clear would need something more than a claim its not by the minority.  Again this is not an issue of proving based on popularity but  on whether you can make the claim something is not clear merely because you deem it nor clear"
