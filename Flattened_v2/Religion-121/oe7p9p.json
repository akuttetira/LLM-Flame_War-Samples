People here mostly atheist, so you will get upvote.

But you don't need act like you are being attacked, nobody is going to fall for that little trick. Everyone gets embarrassed. I get embarrassed, every human alive gets embarrassed. That doesn't make sense to veiw yourself as being attacked just because you didn't want to defend your position by acting like you didn't even know why you earlier claimed someone was espousing blatant hatred for the Bible.\n\n>Haven't i said earlier that \"not systematic\", \"unconstructiver\", \"bias toward his own believe\" is related to \"blatant hatred\"?\n\nNope.\n\n>Do you really read my text?\n\nYes\n\n>Or you just too defensive with your atheist religion.\n\nWell I'm not an atheist, I'm a Christian. Again, nobody is going to fall for your little tricks, and reflects poorly to accuse me of being an atheist when I confess Christ and am a Christian."
