You shall make no covenant with them nor show mercy to them. Nor shall you make marriages with them. You shall not give your daughter to their son, nor take their daughter for your son. For they will turn your sons away from following Me, to serve other gods; so the anger of the LORD will be aroused against you and destroy you suddenly. But thus you shall deal with them: you shall destroy their altars, and break down their sacred pillars, and cut down their wooden images, and burn their carved images with fire. \"For you are a holy people to the LORD your God; the LORD your God has chosen you to be a people for Himself, a special treasure above all the peoples on the face of the earth."

Secondly, the bible has been rewritten a million times over, I doubt the original text worded it like that. Thirdly, you’re taking it out of context. These are enemies in war, during times of war, not during times of peace, against people who worshipped gods and godesses of sex as well as sacrificing their children and so much more and so much worse, so I ask you again, where’s the mistreatment??"

How misguided are you that you so easily justify genocide?!\n\nGenocide is never correct, especially if the one asking for it is omnipotent and all powerful......."

    "text": "Ok, the first two paragraphs don’t even make any sense.\n\nSecondaly, it’s not genocide, it’s war you you benign, thoughtless idiot.\n\nTake the Aztecs for example. Hernan Cortes‘s hate for the Aztecs began when they showed him how they sacrifice humans and drain their blood to ordain their idols with. Cortes took charge and easily took down the Aztecs with minimum causality. Difference is, Canaanites can fight back just as strongly. They’re not going into villages and bringing them down and killing everyone they stumble upon, but whoever comes against them on the battlefield you fool."
