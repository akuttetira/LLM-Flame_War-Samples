Even though arguably Muhamad preached that the gospels were sent from allah and nobdy can change Allahs words, muslims today and throughout history have denied the christian scriptures as being corrupted.\n\nThe biggest difference is our view on Jesus. Jesus in christianity is divine son of God who is the only way to have forgiveness of sins. Where as in Islam Jesus is just a prophet and to have forgiveness of sins you have to follow and believe in Muhamad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou have to deal with the ideologies and religious doctrine. The taliban are a faithful representation of 7th century Islam, while American slave owners who raped their female slaves are not a faith representation of christianity and I can show biblically why they are going to hell."

If so, how is the OT completely different?\n\nAs far as American slave owners, the Bible is clearly not against slavery.  It even places slavery higher than marriage in Exodus 21, which talks about enslaving fellow Israelites.  There we find that if a Hebrew slave was married while in slavery, he is to go out (free) by himself, leaving his wife and children to his master."

The new and everlasting covenant.  The New Testament--and testament is synonymous with covenant here-explains itself, it explains the transition and where people are at in terms of the ongoing story.  They are in the final act, as witnessed by the NT writers.  This is why they speak of the remainder of time as the last days."

The timing of the ultimate return is left unknown.  The NT, for example in parables, speaks of delay, a need for watchfulness, etc.  All things were accomplished at the cross, the climax.  The rest is denouement and resolution within the narrative.  The purpose of the remainder of time is for the full number of people to come in by faith.  We see all this when we analyze the NT.  Whatever Jesus did not perform or fulfill at his first coming will be completed when he returns.  There, the remainder of prophecy and everything ever said will find ultimate, final fulfillment.  The time in between is the last days.  We see this all throughout the NT."

It seems like it says \"if you can get free, do it...but like...whatever....\"\nThe point of christianity is very much that this life doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things - so why would it matter if you're a slave to a man...you're free in christ...and if you're free in society, dont' think you're so cool because you're a slave to christ...\nit's a nothing sandwitch.\nAlso, this chapter also says that a woman or man cannot refuse sex with their partner - this means that they can be forced to have sex. that's rape.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Ephesians 6 tells masters to treat their slaves in love basically.\n\nEphesians 6 doesn't say to free your slaves, does it?\nSlavery isn't only immoral because of the threat of allowed violance that comes with it. it's immoral because a human being should not be owned as property; that is immoral.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Jesus established male / female monogamy in marriage in matthew 19.\n\nJesus just talked about marriage in here. where does it say that a slave owner cannot have sex with his slave?\neven IF there is a passage that says this, which I'm not aware of, the NT still does nothing to say slavery is immoral."

And I dont think you are saved if you are living in unrepentant sin. So its not inherently sinful to be a slave master. But that doesn't mean there arent sins that can stem from a slavery system like kidnapping slaves which bible prohibits as manstealing in both covenants, sexual violations, and doing other evils to your slave.

In the city, the assumption is if she’d have cried out he would have stopped or been stopped - completely ignoring that he might threaten her with violence - and they both are killed; the second is outside the city and even if she yelled out, there’s no one to hear it. But - and here’s the interesting part - all this is dependent on her being betrothed to be married. The next example - the one I brought up - is about a non-betrothed maiden and mentions nothing of her consent because it doesn’t matter as she’s not betrothed. This guy isn’t ruining a soon to be marriage - so he pays the fee to the father and it’s all good. Because the bible doesn’t give a shit about women.\n\nLearn you bible."

As well as if you don’t believe in the OT in its entirety then the NT has no foundation for Jesus’ alleged divinity in fulfilling the covenant.\n\nBoth Christianity and Islam promote Bronze Age thinking, a mystical worldview, and discourage critical thinking. Christianity is not better than Islam. Saying Jesus was some peace-loving martyr is inaccurate. His holy book preaches the same dumb shit as Islam’s."

He came to fulfill the law and bring a sword (rather than peace). He was a warmongering Jew that hated Roman occupation lmao, not some prophetic martyr for your religious redemption.\n\nAnd why wouldn’t you lump Christianity into the same fold as Islam? Both encourage backwards thinking and an outdated view on society. They are the two religions that have caused the most long term damage and repression of science and art to the world. Just because you’re a Xtian doesn’t mean your religion is free from scrutiny to the same degree as others. It is still a violent and evil doctrine"

Not in luke acts or anywhere in the NT did christ followers kill anyone. Its a parable and symbolic. In fact Jesus said his kingdom is not on earth and if it was he would defend it with sword instead of going to the cross. Same cannot be said about Muhamad's offensive Jihad though.\n\n\nAbout slavery 1 corinthians 7:21-23 is all you need to know about slavery. Its obvious a post slavery society is ideal for christian doctrine with scriptures like if you can gain your freedom do so and dont become slaves of human beings. But if you are a slave your duty is to represent christ and bring your master to Jesus through your good works and representing the gospel as a slave which is why the obedience scriptures exist.\n\nLuke 14 is symbolic again. It just basically means if you are a christian and your parents are islam, you got to stand for the gospel, etc.\n\nThere is still a standing command to love, Jesus established hereosexual monogamy as the standard in matthew 19. The same apostle said to love your wife as you love the church. Personally I think the timothy verse applies to women not being church leaders but not applying society in general. Compare christianity with Islam in this video who comes out on top? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NXtIUv5i2w&ab\\_channel=Acts17Apologetics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NXtIUv5i2w&ab_channel=Acts17Apologetics)\n\nAbout the gospel verse they were establishing the word of God so i dont know why its a big deal to condemn anyone preaching a false gospel. It doesnt say go out and kill them, it says let them be under Gods curse."

    "text": "You don’t get just to cherry pick which verses count and which don’t dude\n\nYou cannot discredit one verse about slavery to say “but here it says a post slavery society is ideal yada yada”, the issue is that the Bible contradicts itself all the fucking time. Either way, slavery shouldn’t exist, it is not a slave’s duty to bring his master to christ lmfao. A loving god would not put his people into a slavery situation in the first place.\n\nNot once does the Luke verse mention another religion in hating your parents, and Islam doesn’t come around for another 500 years. If it was talking about other religions, it would likely reference some form of Pagan worship. It is supposed to mean you love god more than your own family, and that it’s better to hate your parents to love god (it isn’t).\n\nHeterosexual monogamy is a dumb standard to live life by in a modern secular society. It’s outdated and not needed in today’s world with the science and technology we have. Why can’t women be church leaders? Do they not deserve a close relationship to serve their duty to your god?\n\nSemantics man. Accursed is essentially wishing harm on them. People thinking for themselves is not something to be cursed for anyway. We should encourage rational thought and debate, not blind faith into something you can’t prove or see at all"
