    "text": "Hi, Muslim here. I believe we have a POV on this as well as this question could just as easily be posed to us despite us believing the sacrificial son was Ismael(as).\n\n1st of all, atheists try to water down all the pertinent details of the matter and end up reducing the issue to, “hear a voice, kill your kids”. If u hear a voice that tells u to slaughter your kids. Don’t do it please. Especially atheists, considering how your morality shifts like the wind.\n\nNow I think I can answer for both Muslims and Christians when I say, if I was in Ibrahim(as) or Ismael(as) or Ishaaq(as) shoes, I would have liked to remain as stead fast as the Prophets were during this test. Why? Well Ibrahim(as) by this point was an old man. He spent an entire lifetime obeying Allah(swt). He would give up his own safety by trusting in Allah(swt) and everytime Allah(swt) protected him and saved him. This isn’t just a voice He is hearing. He is very familiar with Allah(swt). He has a relationship with him and He has been carrying out his commandments through out. He trusts Allah(swt) won’t steer him wrong. This wasn’t the 1st time he was asked to do something that didn’t make sense to him accept that He was merely commanded to do it and He followed through.\n\nHe was asked to destroy the idols of his city. He did that and as a result he was to be thrown in a fire pit. God commanded him to jump in the pit and the pit turned into a pit of soft flowers and he was saved. He was commanded to go to Egypt where his wife was taken from him. He Followed Allah’s (swt) commands and as a result he left Egypt with riches and Hagar along with his wife safely. He asked Gid to show him how God gives life and God asked him to cut a dead bird in four pieces and put them in 4 separate corners. He did that and God brought a butchered dead bird back to life. God asked him to leave his 1st born and the mother of his 1st born in a barren desert valley, Bacca/Mecca. For an old man to finally have a son and have to leave him in a barren desert must have been gut wrenching. But he Obeyed. When he was asked to return to the valley. The valley had been transformed into a little city with Hagar(ra) and Ismael(as) safe.\n\nIf after all this built up of trust and faith, Allah(swt) asks hin to slaughter his teenage child. Why would Ibrahim(as) disobey. He has literally seen Allah(swt) give and take away life. He has seen the miracles, He has seen the results of obeying Allah(swt) and He has seen Allah(swt) paralyze a king. Why would he believe He or his son will not eventually come out of this test safely?\n\nAtheists need to contextualize the matter and not reduce everything to facile arguments designed to only cause shock and outrage."

Muslim societies are really wonderful and people are not trying to escape."

    "text": "Meh, geopolitics and warfare has always been a thing. Ofcourse ppl wouldn’t want to go to the west for better opportunities if the west wasn’t creating terrorists for their interests in their lands. But the moment they arrive,  they try to preserve their values by creating bubble communities specifically because they actually prefer their values and they don’t migrate for the secular values.\n\nAlso you do not take in to account how secularism has led to individualism which has led to west not being able to produce a future workforce, so those immigrants are actually needed by the west to ensure their own societies and economies don’t collapse. West Wouldn’t be accepting immigrants if they didn’t need them\n\nBut none of these complex world issues address atheism’s bestiality problem"

It means their morality doesn’t have much grounding and that can be seen with atheist morality shifting through the decades and changing. Atheists could take on any position and call it a morally upright position like how they are increasingly arguing in favor for bestiality. You seem to be having someone else’s argument with me 😂"

    "text": "Where or when was this great shift in non abrahamic religious morals\n\nWhere is this immoral society of atheists or non abrahamic religions.\n\nIf atheists lack any grounding to their morals , why don’t we see that in action.\n\nYour ideas have been taught to you as things that may happen if someone does not follow your religion, but the facts show it’s a lie. It does not happen in practice. You have no evidence, just idle words.\n\nThousands of years of non abrahamic religions , of atheism , of polytheism and yet morality has not changed.\n\nYour claims would make a good argument if they were true, backed with evidence, but the evidence points the exact opposite direction.\n\nHumans over many different geographies have arrived at a set group of common morals such as love your family, help your group, return favors, be brave, defer to authority, be fair, and respect others\n\nhttps://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2019-02-11-seven-moral-rules-found-all-around-world\n\nThis is despite a myriad of religions and other belief systems, wealth , political systems, resource availability etc\n\nIf religion had any role in morality , we would expect to see major moral differences, in action,  between different religious groups.\nWe don’t.\n\nAs such your whole argument is a wishful hope that your morality is better, but it isn’t, just the same as everyone else."

It took enlightenment era thinking to slowly erode away the hold  religious dogma had on the world.\n\nPeople  accepted those awful practices  BECAUSE of religion, not a lack of it and nobody accepts those things and uses the justification that atheism told them it was ok."
