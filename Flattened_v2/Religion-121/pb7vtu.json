For the Christian, that worldview is that Scripture/Bible is the unquestionable authority that is presumed true. For the Muslims, it’s the Koran. For atheists, it’s naturalism.\n\nSo, we all do the same thing, using a different worldview. Why bash Christians for doing something you and everyone else does, too, OP?"

It also doesn't help when you mistranslate prophecy which invalidates your claimant.\n\nThe statistical improbability of guessing the result of 100 d20 rolls is enormous - unless you record the value after the die is rolled.\n\nBut for me, the most noticeable prophecies that haven't come to pass is the age of world peace and everyone knowing the one true god."

So if you believe the story of Genesis and then you begin studying biology and come to understand the theory of evolution, you can still believe in the story of Genesis, but obviously you wouldn't believe it literally."
