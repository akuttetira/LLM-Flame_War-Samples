Sure the whole young earth thing had me on the hook for like 3 or four months solid.  I can see where they are coming from. The narrative around the evolution story is pretty weak, and the evidence you speak of is flawed, but I don’t really care. The Bible isn’t a history book, it’s a guide to salvation."

    "text": "Here you go, from ChatGPT. I asked for an ELI5, just for you:\n\n\"Alright, imagine you're playing with a bunch of marbles on a trampoline. When the trampoline is flat, the marbles just sit there. But when you put a heavy ball in the middle of the trampoline, it creates a dip, right? Now, if you roll another marble near the big ball, what happens? It gets pulled toward the big ball, right? That's because the big ball has made a sort of dent in the trampoline, and the smaller marble rolls down into that dent.\n\nNow, think of space as the trampoline and objects like planets and stars as the heavy balls. These objects create a dent in space, which we call gravity. When something smaller, like a satellite or a person, moves near a big object like a planet, it gets pulled toward it, just like the marble on the trampoline.\n\nThis pulling force is what keeps planets in orbit around stars and moons around planets. It's what makes things fall down when you drop them, and it's what keeps us stuck to the Earth instead of floating off into space. That's the basic idea behind the theory of gravity!\"\n\nBut hey, if you want to argue that evolution is a stronger theory than gravity because we understand it better, I'm cool with that."

There's nothing \"existing\" except the stuff of the universe, doing it's thing. We call it time for convenience, but it's not a separate thing.\n\n\"Distance exists\"\n\nWhat the hell does that mean? Do you mean space?\n\n>The ‘unholy’ trinity of the atheist.\n\nI'm sorry you're confused.\n\n>Eternity, Infinity, and the power that created both.\n\nI'm unaware of any of these things existing. \"Eternity\" is either meaningless or refers to timelessness (also meaningless, so still meaningless) or refers to infinite time, which means you were being redundant.\n\nIn any case, \"eternity\" has some sort of relation to \"time\" and I just mentioned \"infinite time,\" so I'll go ahead and clarify that, so far as we can tell, time has existed, or rather, stuff has been doing things, for 13.7 billion years. No eternities or infinities involved.\n\nI am not aware of anything ever being created, irrespective of your nonsense/redundant word and your weird attribution to infinity.\n\n>I cannot in good conscience be an infinity or eternity denier.\n\nOkay? Well, I can. Well, maybe not denier, but at least a skeptic."

The intimate relationship of energy and light to create matter has long been postulated even before Einstein’s famous equation. The voice that started it all; ‘Let there be light!’. Amazing how correct and completely accurate this all was 4,000 years ago. I think atheists are upset it doesn’t say ‘on the back of a giant turtle’"
