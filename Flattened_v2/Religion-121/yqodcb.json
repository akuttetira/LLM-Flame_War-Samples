I don't believe the \"Universe\" can stand in for statements about God telling a dude to kill his son in the form of a burning bush.\n\nGiven that we know literally no practical real-world information about alleged deities or the mechanisms for their existence, any explanation is more-or-less guesswork, but the headline is: You can't claim a perpetual universe is nonsense while also espousing a perpetual deity. There is nothing about being a \"conscious creator god\" that makes perpetual existence more reasonable. The basic logical and intuitive obstacles to that approach remain in either case, so it's essentially a non-argument against atheism."

God is like a complex explanation when a much simpler one would suffice. How about the singularity created everything?\nAt least we know the singularity existed. The universe was in a condenced hot state and then it expanded. And that's all there is to it."

You're the second atheist in as many days who can't deal with hypothetical scenarios.\n\n>As such whatever you think applies to god without justifying it, also applies to the universe or some other physical cause without any justification required.\n\nNope, doesn't work that way.\n\nFor example, a unicorn doesn't exist (it's a hypothetical) but it is defined as having one corn, sorry horn. It's in the name. So we can know that a pegasus (a similar flying horse with no horn) is not a unicorn, despite not having observed either.\n\nSimilarly, because they do not share all properties, we can know (again without having observed anything) that you cannot simply substitute a pegasus for a unicorn and have the argument still work.\n\n>So which one do you think it is?\n1) god doesn't exist.\n2) A physical cause also explains the universe's origin just as well(if not better)\n\nI don't think either are true.

The relevant part is that not all properties of god are relevant to the discussion, only the ones needed to claim that god must be the first cause.\nBut if the same properties can apply to the universe, then the universe may also be the first cause. Since that is less properties, it is a better choice for first cause(less assumptions, less chance to be wrong)\n\n\n\\>Also irrelevant. Are you uncomfortable with hypotheticals or something?\nNo, are you?\nIt's not irrelevant. God's properties are asserted without justification.\nTheists often call this a definition, in other words, god is defined as having this properties.\nThe universe can also be defined as having these properties or another physical cause having these properties.\nSo if god doesn't need a creator, then the universe doesn't either.\nTheists claim that god doesn't need a creator but the universe does but they never justify it.\nThey say that god is eternal so it must be the first cause.\nThe universe is also eternal. There's no reason why it must not be eternal(or the cosmos, if not the universe).\nThey say god's existence is necessary. The universe's existence may be necessary so you can't say god must be the first cause because his existence is necessary because there may exist some other necessary cause to create the universe.\n\n\n\\>Similarly, because they do not share all properties, we can know (again without having observed anything) that you cannot simply substitute a pegasus for a unicorn and have the argument still work.\n\n\nThat's trivially not true.\nYou say that the only way to fly from A to B is with a unicorn, if unicorns exist.\nI say that's not the only way because pegasus can also fly from A to B.\nYou say but we can't substitute a pegasus for a unicorn and have the argument still work.\nAnd I say of course we can.

If you choose one at random, it's 1/333M that you will choose the president. If you have information, you can go straight to the president and pick him 100% of the time but that's different and I explained that. Probably not as well as I thought?\n\n\n\\>Which is what Occam's Razor actually says.\nMaybe you didn't read everything I said and stopped early?\nYour examples all involve additional information.\nFind one where we know nothing about.\nActually this makes it even less likely for a god cause.\nWe have information about the singularity but not for god.\nOf course that doesn't matter for the hypothetical that god exists and if the definition includes that god is the first cause then trivially if god is assumed to exist, it is the first cause. I guess op should have made the same argument in a different way like whatever is claimed for why god must be the first cause, can also be claimed for other causes(or some other better way).\n\n\nBut if that's all you meant all along, it means you are doing a terrible job explaining your points and you still made mistakes along the way, like claiming you can't substitute A for B because A and B are different.\nBut if they are similar enough for the task at hand, you very much can.\nYou could substitute a notebook with a piece of paper because both can be used to take notes."
