As long as Dr Laura was good at saying mean things to people my mother didn't like she would keep listening. Trump was good at saying mean things to liberals that she didn't like and so she will always support him. Sorry about my grammar, I'm more of a teller than a speller."

We call them doctors for short but they are actually “doctors of medicine” because being a doctor has nothing to do with medicine unless your specialty is medicine. But as long as you have reached the highest levels of knowledge in an area then you are a doctor of it."
