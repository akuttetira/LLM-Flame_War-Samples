If religious organization are no longer tax exempt they will no longer have to follow the requirement in 501(c)(3) that roadblocks them from endorsing political campaigns. We will become just like private businesses and we can now fund any political campaign we want with no roadblocks and can now have churches everywhere telling it's members to support the candidate God wants you to pick. Are you still on board now? Lol"

    "text": "That's fine, churches aren't held to those requirements at the moment anyway. Many churches make a point of daring the tax office to come after them and the FFRF has SUCCESSFULLY sued the IRS to do their job but still no action.\n\nThere shouldn't be a single mention of religion in the law other than to forbid discrimination on the basis thereof. Churches should get no special exemptions for tax, or any other law or regulation. As it is religious organisations are a law unto themselves, being the substandard choice for nearly everything due to swathing exemptions from safety, employee protection, and anything else you can think of. In some places if you drive a bus for the local rleigious institution you don't need to meet the otherwise necessary licensing requirements."

[source](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/president-trump-signs-johnson-amendment-executive-order-limiting-treasury-s-actions)\n\nChurches have no oversight, which is why they are hive of corruption and politicking, damaging to Democracy. Religious organisations are the **last** ones we should consider giving special exemptions for anything to, seein as they are by default a bunch of con artists selling something that doesn't exist for their own purposes.\n\nThere is absolutely no oversight for church 501c3 status. They don't have to go through the same oversight or requirements when setting up, they don't have the ongoing oversight and reporting requirements, and they don't have to refrain from politicking because the laws against it aren't enforced against them."

He's now calling 501s \"communism\" which is funny because he had no problem with \"communism\" until he was getting reported to the IRS.\n\nThat case you're talking about was dismissed because the IRS proved they were doing their job and working on cases the FFRF reported prior to even being taken it court.\n\n>The executive order limits enforcement of the Johnson Amendment or any other adverse action against any individual or religious organization for speaking about moral or political issues from a religious perspective.\n\nSo basically nothing changes. This is the status quo. The treasury department should not take action against a religious organization if the organization hasn't engaged in political campaign intervention. This is a nothing burger. It was just a political stunt by Trump to make his evangelical supporters believe he got rid of the Johnson amendment.\n\nIt's difficult to prove without reasonable doubt that a church is participating in political campaign intervention. Their job is not easy. There's a fine line between this and free speech the IRS has to walk. What many consider a violation is technically not. These things rarely happen. But they do happen. The IRS does follow up on tips and they do take them seriously. IRS agents arent cackling their fingers and laughing like evil villains blatantly allowing churchs to violate the terms like you're painting them to be. They are human beings trying to do the best they can like many of us are. Let's leave the systematic conspiracies to the kooks."

    "text": "So your only examples are 1, not a church, and 2, a guy who didn't have his 501c3 status revoked but **claims** to have given it up himself. Where is the enforcement against any single church? Even the Pulpit Freedom Sunday churches who made a show of breaking the law kept their 501c3 status. You're mad or blind if you think these laws actually apply, they **clearly** do not.\n\n\n> It's difficult to prove without reasonable doubt that a church is participating in political campaign intervention.\n\nIt's not when they fucking record themselves doing it and broadcast it.\n\n[Here](https://www.propublica.org/article/irs-church-nonprofit-endorsements-johnson-amendment) is a recent article on churches flouting the Johnson Amendment restrictions to no repurcussions.\n\n\nThere are effectively no restrictions on churches, which is why these naturally corruption attracting organisations are flat out being forced into being even more corrupt."

The IRS doesn't actually go after any of the churches who break that rule.\n\nI'm also not on board with political donations at all.  I think citizens united went the wrong way, saying that organizations are people and so they should be able to donate to political campaigns.  I don't think people should be able to either.  Politicians, campaigns, and parties should be entirely publicly funded and should be illegal for anyone to give any donations or excessive gifts to a party, campaign, of politician."

    "text": "Jeremiah called Chapter 30 The Restoration of Israel. It's starts,\n\nJeremiah 30:1-3:\n\n>This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord: “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘Write in a book all the words I have spoken to you. The days are coming,’ declares the Lord, ‘when I will bring my people Israel and Judah back from captivity and restore them to the land I gave their ancestors to possess,’ says the Lord.”\n\nThe land the Lord gave our ancestors to possess is Israel. The prophecy says God will spread out the Israelites across nations (11) and bring the Israelites back from captivity and bring them into the land of Israel. And this literally happened. But wait, it gets more weird\n\nJeremiah 30:4-7:\n\n>These are the words the Lord spoke concerning Israel and Judah “This is what the Lord says: “‘Cries of fear are heard—terror, not peace. Ask and see: Can a man bear children? [Then why do I see every strong man with his hands on his stomach like a woman in labor, every face turned deathly pale?](\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ydp2Xq7_d.webp?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium)How awful that day will be! No other will be like it.\nIt will be a time of trouble for Jacob, but he will be delivered out of it.\n\nThe prophecy even says prior to the reunification, there will be a historically horrific event that will happen to the Israelites. That no day would be like it. It depicts pale faces and what sounds like starving men with hands on their stomach like women in labor. This event leads to their deliverance.\n\nGenerally Jews historically lived happy lives in the places they called home prior to the rise of anti-semitism in the late 1800s. It was the rise of anti-semitism that pushed Jews out of their homes to find a new home in Israel. What's incredibly remarkable is that the only way Jews could have build a nation in Israel is because Palestine was under British occupation. If anti-semitism didn't rise until 50 years after it did, the Jews would have never had the opportunity to be build a nation in Palestine because the British empire ended colonization. It had to be a perfect storm of events in this narrow window of time for such a thing to take place."
