You really do avoid any actual addressing of the specific point by attempting to shut down any questioning or  discussion don’t you."

I dont suggest try that argument in a court.\n\nWe're not talking about human courts, we're talking about divine decree. No puny human being is taking God into a court and prosecuting him for giving kids cancer and winning. God owns and knows everything and He can do with His creation what He wills. How can a human seriously claim God did an injustice to some kids who, in the islamic paradigm, would be too busy enjoying paradise completely forgetful of their life with cancer.\n\nand yes, seeing the condition of those less fortunate, whatever that condition may be, is designed to soften your heart and remind you to be grateful for what you have, especially health and to prevent you from being jealous of those with more."

Better and better.\n\nBut let’s just dissect some of the nonsense here.\n\nYour claims.\n\n>How can a human seriously claim God did an injustice to some kids who, in the islamic paradigm, would be too busy enjoying paradise completely forgetful of their life with cancer.\n\n1. Torturing a child is good as long as you are nice to them afterwards…\n\n> seeing the condition of those less fortunate, whatever that condition may be, is designed to soften your heart and remind you to be grateful for what you have\n\n2. Torturing a child is good if it makes someone else grateful they are not being tortured….\n\nDo you ever stop and think about what you are saying? I’m not sure what worse being a sociopath or worshipping someone for being a psychopath."
