    "text": "I live with my Nmom, who is now 80, as her caregiver. My two youngest kids were 8 and 9 back when we initially moved in, as I was newly divorced, both kids were undergoing ABA therapy daily for autism, and my dad was diagnosed with cancer 18 months later. My oldest daughter and son-in-law moved in to my home, which was right next door, but on 30 acres of almonds. My mom, at that time was on oxycontin for a work related accident that she had milked for about 15 years? Give or take. She was not going to give up her Oxys for anything so she always had a pain level of 8-9, hence, Oxycontin. Did I forget to mention that she had been an alcoholic for most of my life? I was 47 then. My daughter's family soon grew to 3 children, my father passed away and the martyr/mom took refuge in the living room, dead center, couch. From the time she opened her eyes around 6:30 am until she shuffled to bed, around 11 pm. That room revolved around her. And she made everyone MISERABLE. Until the day my daughter told me that she was no longer coming over because she was tired of Nana yelling at the kids. MY GRANDCHILDREN. I WAS DONE. I told my mother that the living room was for the LIVING, and she was not living, she was EXISTING. She was now going to stay in her room, where she had a tv. Meals would be brought to her. AND IT WORKED. What narcissist doesn't want to be catered to? A little visit now and then, I even got her a bigger tv, a Fire Stick, a Spotify account for her music. SHE NEVER LEAVES.We even sold the ranch and moved. I gave her the master bedroom. She feels like she is the queen. All her hateful comments are in one room. Locked away. Sigh... I do go visit but I CAN LEAVE. Best thing I ever did."

    "text": "Omg yes my nmom and edad take up the living room. I had to come back home due to health issues and have to stay holed up in my room to avoid them both. The energy in this house makes me sick, you can feel the hatred. Doesn't help me trying to recover but nowhere else to go.\n\nEdit: plus the kitchen and living room are attached and open so anytime I need food I have to deal with nmom right there watching everything I do. Started wearing headphones to ignore her."

The practice is used extensively in education, healthcare, animal training, and business management.’\n\nIt’s commonly used on autistic children, punishing them for.. acting autistic, I guess. It’s goal is pretty much to make autistic kids act neurotypical.\n\nA few sources explain why it’s harmful:\n\nhttps://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/neuroclastic.com/2019/03/28/invisible-abuse-aba-and-the-things-only-autistic-people-can-see/amp/\n\nhttps://www.spectrumnews.org/features/deep-dive/controversy-autisms-common-therapy/\n\nhttps://autisticuk.org/does-aba-harm-autistic-people/"

    "text": "My son and daughter only had 2 years and they were older. He was 8-10 and she was 9-11. Theirs was primarily focused on learning emotions and the socializing. They were homeschooled during their therapy so they didn't have anyone at school with them. I put them back in school after the two years, a private school with smaller class sizes. My daughter has done really well. She was a cheerleader for 3 years in high school. She didn't do it for her senior year. She wanted to have her time to be with her friends and just have fun. She's dated and has an amazing boyfriend right now. My son, who was diagnosed much earlier than his sister, had a rougher time. I moved him out of the private school into our local public high school in the middle of his sophomore year. He's flourished there. He loved public school. He needed a big school setting with lots of kids, more social interaction with lots of different personalities. It was far too limiting at the smaller school for him. He's been in school plays. He is still in touch with a couple of kids from the other school but has made a lot of friends at this school. He's a huge video game player and has a group of friends (all older than him) that he runs tournaments with at our house, they hang out here all weekend, eat our food, and are part of the family. We talk about how when he was little, did he ever imagine that he would have as many friends as he does now, and that when he would watch videos of people playing games on YouTube, did he ever imagine that his games would be on YouTube? He's come so far. Both of them have. But I tell them all the time, and always did, that if they had told me that there was a pill I could have given them to take away their autism, would I have done it? No, because it's made them who they are. I couldn't have one without the other. All their little quirks and sensory issues and likes and dislikes make them THEM.\nBUT... my son and I have had some heavy discussions about a family we know with twin boys who also have autism and how their parents are raising them. We were talking about the boys and my son said that as hard as his childhood was on him, and with everything that he and I went through (his father was involved in none of it and we divorced when they were 6 & 7) he is not sure he is willing to burden his own children with a possible autism diagnosis. Life is never simple."

I’m happy that you’re still supportive of them but I’m speaking from my own experience and the majority of the autistic community has had terrible experiences with it. I think you’re a good mother but I’m just trying to explain to you that overall aba is a harmful practice.\n\n‘Life is never simple’ thank you, as an abuse survivor I never would’ve guessed."

And they would have definitely said so. My oldest daughter was an ABA tutor but that doesn't mean anything. Other than she had much younger children that she worked with and much more lower functioning than my two. I'm really curious about it."

As the parent of two soon to be autistic adults,  if what I submitted them to was harmful in the long run,  then I need to know in the event that my grandchildren may face this and my children are better prepared as parents than I was."
