    "text": "Why every time there is a discussion about the planner community people seem to be shitting on the hobby? It's everyone's prerogative how they choose to spend their time. If someone wants to write \"get coffee\" in a pen in a planner and add a sticker to it, why does it trigger so many negative responses and blown minds?\n\nFrom the top of my head I don't understand Disneybounding, reborn dolls, collecting wine corks, painting nails with elaborate designs and stamping them or whatever or playing DnD, but I would never come to someone and said: \"Hey Kelsie, so you dress up as a princess and go to Disney? Three times a month? And spend money on custom ears, yearly pass AND you have a custom Disney phone case? You know what, that is pretty pathetic and juvenile. Why would not having a regular headband and phone case will be enough? It's a tool of efficiency, not art!\"\n\nJust fairly rude and entitled to judge how people spend their free time and money because YOU don't see a value in it."

All hobbies can seem weird from the outside but if they’re not hurting anyone, why do people care? Sure there are some more mainstream hobbies (like knitting or sports) but if it’s a stress reliever and you enjoy it, have fun!"
