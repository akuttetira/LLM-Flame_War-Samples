    "text": "The issue here isn't how grateful we are about their parenting. The problem is suggesting that your child is ungrateful as a way to get their submission.\n\nIt's natural to feel gratitude when you are loved, or towards someone with a loving attitude towards you. I feel like gratitude is a great way to build intimacy, specially when it's unconditional.\n\nBut a lot of us have experienced unbalanced relationships, where we would give all we had to our parents while receiving neglect in return, at best.\n\nGood deeds as just a form of leverage, being gaslit into thinking that you're ungrateful for a sacrifice that they didn't really make, or simply living your life listening and catering to their need and wants while yours are not even considered.\n\nThis is something that we internalize, and continue neglecting ourselves long after they are gone.\n\nThis post was intended more towards these types of dynamics."

    "text": "The question I was asking was whether or not ingratitude and the idea of \"deserving unconditional love\" can potentially be misguided. The abuse is clearly real, and being grateful for abuse isn't the right frame I'm getting at. I'm thinking gratitude more towards these broken people as human beings themselves longing for love, despite being unable to understand love. I was told by the mod this is being toxic positive because there was an assumption being made that I suggested being grateful towards abusive parenting styles, as if to say I was gaslighting the abuse victims experience."

    "text": "Sure! I agree with you that everyone should know love and be loved. But I also think it gets a bit dicey when talking about \"conditions\" for love. N parents, although incapable of giving genuine love, do love in the only broken way they know how. Of course it is toxic, but I think there is a lot of healing to be had in understanding that they don't even know what love is. I think my point was more about the dangers of thinking unconditional love is deserved. I don't even know what my point was hahah"

    "text": "This comment has been removed because it goes against our rule, \"always assuma context of abuse\". This is a support group for abuse victims, so it's important to remember that - asking somebody to be grateful for an abusive parent is not appropriate, and it's perfectly valid for somebody to not want to dismiss abuse and the hurt it causes. Asking somebody to simply focusing on the positives in a scenario like this is a form of toxic positivity, which isn't very helpful."
