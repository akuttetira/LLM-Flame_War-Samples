It doesn’t mean the child is doing anything wrong. The same way I’m sure there are times you want to lock your door when your kids are home. Sometimes we all just need personal space and quiet time and the lock ensures that.\n\nEdit: Sorry if I misinterpreted your comment.

    "text": "My bio mom lost her mind when she asked me that she hoped my daughter would cut me out of her life like I did her (mom) so that I could feel that pain. I told her if I act like you I hope she does. Because she doesn't deserve the hurt that my mom put me thru. That was the last time we ever spoke 8 years ago. My daughter is 14 still doesn't hate me and we are all ok. But I don't invade her privacy, I don't read every message in her phone and then make fun of her for it, I don't read her diary. As long as we have no concerns then I don't need to know what little boy she is crushing on or anything like that. 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️"

Wait, I was like that bc their abuse made me either lock myself up in my room (apart from meal times) or be out of the house. I‘d actually prefer for kids to have a relationship with me where they actually bother me with what’s going on in their lives and their problems. Shocking to an N, I know!"
