The whole \"spark\" thing makes me wonder what his excuse would have been if he had seen it and not felt it, because after such a huge ordeal going through labour, there's not always a \"spark\". Relief, happiness, lots of things, but not always this immediate spark of love and bonding."

Otherwise, every deadbeat parent would just sign away their rights/responsibilities and leave the State or the remaining parent holding the bill.\n\n\nAdditionally, if a parent ever files for social assistance, the State WILL file for child support on their behalf, regardless of whatever \"contract\" is signed between parents.

So this whole thing about needing to see a baby come out of a vagina for bonding purposes just reeks of bullshit to me. I can't even sniff out the logic in it. On what planet does watching someone else give birth help a person bond with the child being born?\n\nEither STBX is mentally ill, or a liar, or an alien... Or he simply does not know what the word \"bond\" means and is also confused about what the role of a parent is. A lot of people don't really like newborns. That's not really the point of being a father.\n\nI hope we get an update on STBX's jaw hitting the floor when he realizes that he can't just decide for himself what amount of child support is fair. OP is better off without this fucker. He seems... delusional."
