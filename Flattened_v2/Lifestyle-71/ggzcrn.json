    "text": "Her Nmom used buying things as a measure of love. When you’re a kid you can’t buy things and so many people connect that to being unworthy of love. I, personally, have had my parents buy me things I never wanted and then expected to be worshipped because of how expensive those unwanted things were.\n\nWhen any money spent on you is considered a waste by your parents, and any money you spend on them is never enough; it’s fairly easy to see how someone could come to resent money and material goods being valued over homemade presents or other expressions of love.\n\nIf your dad was a mean drunk when you were a kid, would you have a strong opinion on alcohol abuse? If this person hated Communism because of their narcissistic parents would you still correct them on who deserves the blame?\n\nInvalidating someone’s values based on their life experiences is gross. Telling someone who or what is to blame because they mentioned your personal sacred cow isn’t supportive or helpful. It’s like you literally stopped reading when the word “capitalism” was used to admonish OP. Just....gross."

It’s a death by a thousand cuts.\n\nThere are years of our formative lives where bad messages are pounded into our heads and reinforced in pop culture. Being raised by horrible people who weaponize the predominant cultural norms against their children fucks up their children. For you to basically say “stop being so dramatic” is literally the antithesis of the point of this sub."

OP is perfectly within their rights to connect their parent’s horrible behavior to the cultural zeitgeist enabling the worst of that behavior.\n\nYou made this about you. You’ve accused me of ignoring your blanket statement that this is 100% on the parents, and yet you haven’t even acknowledged my points, deflect, and claim victimhood. While I have done my utmost to explain why I had an issue with your initial and subsequent comments.\n\nI was raised by narcissists too, and my life is experience and lessons learned are just as valid as yours. My family and their support system effected how I view people and the society that enabled such people. You are being the dismissive one."
