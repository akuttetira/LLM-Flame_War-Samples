It's better to lay low, hide the masks and hand wash them yourself in hot water. Slip away some detergent or buy your own bottle and keep everything to yourself. Do not share anything with them or let them touch your masks ever. Report them for poisoning regardless of evidence so they have a paper trail."

    "text": "DO NOT DO ANY OF THIS!!!!!!!\n\nAs much as they are shit parents and evil people, do not do this. If they find out it was you, they will make your life worst. Narcs love attention...any attention. All you would be doing is giving them a supply and more interest in messing with you. They will not be angry about this, they be happy and more willing to continue this cycle of attack on you.\n\nNarcs are not human beings. They do not react like human beings. They do not have human empathy. The best you can do is be aware of what they do to you and keep a record of it. Writing down information like dates and what they did (for child services or the police). The best you can do is not give attention, as best as you can until you're out of there. Also make sure anyone that you trust and care about knows your situation and keep them aware about what is going on in your life. Narcs isolate and keep their victims to themselves."

    "text": "Perhaps if they do it again. I would consider this an attack, are you close to being old enough to leave? Do you have any sympathetic family members. You should strongly consider that your parents may cause your death and react accordingly. Also make your account as public and humiliating to them as possible tell your church if they have one, family, friends, even their employeers if possible. Cockroaches like them don't like close inspection and you may find someone sympathetic to your cause. If you can't do any of that then try to make yourself a hidden mask that only you know about, you may not be able to wash it everyday but at least it will do your part in helping to stem the infection."

Beating with stick/ belt or beating with a hot steel spatula thing ( which you use for pancakes I guess, or maybe a iron stick/scale) is not abuse but discipline. So I pretty surely know police won't help unless we provide proof. But I hope they don't bribe the police."

At least report it so it's on record."
