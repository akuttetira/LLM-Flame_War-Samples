Yeah, I heard it when it started and I wasn't especially impressed being already familiar with the medical issues that supposedly she cannot have and most definitely can. Having been told many, many times by internet sleuths that I cannot be dyslexic, or I didn't have a stroke, or my heart is fine - because I spelled things properly for a paragraph or changed how I spelled the same word three times in the same post, or I said I used a trike to go 7 miles in one go sometime in 2019 - I literally give no fucks what armchair experts have to say on the subject.\n\nMy spouse had \\*7 car accidents in 2 years\\* as the passenger in \\*5\\* of them, got hit by someone running a red light in another, and the 7th was some twit fleeing the cops. Wrecked his spine. He gets anxiety attacks from sitting in the passenger seat and will vomit if you make him do it for too long. Shit happens my cat.\n\nThat's a manufactured issue if ever I've seen one.\n\nEveryone is human and all the favourites shall eventually disappoint because the expectations for them are too high, but that controversy was not that disappointing day."

Looks like you’re the same way, passing on a load of narcissistic bullshit to someone you’ve never met when there’s been photographic proof of her EDS symptoms.\n\nYou should try to be a little less like whoever raised you that made you join this subreddit."
