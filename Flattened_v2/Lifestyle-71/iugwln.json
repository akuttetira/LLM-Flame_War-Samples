    "text": "TL;DR: this resonated with me, so I took a brief moment of my day to vent some feelings. Maybe other people that resonate with what was said will benefit from hearing my ramblings.\n\nJeez, if this isn't the truth. Narcissism is contagious too. My mother is narcissistic and trys to enforce all kinds of crazy rules in the household, yet disobeys them herself. She's the type to start a fight about something miniscule and then a week later get caught red handed doing that same thing, yet it's always different when mom does it. What makes it even worse is when your her son and don't have the resources to get away from her. After a few years, it starts to wear you down and eventually you find yourself mimicking behavior to simply stand your ground. My mom constantly teeters from being verbally abusive to a victim, with only enough inbetween to make you avoid her when company is around, and of course she complains about my absence later; she always has. It's taken me a long time to think myself around this kind of stuff. It's very subtle how the thought processes intrude into the way you think when you're on the hurtful end of abuse. It starts with something small that someone points out to make you conscious of and snowballs into you self analyzing your every move, and everyone elses, and making those same assertions that drove you crazy from the start to other people. It's especially toxic when you mix all of that with depression and being stuck in the same household as your abuser. Knit pickings turn into all out screaming wars, the kind where your cute puppies run down stairs and hide in corners, simply out of fear. It's sad, but it gives you a perspective of life that can be suprisingly refreshing once you get past the pain. I'm starting to learn to appreciate the 'neutral' times in life. Boredom is slowly becoming a time I recognize as peace and quiet. And luckily, my hobbies are music and driving. So I can always plug headphones in to get away, or take a drive."

This place is filled with individuals, just like you, that have feelings, understand pain, and spread their beautiful love across this globe. I do my best to not depend on social media to keep my mindset square, but the little dopamine kicks really do improve my mood. It feels good to know I'm not alone. :)"

    "text": "Thank you for the support! :) I'll be okay though. It was very hard on me when I couldn't see things clearly, but I manage much better these days. It's sad, I know, but I was blessed to have an older brother go through it as well. I had the opportunity to observe all the pain he went through and see the hypocrisy before I really had to deal with it on a first hand basis. When my brother moved out, things got harder for me, because I became the target, but I always have my brother as an example to look up to. He's not a perfect person, but his biological mom (my mom is his step mom and who he considers his real mom; long story) abandoned him when he was 4 years old. My dad supported him, and his grandfather, whom was dying of cancer and had no blood relation to my dad, besides being an In-law. My brother's biological mom is a drugged out crack whore and she used to write him letters telling him she was going to come on the weekends to see him; you know what happened. She never showed up, ever, besides the one time she tried to kidnap him and my biological n/mom beat her ass into a pulp in our front yard. That lady went on to fall off a 4 story holiday inn balcony and live to tell the story. She got something like 3, or 4, million dollars in a settlement and never spent as much as a dollar on a birthday card for my brother. She literally smoked herself broke and my brother had to grow up knowing all of that shit, and survive through our household. If he can do all of that, I can make it around my problems. Some people have opinions about my brother; he's been through the ringer more than one. He's overcome a serious heroin addiction he developed in high school. He lives on his own, managed to graduate from college with a double major, and even though he's still figuring life out, he's a hero in his own regards. Life is intriguing, the most terrible situations can bring out the best qualities in people. I hold tight to those thoughts in the moments when it gets hard to move forward and it makes my life easier, even though the circumstances don't change much."

I know that's a terrible thing to say, I really try to make things better for myself, and it helps, but I still have this lingering, decaying feeling inside me that is so hard to keep track of, because my mom's indenial of being BPD, but so many of those things seep into me on a daily basis. Thank you for your comment, it meant a lot to me."

It took me off guard because 1) sucks that I was that way and 2) I didn’t really know what I had been doing differently to instigate that change. It took me a second to realize that I had gone about a year NC with my nDad at that point and I had FINALLY gotten rid of some of the fleas that I picked up from him and being around him."

    "text": "It can be so hard early on, it's quite a confusing situation. One day, you feel bad for thinking you made the narcissistic person in your life feel bad. The next day, they're ok, and your feelings are still lingering, yet that doesn't stop them provoking something new into you. Then for once they finally shut up, but you don't want to be around somebody who is only nice to be around once a week, so you isolate yourself from them and find alternatives to spending time with them. Relationships grow further and further apart, you begin to realize that your happier the further you get away, but that's right when a guilt trip comes about family and family values. And try to explain yourself during one of those, it's impossible with all that anxiety piling on top of already complex emotions. It never just ends there though, the cycle repeats itself over and over and over again, until you start to think you're the crazy one. (Narcissistic people are extremely good at convincing others of this.) Here is an interesting bit though, generally that crazy ass narcissistic person in your life has been through some equally traumatizing shit and they're just a product of someone else's treatment. You HAVE to understand this, or you'll just x said person out of your life completely. Regardless, if my mom is acting narcissistic or not, she does have love in her heart for me. She has a different love language then me and does try to show me love from time to time, she just doesn't listen when I tell her what ways I recieve it best, which is what hurts, because that's all I ask for; her to listen to me. I think she's this way because her parents treated her that way though. My mom grew up with an Apostolic Pentecostal Church Pastor as her father and my grandmother was his right hand, bible wielding woman. If you don't know Apostolic Pentecostals, they don't allow women to cut their hair, forced to wear skirts, any clothes that show off their natural shape are considered to be \"whorey\" and are banned. The men have to cut their hair and stay shaven, however. No shorts, ever. No jewelery outside of a watch and wedding ring for both sexes; it's a crazy cult. Fun fact: I had a really crazy incident happen to me when I was 16 that changed my life and ended up leading me to the church where my grandma attended, before she died. I went on to be baptised in that church, by the Pastor who was a police officer and used that as firepower for Jesus to spark up a conversation about God while I was literally standing infront of my dead Grandma's casket, mourning her death. That's another story though. I got really into the whole thing and had tremendous faith that I had found my calling in life, even preached in the fucking church. What I'm getting at by saying all of that is this; even though you might know some fucked up people that do fucked up things, don't forget they're still people. If everyone wrote me off when I was 16, I wouldn't be here today to tell you how full of shit I was at the time."
