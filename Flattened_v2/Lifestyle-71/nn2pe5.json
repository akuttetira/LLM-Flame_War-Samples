    "text": "You need to understand that the inner critic is in no way a healthy form of self-criticism that allows growth and maturity. It actually does the complete opposite. Especially since the inner critic is an amalgam of vitriol, self-hatred, toxic perfectionism that develops out of a need to survive the horrendous emotional, physical, and psychological abuse that Nparents put their children through. If anything, one of the main keys to overcome the abuse and grow as a person is to diminish this inner critic as much as possible. A task that can take a lifetime to accomplish. Do not confuse the inner critic with healthy self-introspection. Simply put, a person with a healthy childhood is not going to have the harsh inner critic that creates anxiety, panic, and terror at every corner. They’ll actually be able to develop healthy self-criticism that is supported by self-compassion and self-esteem: two key components that are severely lacking in people who grew up with Nparents. To understand this disgusting inner critic within the context of narcissistic abuse, I really recommend reading the book “Complex PTSD” by Pete Walker."

I just want to ask if you looked around at different books before reading this one or somehow fell into this one and just really enjoyed it? I just want to feel good about the purchase and like I'm not making a wrong choice.\n\nThank you in advance for reading and potentially responding"

    "text": "I first read a couple other books on this subject to try to understand the trauma my parents put me through. They were pretty good in explaining what toxic parenthood is but didn’t have too much in way of advice on how to handle the rollercoaster of emotions and all the delayed developments in life that abuse brings. This book was recommended on various threads here in this subreddit and I decided to give it a shot.  Of all the books I read it has been the most helpful. In particular with dealing with upsetting emotional flashbacks. It does hit very heavy and triggered a lot of extremely painful memories, but it also helped me to release a lot of the weight I was carrying. I recommend you take your time reading it and have a highlighter handy because it has tons of information to process. I’m very glad you are getting it and I hope it helps your journey of healing."

    "text": "Awesome, thank you very much for responding. I'm really looking forward to it even though I know it will be difficult and likely painful, but like reading posts and stuff here it usually ends with feeling better. I actually saw someone else mention the same author shortly afterwards and thought it might have been you for a second, but I'm pretty sure that was someone else so it does seem very promising, alongside good reviews. I will keep in mind the advice of going slowly and taking notes. Thank you again, and I'm glad to hear it has been so helpful for you too"

    "text": "I am aware of what CPTSD is, I guess I just don't make a distinction between \"some self-criticism\" (note the word some) and \"healthy introspection\" I suffer from it myself, y'all just made a whole lot of assumptions about me and tbh it kinda hurt because this is the first support group I've ever tried to be a part of, downvotes are supposed to be for when a comment is unproductive to the conversation, not just if you disagree with someone, that's just being overly sensitive."

    "text": "We did not make any assumptions about you and I’m sorry if you felt attacked. None of the comments were insults toward you and downvotes are just a part of reddit, don’t take them personally. In any case, it can be extremely beneficial to know the difference, so I just wrote out the distinctions between the inner critic and healthy self-criticism. It sounds like you are having a hard time seeing the difference so I really recommend you read the book. Even if you know what CPTSD is, the book really breaks down how to distinguish that evil inner critic from our actually healthy voices and introspection. It has been a huge help knowing that difference and having the power to shut down that inner critic voice. You can even just visit Pete Walker’s website and he has multiple articles on the subject."
