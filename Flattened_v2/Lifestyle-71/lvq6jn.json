Good on you, OP!"

Harassment is one of those buzzwords used by many and HR has to take it seriously if it really was harassment, which in this case, it’s not, because it’s not repeated, unwelcomed behaviors.\n\nEdit: not sure why I was down voted. No where does it say the coworker claimed “harassment.” I’m making just as much of a conclusion and assumption as the person above me. Also, look up what harassment is before you get pissed that I didn’t exactly validate misinformation."
