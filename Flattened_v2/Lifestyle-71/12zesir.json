I’ve also heard it’s hard to tap trees when it doesn’t freeze as much but you can still get water from them I hear\n\nIt's not hard to tap them, but the sugar concentration in the sap will be less, so you'll need to harvest more, so that when you boil it down, it reaches the sugar concentration necessary to form syrup of any real quality.\n\nYou can also tap basically any tree that produces sufficient sugar to make it worthwhile. Birch sap is a common second choice, to the sugar maple tree for this reason.\n\n~~Sap~~ Sauce - Native Vermonter."

The hardest part, by far, is finding sufficient numbers of trees with sufficient sugar and sap production to make it viable.\n\nThe sugar maple is the gold standard not only for the ratio of sugar to water, but for the sheer quantity of sap stored.\n\nAfter a good fluctuation in temperature, the sap can quite literally [flow](https://youtu.be/tvWMdF0QkKA?t=261) out of the tree."

    "text": "Sort of…\n\n[I use this recipe as a general guideline.](https://itdoesnttastelikechicken.com/vegan-baloney-bologna/)\n\nMods are as follows:\nSub regular paprika for the smoked paprika since I’m smoking it myself anyway. Kick up all the spices except the nutmeg. I go heavy on the garlic and nooch, but that might just be personal taste. Don’t drain the tofu or it gets a little too dry. I just give it a quick pat down.\n\nSmoke around 225°F. Usually a couple hours does the trick. I typically have apple and cherry wood on hand, but I think hickory is the authentic way to do it. OH! You have to steam it before you smoke it or the texture gets weird as hell. Learned that the hard way.\n\nEven without smoking it’s a good recipe. Texture is dead on for what I remember bologna being, but it’s been awhile so don’t hold me to that. You can even pan fry it, if you are into that sort of thing. I grew up on fried bologna sandwiches, so this hits me right in the nostalgia place."

I mean, eating a tree, as in a plant, isn’t really considered weird to anyone.  Eating honey and cow milk and goat milk or dog milk is way more weird than eating <insert literally any plant> milk. Maybe if they said like eating shoe milk or cardboard milk or something that wasn’t considered food. Or like made fun recycling and did something about turning your recyclables into milk or compost into milk then it would have made fun of people who care about the environment AND been not palatable.

So in your view, if someone doesn’t find “got wood?” funny, then they have absolutely no sense of humor and are joyless?  Interesting ….\n\nTruthfully, as a 40 year old female who works around a lot of men, I’ve heard enough of the low level boner jokes to last a lifetime. It’s played out by the time you’re at least 25. Part of humor is saying something that isn’t necessarily expected. Hearing these same jokes over and over is dull. If you’re the kind to chuckle at “smell my finger” jokes then cool for you. I just prefer something I haven’t heard 1,000 times.\n\nAnd judging from the reviews, even the milk drinkers thought it was pretty lame.
