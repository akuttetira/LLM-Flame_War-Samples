(i was born in 1984)\n\nthen again, i DID grow up in FL aka the worst fucking state in the multiverse. so maybe i AM the black sheep in this convo O\\_O\n\nbut EITHER FUCKING WAY, i have nooo idea how you guys thought i was making a pedophilia joke. like, what? this was about children being curious to know about things that they should NOT know about.\n\nJesus H. Christ, Esq. that's ALL this was."
