When I was at college I told my not girlfriend (we liked each other but were not dating...we are married now) that I was not going to be able to get to school till a few days after the semester started because my mom couldn't drive me. She said \"well that's stupid, I'll come get you\". She had a 4 hour drive so the fact that she would take a 30 minute detour to pick me up as well meant the world to me.\n\nEdit: talked to my wife. She was actually already at school. It wasn't just on her way. She just drove an hour to grab me and an hour back. She is awesome."

    "text": "That's so sweet. My gf's and my relationship is the first one I've ever been in that isn't completely one-sided. I'm used to giving everything I have to people and getting nothing in return. I buy gifts, I provide emotional support, I feed them and pay for things, and do so much more. I've never gotten anything back until this girl. She actually says thank you when I do things. She tells me I'm beautiful. She tells me she loves me and buys me the chocolates I like. She has lively discussions with me, and she takes the time and effort to recognize my triggers and avoid them when possible.\n\nIt fills me with so much hope when those of us who have been so traumatized can find someone to help us heal."

    "text": "Haha, sure!\n\nMy parents did not give me a healthy example of what a marriage (or relationship in general) looked like, so it’s no surprise that my first serious relationship at the age of 17 was with a 22 year old guy who was a master of manipulation. He was also heavily addicted to OxyContin when we started dating, but he was honestly so good at lying that I was convinced otherwise. I was totally naive looking back, but for reasons unbeknownst to me still, I was willing to ignore several red flags in the first year of our relationship because, when things weren’t bad, they were great, or at least they seemed great through my rose colored glasses. I would have sworn on my poor grandpas grave at that time that he really did love me despite his actions that continued to prove otherwise. He didn’t really love anyone but himself. Fast forward to 3 years in, and his addiction has caused him to really spiral. By now, he’d cheated on me twice with his ex, and once with a mutual friend (I actually later found out that he forced himself on her when he was black out drunk and she was scared for her life). He had also started throwing things when his temper would flare. Usually, if the anger was directed towards me, he would intentionally break things that he knew had sentimental value to me, or things I had spent hard earned money on. At this point he had moved on from the pain killers after a rough stay in detox to drinking about a fifth of vodka a day and god only knows how many milligrams of whatever benzo he could get his hands on. This was a lot harder to hide and we fought constantly over the lying and the fact that he wasn’t able to keep a job to save his life. Somehow, I was still convinced that I could “fix” him. If only I could make him happy enough, he would be satisfied with me and put down the substances. At the same time, I was terrified of just leaving him because of suicide threats every time the subject was broached. He became so controlling that I soon felt like I was a hostage with Stockholm syndrome. I had no friends, and he would even get jealous if I wanted to spend time with my own family without him. Then, he got me pregnant. I wanted an abortion. He refused and convinced me to marry him. Empty promises about stepping up to be the husband and father that our baby and I needed. I wanted to believe it, so I went through with it. 5 months into my pregnancy, he pushed me down a set of 5 stairs on our front porch and kicked me repeatedly in the stomach/groin area. Our neighbors saw and called the police. I didn’t press charges. I had a miscarriage 12 hours later. It was the first time he had gotten physically violent with me and it wasn’t the last. I ended up pregnant again, delivered an amazing baby boy, and finally left him when he was about 2 months old. The night I left, he nearly killed me by strangulation. I filed for divorce, it was ugly, but after a year of nonsense it was done. He ended up overdosing on fentanyl 2 years later and passed away in the hospital after 3 weeks on a ventilator. I’m still in therapy for all of this.\n\nI’m sorry this is so damn long, but that is why I pretty much gave up after 6 years of misery, constant stress, fear, paranoia, and detrimental damage to my self worth. I had one relationship after that and ended up completely self sabotaging it. I just hadn’t done the work to be able to trust someone with my heart and time, and most importantly my son. BUT, now I’m 28 (today is my birthday actually lol) and I’ve been dating a wonderful human being since March whom I absolutely adore. I have never been treated with such kindness, respect, compassion, patience, you name it. I almost wanna pinch myself sometimes. He’s the most caring and selfless person I’ve ever known and has even opened my mind up to the idea of marriage again (which I completely swore off after the first one lol) so that is saying a lot! He also has a precious 4 year old daughter and I love her like my own, and my kid loves her too. It may sound like sunshine and rainbows and I swear most of the time it is, but when we actually have had a problem that needed to be addressed, it was handled in such a way that I actually felt heard. Ya know, like mature adults handle conflict. There’s no yelling. Just honesty and a willingness to listen to each other’s side and feelings.\n\nSo yes, sorry for the long ass reply, but the TLDR is that I finally have someone in my life that makes me want to be the best version of myself and all of the cheesy cliches you can think of. Oh, and if I forget to do the dishes when I’ve said I’d do them, I don’t have to worry about my favorite glass hookah getting smashed in the street! :D Also, no more black eyes is a plus. I don’t spend near as much money on concealer lol\n\nEdit: sorry if that last bit was insensitive to any other abuse victims, dark humor is a major coping skill of mine still. Oops"

I’m grateful though, because I tend to shower my 5 year old with positive affirmations and “I love you”s whenever possible."

I didn't offer to help with anything because in my family we had to do everything for our parents, then we were allowed to take care of ourselves, and then we were able to have time to enjoy things. Her family on the other hand works under the philosophy of everyone helps everyone so I appeared lazy to them. It took me a while to trust it but now I fully embrace it and I get along very well with them."

    "text": "So, just because that was the way it was structured in my family didn't mean that I felt like it was right. Basically, because we were inferior to my parents so we were the ones who had to do the labor. I felt like it was everyone's own responsibility to take care of themselves (idk if you have watched avatar the last airbender, but I was a lot like toph when she first joined the team). After a long time I started to understand that it wasn't just that I was expected to help them, it was that there was a family expectation that we all help each other. This blew my mind because my mom and dad would just bail on packing, unpacking, household chores, etc."
