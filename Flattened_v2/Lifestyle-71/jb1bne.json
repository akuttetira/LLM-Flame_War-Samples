    "text": "Yeah, well, that I know. The thing is that they don't judge me for the things I say. We're not talking about me going to them to talk, this is a private twitter where I have people I know irl in and some other people that I consider friends. Not best friends, but friends. So I'll be vagueing and shit and they'll come through trying to reach out like 'is it your dad again' and depending on how upset I am and who they are, I may not even reply. Sometimes I bother correcting them, again, depending on what happened or what I'm upset about, others I just say 'father, not dad' and they'll go like 'right' and for a bit it seems like they've got the message but then they don't. I don't want to have to explain why this triggers me in detail. They're not bad people, they just I don't know, they don't get it and as many people in this comment section have said, it is interchangeable for the average English speaker and I do know that. Non-bilingual speakers of English have a hard time getting it for the most part and honestly I'm just tired. If I'm not extremely angry or upset, I'll correct it, if I am I'll just say nothing. Sorry for the long reply. Some commenter upset me."

I just don’t think it should be hard for people to respect your request even if they use the words interchangeably. To me it’s like using the right pronouns a person requests - you make the effort to get it right so you don’t hurt the person you’re talking to."

    "text": "No worries, you're good. Well, it's on them. I'm sure it's not to further aggravate me but what can I say? Not much. The bit about the pronouns... yeah that's a whole can of worms as well because I'm NBmasc and hormonal intersex but I don't mind pronouns much (something I got from living in a Portuguese-speaking context. I had to just suck it up) but I have a friend who's a bit of an airhead and always uses my assigned gender's pronouns which is frankly baffling because she has other gender non-conforming and trans friends so I really don't get it. She knows I'm NBmasc also. She's a good friend, really but... an airhead."

I tell them it's upsetting, they say they understand, then they probably forget about it (I'm willing to take that as the actual reason they don't respect this boundary) and all I do is stop talking. That of course, if I'm especially upset and unable to deal with having to go through that because it feels stupid to say it every time. Depending on what happened, I may bother correcting it and risk having them go all 'Oh yeah right sorry' which is frankly annoying when you're already annoyed. I know it's hard for them. I don't want the world to change for me. I don't think anybody owes me shit. That's why I just walk off when people step on my boundaries too much. It's their gain for not having to deal with me anymore and mine for not being stepped on anymore."

I believe that it s what a good friend should do. we arent talking about random people on the street or acquittance, we are talking about people that should be caring for him. so I respectfully disagree with you and believe that it s something that they should be doing because the author of this post is struggling while his friends arent struggling and if they care as friend supposed to, then they should be doing things to ease their friend's discomfort, to offer support, or at least not to add to it, instead of their struggling friends to make that his other friends feel at ease while he keep struggling alone.\n\nthe only acceptable situation here is if their friends can't do it because for whatever reason,  if they are not able to do it, or if they need time to do it , but then they need to warn their friend that they are working on to making the habit and need time."
