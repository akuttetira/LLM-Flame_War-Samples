More importantly, I meant the meaning that OP was trying to convey with giving flowers upon her daughter getting her period, daughter might have liked the flowers but didn’t get the meaning (and probably for the best); hot chocolate, Legos or a arts and crafts set, or whatever else that daughter might have genuinely appreciated, would have been way more meaningful and joyful for a 8-year old and taken the seriousness out of something which should be perfectly normal and not worth making a big fuss about. Mother was projecting her feelings rather than thinking of her daughter’s (not in a bad way), and gave flowers accordingly."

How does blood coming from your vagina mean you can't be carefree?\n\n>you have hygiene chores and need to keep track of time and period supplies.\n\nIt's really not that difficult to put in a new pad when yours gets full. As for keeping track of supplies that is the parents job. The child does not have a job. The child does not have a debit card. The child does not have a car. The adult is the one who needs to go to the store and purchase these supplies.\n\nGiving a period any kind of value judgment, positive or negative, is extremely weird to me.

Literally no one in my life ever told me ‘you’re going to be a woman soon’ - but it’s possible that bloody underwear can be startling the first time, even if you’re educated. My mom’s hug and support made the blood not scary. Seeing blood on my underwear *was not normal for me* and even though I knew it was coming, I was young and needed some reassurance. Why are you making that sound like a toxic thing for a child to need?\n\nPuberty is something that needs to be discussed for both genders? Why are you making this a thing rooted in sexism? My partner has told me about his dad explaining to him how to properly wash his genitals. He had the same experience with new body hair growing in that I did. Children *need* to learn about their changing bodies and how to look after them. There is nothing wrong with a parent supporting their child through transitions, ‘firsts’, etc.\n\nI’m going to stop replying now. This is too much lol. You’re mad about flowers, comrade. Accept that perhaps the majority of people put less stock into plants than you do. You don’t need to buy your kid anything and no one is telling you to. You don’t have to like flowers.
