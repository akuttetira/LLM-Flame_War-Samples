This is the same grandma that fucked up my dad so badly he actually parented as many of the actual narcisist parents described here. He's not a true narcisist, and while he never did a single dad-thing and pretty much only made us miserable with constant verbal abuse, he never did something like what OP described here. He'd just straight up say our mom would take care of stuff like bithdays, and she did. He still loved to ruin the party with a monologue about what worthless shitty children we were though. Took me years to understand why friends never wanted to play at our house, because they werent spared either.\n\nHowever, I have a suspicion that my friend's mom knew what was going on and provided me with a safe haven. My brother and sister were welcome there too. And before you go nuts and say she should have done more, this is actually the most anybody ever did for us where it concerns my father's \"parenting style\".  She never did say anything, I think because its inadvisable to shit on some kid's parents as an adult. I just suspect. I was so welcome there, it still baffles me sometimes. I never felt wanted or welcome at home. It made me terribly shy, even anxious, towards the parents of other kids."

He was an unwanted child to a 16 year old mother in the seventies who was abandoned by her family because of his existence. She in turn was terribly abused by her father and brother, throughout her life before being kicked to the curb with a premature baby. Why she didn't give him up, I'll never know,  she's dead. That entire side of the family is toxic. Even I was toxic as a kid, because that behaviour was considered normal in the family. Thats was just the way we comnunicated, I didn't know any different, just like my father.\n\nThankfully my lightbulb turned on somewhere around the age of 10 and I realised I did not want to make others miserable, the exact opposite in fact, I feel a staggering need to take other people's pain away when they are hurting. Because I know what its like to hurt so badly in an emotional sense it becomes physical. Took some stumbling and some fuck ups, but I'm pretty sure I'm not toxic anymore. I hope..."

My sister is the golden child and until just recently, almost 15 years after my narcissistic parents last attack on me and I left home at 24, she didn’t realize how bad things were for me. She saw my mother beat me for hours and lock me up in a room to only later kiss my step-father’s feet as an apology for telling my sister I was her half sibling 10 years after my mother scared me into never mentioning this fact again. I was 21 then and it wasn’t till I was 33 that she finally realize what had been going on and the parts she played in it.\n\nSo no, it doesn’t matter the age, it rather matters the maturity level of the golden child. And unfortunately that only happens after that child has had the same experience and learnt firsthand what the scapegoat has been going through.\n\nTrust me, narcissism is a demonic mental illness. It doesn’t go down easily. And everyone involved in it is scared by it no matter their age. In fact, the younger they are the worse the long term effects.\n\nSo please call CPS and the police, if you live in the states, and leave ASAP. You are old enough that you may not get put into foster care but rather something worse. So find family or a friend who will let you stay while you finish school. Go to university, find means of getting the money for it and go. That is the foundation you need to get as far away from this illness as possible. Also find affordable therapy, you need it. But yeah, definitely take pictures of the bruises and make sure you file a case against your parents with the police. Even if they don’t take you seriously, make sure it’s on record for later use. You know your parents and you know how easily this could be turned on you to make you seem crazy.\n\nYou’ll be fine. I was you once and today at age 36 I’m finally getting my life back. I don’t doubt that there are others like me so you can be sure that your recovery will be faster. I didn’t have all these resources and stories to help me when I was trying to heal. I didn’t even know what I was experiencing so you are mikes ahead of me already. So don’t let my age scare you. I believe very strongly that you’ll recover faster."

The brother will most likely lie on their behalf, so even with pictures, with no witnesses, there might be no case. Since you weren't hit before, there's probably no record of abuse or anything like that. Even if your parents aren't as bad as mine which they probably aren't, it is unlikely CPS is going to do much in this situation even without COVID. The most that will probably happen is that you will succeed in pissing your father off even more. My personal advice would be to wait until age 18, make sure you have birth certificate, drivers' license or state ID card, then leave that day and go full NC. Look up shelters in your area or talk to friends and have everything ready for that day. And in the meantime just lay low, and maybe avoid the brother. Also google the grey rock method."

I was 16 at the time. The drugs zombified me and severely affected my motor skills, so I quit cold turkey. My mom was so upset, said that \"they made you so nice to your mommy\", referring to herself in the third person included.\n\n\nIt was one of the things that really fucked with my ability to seek medical help for my MDD, C-PTSD, and general anxiety, because I was terrified of being drugged into silence again.\n\n\nI'd also had a social worker that visited me at school twice a month after my parents' divorce.

    "text": "Thats a little black and white. In this case, yeah, clearly. But not always. It's easy to see an abuser as evil, because of what they do, especially if he is a parent abusing his kid. And if he's a narc, there simply isnt a cure or solution, narcs are friggin impossible to work with. So dont bother with them.\n\nVictimblaming is the absolute LAST thing we should do, I agree with that.\n\nI'm just trying to say that abuse has many forms and the people involved arent simply the good guy and the bad guy.\n\nFor example: If there is a couple where one abuses the other, BOTH of them need help and tools to change this downward spiralling pattern. The abuser won't change on his own, perhaps you dont even want to bother with them. But in my experience, most people who suffer abuse want the abuse to stop, but not the relationship. This is why children of abusive parents often remain loyal to some degree. I am one of those children.\n\nMy dad was an awful father and systematically destroyed my confidence and self image, and yet, I cannot bear the thought of severing all ties. Its not as simple as it sounds. Even though I am still damaged by it 10 years after leaving home."

But assault is a crime, and the criminal is responsible, further the government and society is responsible for mental health.  I don’t feel how we as individuals react should be mandated, but r by n must continue to remind ourselves and each other that pulling blame onto our shoulders isn’t right and isn’t just.  I have to do that for myself every day, and it doesn’t always work."

This is a very unhealthy lifestyle and if it goes on it could possibly end badly. From every parent they will always use outdated ways of punishment. I think its time to show baby boomers, Gen X's and Gen Y's that beating your children just makes the problem worse and can potentially end up bad for the child. Sorry got of topic, anyways talking to your parents about this situation is a good idea\n\nOption #2: Call CPS. Even though you still only have about a year till your an adult, CPS will take you under their wing as you are still a minor. However this is last because I have heard pretty scary stories of people being taken by CPS. However if Option #1 fails, this is your last option...\n\nHey Man I really hope you do get some help. Mabey you should see a therapist to discuss the problems your having, It worked for me when I had depression."

Record what you can, if you are in a one party state. (A state where only one person has to know you are recording anything).  Save as much money as you can, get ready to leave if you must.

I don’t mean to scare people but there are better avenues of getting yourself out of that situation - filing for emancipation at the nearest circuit court or having a trusted relative and or friend apply for temporary guardianship at the circuit court. I went into more detail in my other comment but I agree with OP who commented that CPS will likely not do anything and it can worsen your situation at home. Take photos of the injuries though and if you go the guardianship route definitely have them include that in the petition for emergency guardianship."
