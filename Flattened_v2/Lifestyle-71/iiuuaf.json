    "text": "Thank you so much. I genuinely appreciate that.\n\nMy hope is to see him behind bars, never in a position to hurt other girls again.\n\nBecause of him, I have struggled with maintaining normal, healthy relationships. I can't have a full-time job because of the anxiety and depression his actions directly caused.\n\nI have been in therapy for 6 years now, and I can feel myself growing and healing in every session. I genuinely hope that getting justice will help me continue the process.\n\nI have a case worker who has supported me through this process, and she's encouraging me to write a book after all is said and done. I think that that will help me heal as well, to put my life on paper and share it with the world.\n\nI want to let every victim of abuse know that they are strong, and they deserve justice. They deserve to be heard. Most of all, they deserve love and everything that their abusers have denied them."

Making the world a better place for people who also experience abuse can be a beautiful way to rewrite your own story. You and your brother are also very fortunate to have each other! Do keep us posted!"

    "text": "I really like your post. Thank you for posting it.\n\nI thought I’d offer this perspective: Human pieces of shit who do things like your stepfather did/does are rare. I’m not saying they’re not real and I will say that even one of them existing is too many. But my point is that the vast majority of people aren’t like that. So I hope you’re able to find a high quality person to trust and love. And I’d say the odds are stacked heavily in your favor. Good luck to you."

He's the only person my cats have ever adored the way they do (seriously, one of my cats likes my bf more than the cat likes me). Considering the fact that my cats are typically excellent judges of character, I'm taking this as a good sign."

The hurt certainly doesn't just disappear, and the OP still needs to find a way to process it.\n\nGenerally, there can be a lot of valid reasons for not reporting something immediately. Not everyone can take action right away, but that certainly doesn't mean it's unfair to do so later."

    "text": "Thank you so much. I'm very happy that Canada removed the Statute of Limitations regarding sex crimes recently, so more victims from the past can come forward and bring their abusers and assaulters to justice.\n\nTime passed does not matter. The trauma remains, and so does the need for closure and justice."
