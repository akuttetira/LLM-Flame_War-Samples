    "text": "I don't think this deserves a \"downvote\" because it's part of the conversation and provides the opportunity to highlight some critical observations about how self-serving, deceptive and unapologetic the pathological N Cycle of Abuse is.\n\nFirst, it's the parent's job to be \"the bigger person\" not the child's, especially if that child is a new parent themselves. This Ngma was full-boat N Cycle of Abuse mode from the START. If she wasn't, everything would have gone entirely different and the new mom, new dad and baby would have been priority #1 from the beginning. A wide variety of sleeping arrangements and other arrangements would have been made WELL ahead of time (air mattress, motel, etc...) Instead, true to the N Cycle of Abuse, the Ngma neglected those critical things until she believed it best suited her Nobjectives. Her deceptive intention absolutely was to divide and conquer.\n\nYou will benefit ALOT by understanding the severity of the N Cycle of Abuse. The reason Ngma left in the morning \"without saying goodbye\" wasn't because she was a \"victim\" of anything. Consider the context, consider the REALITY of the situation and you should be able to clearly see that this was yet ANOTHER Nattempt to make it all about her, (just like the \"feigned angel\" middle of the night crying). Leaving like that was another one of Ngma's superficial N Cycle of Abuse methods to attempt to cast shame and provoke a debilitating \"remorse\" reaction out of her targeted victims. She's likely done this to new mom throughout new mom's life and expected new mom to call in the morning begging for her forgiveness, begging to be worthy to be loved by her again, begging to give her another chance as she or others may have done in the past when they were younger or less aware of the N Cycle of Abuse. This behavior and intentions are obvious because it is all part of the closed-loop N Cycle of Abuse which was on full display here.\n\nIt's critical to note that NO non-Nparent would have behaved in this way to their adult child especially their adult child who was a *married new parent.*\n\nThis all could have been an emotionally crippling, devastating attack by Ngma on this couple with devastating consequences for the married couple dynamic as Ngma ABSO-FUCKING-LUTELY, clearly *intended* for it to be. NGma had probably been planning this attack for MONTHS and ABSO-FUCKING-LUTELY expected to take the place of the new dad PERMANENTLY. Many couples have not survived such insidious, \"feigning angel\" attacks like this yet somehow, someway this new mom saw what was happening the whole way through and simply said \"NO.\" Regardless of how \"tough\" new dad may be, he will FOREVER remember when HE was *worth* enough to his *wife* for her to stand up for him and his place in *their* family.\n\nTragically, without awareness and intervention, because of the N Cycle of Abuse, the whole attack will be forgotten by Ngma as it is replaced by others. It likely that N's do what they do because they have tried to kill us."

I strongly disagree with codynw42's opinion but he/she doesn't seem ill-intentioned or toxic to me, so it's a welcome opportunity to debate and learn. I mean, this is what we're in this sub for - to learn about what's healthy and what isn't. And this debate is an opportunity for that, imo."

    "text": "She is genuinely feeling bad! But it's because she has GENUINELY unhealthy boundaries and expectations. So the fact that she's feeling bad because people don't cave to her is on HER! She's the one CREATING her own unhappiness.\n\nThis is about a mom and her newborn. In this situation, mom and newborn come FIRST no questions asked. And obviously the mom wants her husband sleeping next to her.\n\nThis woman had the audacity to want to be a \"help\" yet to aggressively put HERSELF first. In this time, of all times.\n\nIf people have ridiculous expectations to be catered for, and then end up genuinely sad, ashamed, and angry because their environment refuses to cave for them, their feelings are THEIR responsibility, not the other person's (who has healthy boundaries).\n\nIf someone disappoints me or breaks a promise, and I end up sad, that's on them, too. But if I set appalling expectations and someone puts up a reasonable boundary and I end up sad, that's 100% on >>ME<<."

    "text": "If sleeping on the couch is an insult, shouldn't the new parent (the husband) be able to sleep on his own bed to not be insulted? You feeling bad for her would just make you vulnerable to their manipulation tbh. Don't let your guard down at the first sight of tears because a person who lived more than 30 years should be able to understand that a couple that just had a baby don't need new drama and entitlement from one of their parents and an adult sobbing like a baby while there's already a baby crying in the other room."

    "text": "> Maybe it's just the part of me that doesnt like to see people in any kind of pain or distress, regardless of whether theyre \"good\" people or not.\n\nThe unfortunate truth here is that these kind of people *depend* on that. They *know* that a lot of people can't handle seeing others 'hurting' or in 'pain', so they lean on that for all it's worth to make a big deal. It's very much like a toddler who has learned that saying \"ow\" gets all sorts of attention. So now they just say \"ow\" for literally everything.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with being a kind person, but to have healthy relationships, you *have* to have healthy boundaries."

    "text": "I think that you're coming from a kind & compassionate place, which is great! It shows that you're capable of giving yourself the compassion that you can give to others. In a forum like this, I think that's really important.\n\nIt sounds like your brain & your heart aren't matching up. You know on a logical level that this situation is not ideal, but your heart says hey, someone is hurt and that's not okay.\n\nI think in a usual setting, there's nothing wrong with that. But what happens if that compassion is given to a con artist?\n\nA normal person would see that compassion & probably feel a bit better. A con artist would see it & think their job is going to be easy.\n\nUnfortunately, your point of view is exactly what the people in question hope for. They may not be aware of it, but there's an instinct that says, \"there's no risk of getting caught here.\"\n\nThey depend on that compassion to blind us to their selfishness. They think, \"oh, well, she'll never say no, so I can just do this.\" That's what my mom does, that's what OP's mom does, and that's what con artists do. They see your compassion & turn it against you.\n\nThat's why this subreddit is filled with so much pain. We grew up trusting these people, believing the con artist when they say family is everything. We grew up idolizing them just to find out they have no problem hurting us to get what they want.\n\nIt feels like the ultimate betrayal when the people that are supposed to love us the most hurt us the most.\n\nOnce I learned the truth, I spent many years thinking the way you are now. I kept thinking I could turn things around if I helped them with this little compassion problem. Lead by example, right?\n\nWell, my parents took that compassion & stabbed me in the back as a response. I could write a book of examples.\n\nEven now, as I sit here with my cat on my lap, I can't help but want to 'fix' my mom. I've spent the last 10 years hoping something would come from the olive branch I extended to her.\n\nInstead, I am listening to her on the phone scheme ways to manipulate my grandmother into getting what she wants at me & my grandmother's expense. I told her not to, and she ignored me.\n\nShe ignored me.\n\nPlease let that sink in. She has ignored me since I was an infant. My neighbors & other family told me that she left me to cry in my crib for hours and hours as an infant, because she was out partying with friends.\n\nWhen my parents got divorced, she never paid child support. When I was 10, she moved 1500 miles (2400km) away. I'm now 30, I DON'T have a child, and she decided she's coming back to be at my home most of the time.\n\nIf I give her compassion, I suffer a deep and terrible pain that has ravaged my mental and physical health, and I neglect the trust between me and my partner. If I say no, I enforce a healthy boundary as this is my SO's home, as well.\n\nShe is creating this drama out of thin air. If she wants to feel love & compassion from me, she has to do it the clean way. No manipulation, no manufactured crises, no stepping on boundaries.\n\nI am willing, but so far, she isn't. That's the issue most of us have. We would love to give kindness rather than harsh, cold stances. Unfortunately, that isn't safe for us. We learn to defend ourselves."

    "text": "Thanks for the thoughtful response, I knew before I posted that people would prolly jump down my throat but I'm just being honest with how I feel. I'm not saying it's right or anything. Just like you said, my brain and heart arent always in sync. And I'm totally aware of that. I'm totally aware that what I just expressed is exactly what a con artist would want from me. I'm aware that it let's them off the hook. I totally get  it. I'm no stranger to these things. I just said that regardless I feel sad about it. Because I just cant wrap my head around someone not having the ability to empathize. And I wonder about the minute chance that you can get through to these severely damaged people. And I wonder if they even understand what's going on in their minds.\n\nLike I said I'm no stranger to this stuff, I grew up with a tyrant of a mother as well who I've been NC with for awhile. I prolly had a very similar story to yours, I could also write a book of times I've been betrayed. Hence the NC. Funny that you say that about leaving you to cry as a baby. Because the exact thing happened to me! I wonder if it's a narc thing. My mom straight up said it before. She was like \"when you wouldnt stop crying I would just leave you in the crib and go downstairs and get away from it\" even as little babies we couldnt get the love we needed. It's so terrible."

    "text": "I hear you, and that's totally fair about people getting on your back about your original comment. I think your comment is valuable and like someone else said, it's as much a part of the conversationas any other one. You even said yourself that you're aware of the disconnect.\n\nI think the alarm bells go off for people because they've experienced someone telling them that they need to be more compassionate. Whoever told them that usually doesn't understand the whole con artist aspect of that relationship. If someone was on fire, and and someone walked up and said, wow, you could really use some gasoline, that person might come to have an overreaction to gasoline in the future. It's not logical, but it's understandable. And I don't really agree with it, but I guess I have compassion for them (lol).\n\nBut, what this really is is a support forum. If someone is having a hard time lining up their brain & heart, that's something to support. In my opinion."

That's not what I was trying to do. But I get how they see it that way. And of course none of us know each others family. So we dont have the feelings and memories attached when we hear the stories. We cant attach a face or emotion to it really so it can be hard to understand peoples experiences. Just cuz u don't know all the little nuances that they know."

OP obviously was there for all of them. This is part of assuming a context of abuse, we give OP the benefit of the doubt that their perspective is valid until proven otherwise. There are very good reasons why OP has no remorse in this situation. I don't enjoy seeing anyone in pain either, but having boundaries and allowing people to experience the consequences of their actions is not an unkindness. Quite the opposite."
