Anytime she gets called out for her abusive behavior from my childhood she starts whining about how abused she was and that \"at least I didn't beat you with a pink wiffle bat.\" Or goes on a tangent about how her mother abused her and that I should be happy she only did what she did.\n\nIt's like No. You had a choice to be better and you didn't. You had the choice to break the abuse cycle and be a loving kind and caring parent but no. You chose to be an abusive turd.\nAnd if she \"apologizes\" for anything it that condenceding gaslight your actually to blame for my behavior apology that isn't an apology."

    "text": "Same ... “you’ll understand when you have kids” is when I just could do really bad things to my nmom without feeing bad at all because that sentence not only normalises her behaviour but also arrogantly and patronisingly tells me that I will be the same piece of shit to my kids. She actually humiliates me with that sentence because she deeply believes that she was right and that I am abusive and sick as well. Just fucking sets me off every time.\nAnd then she has the guts to actually call me up sometimes and casually ask how things are (and eventually start taking about herself) like nothing ever happened. Like NOTHING happened. I mean ... just the amount of pain I am ... we all are in ... and she just acts like it’s all good. And asks me for help with stuff.\nI mean ... HELLO?!?!"

    "text": "That sentence is somehow the most used. Along with the \"when you are my age you will understand\" or \"you are too young now, but you'll understand\". This is a way of invalidating everything you say with an argument that can't ever be changed, cause we will always be younger than them, it's absolutely infuriating 😤\nFor them there is no self-consciousness or guilt. They feel they are always right and they absolutely forget everything very quickly and have really short memory. And because they don't feel emotions the way normal people do, they can insult you all night long and then the next morning they wake up and make you pancakes and ask how is your day with a beautiful smile. It's just how it is. And that same day, they WILL insult you again, and in a few hours after everything will be good again. It's how things go with them. Up and down, all in the same day. There are no good days with them. There are only good moments, as they pass really quickly and they will disrupt peace in a matter of seconds every time something is not the way they want it to be."

    "text": "Expensive gifts is another one. Mine usually didn’t ever have anything to do with what I really loved and cared about. They were just expensive and absolutely useless for me because every time I was like: wtf am I gonna do with this?!? I was never interested in XX and now I must do that because the present cost super much?!?\n\nThis one time she gave a guitar. It was quite a pro thing. Quite expensive. With a cover and some more equipment. I never played the guitar and was never interested. She made me do keyboard some years before that but I hated it and dropped out. So now she gave me a guitar?!? The same day I found this gift I had an important meeting with my sports club that I needed to go out of town for. Long drive and all. I left the guitar where it was, changed after school, my friends picked me up and we went off for what was to become a trip long into the night. Halfway through the meeting my mom calls me up (she knew where I was of course) and furiously threatens to throw the guitar out  the window and since I’m such an ungrateful brat (I was around 15/16) jump herself (as in take her life). The meeting was very important for me. It was not entertainment but a serious gathering of all regional delegates of the sport.\nSo she gave me that somewhat random present and expected me to love her for it and love the “new hobby” she assigned me. I never used the guitar. More of an active winter sports guy. Sold it 15 years later as new - never used. Let my Nmom know."

She was absolutely unaware of your feelings and even tried to mess up with an important day for you and made it about herself and threatened you... My gosh, it's so messed up I can't even. Somehow she believed that she was right about that. Absolute disregard for her child's feelings, wishes, needs. Absolutely zero. Insane."

    "text": "Thanks man!! 🤗 I'm happy to help!\nYeah, unfortunately many nmothers are just like this and they think they can give you gifts and you'll be fine. Just get out of your house, move cities, cause life will always be shitty around them and they will always try to control you and everyone else around. Even when you'll be 50 years old (assuming you are not 50 now ahah), they will still be the same nmom, because they will be forever older than you. The only way to be happy and away from the constant guilt, judgement, anger, drama, is to just move on separate ways and live away from them, only visiting them sometimes. As psychologists say, narcissists don't change. They didn't have normal childhood and didn't develop properly, so they can't ever develop that part of themselves to feel compassion, guilt, shame for what they do to you. They just feel entitled and invalidate everything and everyone. Only they have the truth. And that is not normal. That shouldn't happen. That is abuse. So just let go and move on. New year new life 🥂🎉"

When I tell you how difficult things are you tell me you were in the Holocaust. I know. It wasn't your fault that Hitler attacked your village. I know my mom is mentally ill, but you can't blame me for your bad decisions and your bad luck! You can't let your kids starve while you travel around the world with your new wife and let her show us pictures of your trip!

I really don't know how much was choice and how much of it was so ingrained from her torturous childhood she was hopelessly unaware. I don't indiscriminately accept much of the way she raised me as virtuous or healthy, but I'm grateful my nmom didn't completely surrender to what was foisted upon her at four years old. To some degree that only God knows, she had absolutely no chance to come out of her abuse as a healthy human being.\n\nI believe it takes at least a generation or two to cleanse a legacy of extreme abuse from a family. And if I'm honest, my nmom took a giant first step the best she possibly could. I have to give her due credit.\n\nDon't know how many others out there relate to what I'm saying, but I'd love to hear from all of you."

But to say it takes at least a generation or two to cleanse a legacy of extreme abuse from a family... I’m not *__exactly__* sure what you mean by that, but I have gone through what I would categorize as *__extreme abuse__* and I abuse no one. I was sexually abused at six-years-old, I was verbally and emotionally abused my ENTIRE life, I was physically abused at various points throughout my childhood, the first instance I can *__remember__* being at around six-years-old. I have been institutionally abused by hospitals multiple times.\n\nSo, long story short, I’ve gone through quite a lot of shit. And while I have no children of my own (on purpose because I’m mentally ill), I do have a nephew that I would never even *__think__* of treating abusively. A cycle of abuse stops whenever ONE person stands up and says, ‘No.” That’s it; that’s all it takes. There’s no magical number of cycles, like running a dirty blanket through the wash; got to wash it three times to get that stain out. No. Just... no.\n\nAs they say, ‘This is the End of the Line.’ It ends with you. 🙅‍♀️🛑"
