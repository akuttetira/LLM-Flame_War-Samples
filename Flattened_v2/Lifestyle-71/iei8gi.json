Even my rather shy cousin told her once that she needed to say the magic word when she asked someone to do something for her.\n\nOf course, it made no difference.

Yes it's nice to teach kids to be helpful, as long as my child has grown up to be a good hearted and happy person I know I've done my job right. I can't stand the parents that treat their children like little slaves that must follow orders and remain obedient. Shit, I hate when people treat their dogs like that, never mind children. When folks complain their dog is barking too much all I can think is \"that dog gets to hear you talk all day but the second they try to talk you tell them to be quiet! Imagine if I told people around me to shut up everytime they opened their mouths!!\" smfh.\n\nI went off topic there but bottom line way too many parents (both of the human variety and fur parents) treat their children like subordinates that need to follow orders and protocol. I have my fair share of things I have to unlearn from my childhood, and my first steps were learning to take a deep breath and say please and thank you, I've come a long way from those first steps but life is a series of lessons imo."

Neither myself nor my partner have parents in the picture, I do have my amazing Nana and she helps when she can, but nevertheless I worry. My mom has and had a lot of chronic pains and shit when I was growing up and I had to do everything for her, which is why I don't like asking my daughter for help. But when I do she's eager to help and I try to be as thankful and respectful as I can be, unlike my mom. Most of the time I don't even ask, if my daughter hears me struggling from the next room she comes running asking what I need and when I forget my cane in the kitchen or something she will run off and grab it without me even noticing and bring it over and place it beside me. Bless her heart she makes me proud. But she's 4, and I feel terrible when she tries to take care of me cuz damn, she should be too busy being a kid to take care of her damn parent ya know? I often tell her she doesn't have to help me though I really appreciate it but she just is so insistent."

    "author": "KangarooSnoop",
    "text": "That's interesting, because my parents are weirdly opposite in this kinda way. My mom is constantly giving orders (she's the parent I'm here for btw lol) and she's guilty of all the manipulative ways of explaining why we need to get stuff for her. Most ironically she'll call us lazy when we say we can't or don't want to do something for her. I wish she had the self awareness to realize asking your kid to get you something you totally can get for yourself makes you lazy, not them.\n\nThat said, she always uses manors. Specically pleases and thank yous. She's pretty adamant about it. Like weirdly. For example if we're all giving gifts, and everyone's clearly in a good mood, and appreciative of something she did, but they forgot to say thank you, even though the conversation right after the favor might literally be about how grateful they are, or indicative of that anyway, she still gets offended. And she wants mannors for everything. It's weird and annoying. She basically puts the entire weight of a favor or a kind gesture onto whether or not a thank you proceeds it. Which has ruined a lot of otherwise nice deeds or sweet moments.\n\nHowever, I remember one of my earliest memories of going over to my dads house, and he found it weird how I was perfectly mannered around my sisters and him. He found it kinda formal in that way.  And now I have to say I see why. Obviously I probably used them more bc of how my mom was, but I kinda like the notion of just knowing your around family, and being comfortable just talking to them regularly. You kinda get closer to someone when you strip away something like that and show appreciation and kindness just through hugs and talking. It strangley enough took some of the stress off of family gatherings and made it easier to open up around them. Idk what the science is behind that but it really was nice in that way. Like he just didn't look for the word, he looked to our reactions, or just used common sense and the he knows well enough as his kids to know whether or not we were grateful or not, and we always were. I don't think I've ever been ungrateful towards something he did for me, or unnecessarily rude or blissfully ignorant to a favor.\n\nAnd this was when I really noticed how unnecessarily pedantic my mom was being about manners. Because even though he used them less (and by manners I just mean the golden words.) he was much more kind and accepting than my mom. Like he was just nice and had a kind of etiquette for establishing rules. And nobody was ever really rude or out of line. Except for a few times when my youngest sister was going through highschool lol. But yeah, there was never any pressure put on \"the words.\" Because body language and talking to us was really enough to gage whether we were grateful or not. And it really makes sense. It's just a better form of communicating with people you love imo rather than pretending a word decides whether or not someone is truly happy or uncaring.\n\nI think it's important and nice to say thank you and especially sorry when it's really needed, full disclosure not arguing against manners. But overusing those words for every little thing kinda takes their power away and a lot of the time a friend or family member you're saying them to can probably read \"sorry\" and \"thank you\" before you even say it. They probably know you well enough to the point that saying that stuff is redundant. That's atleast my philosophy of manners, specifically with family.\n\nThat said not using them they're clearly appropriate or when you're talking to strangers or friends or you're at a gathering/dinner/party is kind of a dick move. But in the same circles I have some friends who do and some who don't, and it all comes down to intent, and they still mean well.\n\nAnyways that was a lot. Also sorry if I got reiterative. I went back to try and add more context and now it kinda reads like I start repeating the same point. Not the best writer today\n\nSo in conclusion, maybe your dad just had the same level or thought, or maybe he just didn't care for manners, I don't know, it just made me think about the juxtaposition of my parents in that way. If he's your nparent, I'm sure you're already sick of his shit. So it doesn't matter either way. Hope it gets better with your parent/s, and if it doesn't, hope you've found the space you need and started healing!"

Your father sounds a little bit like my mom. I used to think I wasn't good enough to be able to help her, and that I was failing where a smarter/kinder/more patient person would be, but since discovering this subreddit has made me realize it's a bit of an impossible task. Some people you just can't help/change/heal. It makes me sad a bit, because for as much as I feel she's ruined my childhood and caused our split family, I still love her and I don't want to believe she'll never get better before it's too late. Tbh I'd be fine never seeing her again. I just don't want her to die alone because she refuses to get help or change toxic behavior around family. I feel like I'm gonna lose years off my own life from all this stress and depression from this. The problems having parents like this create seem to never end. I just need to move out once I feel like FL has shaken off enough covid.\n\nI hope you and your husband are doing well! We'll get past this and be stronger than ever."
