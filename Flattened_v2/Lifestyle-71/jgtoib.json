I won't punish anyone with details but pads were not a good option for me even when I was young. For my cousins birthday we went to a Waterpark and I didnt want to miss it because of my period so she finally let me start using them. I was the oldest girl on a trip with all younger girls and my uncle.\n\n\nShe wouldn't buy them until we were waiting for my uncle to pick me up and go to the water park!!! I mean, she sent me clueless to figure out tampons for the first time alone and in public. She was adamant that Im fine on my own and she didn't want to talk about how vaginas work, at all. She didn't even send me with the box and instructions. My poor uncle had to try his best to teach me then when I was crying/embarrassed and decided to sit out all day, a lifeguard had to teach me with all of these grown women laughing and making fun of me in the bathroom.\n\n\nI'm now starting to wonder if this is exactly what my mom wanted to happen, public shame and borderline traumatic embarrassment"

She also claims to have tried them once and she hated them therefore I had to have the same opinion.\n\nI had to sneak tampons into my room and wrap them up in tons of toilet paper to keep her from finding them disposed in the bathroom trash.\n\nI'm sorry you had to go through that trauma. Nparents suck so much ass."

While i was in the bathroom crying trying to get it out my mom accused me of “playing with” myself. She started screaming at me because we had a dinner guest coming and I was supposed to be helping prepare. She was like “ok if it’s really stuck then i’ll take you to the emergency room right now” and just made it even more humiliating. I didn’t want it to be a big deal I just wanted some compassion and guidance. Some people are really just so cold and apathetic it’s baffling."

My mom didn’t believe that I’d started my period, accused me of lying, insisted I bring her my underwear, then, once she was convinced I actually WAS having my period, she told me to just use some of my sister’s tampons and waved me off. Thank god my older sister went to the drug store to get me pads."
