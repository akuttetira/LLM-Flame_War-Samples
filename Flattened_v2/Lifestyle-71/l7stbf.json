It correlates with the number of real survivors on here connecting the dots of their abuse, and realizing they had a pedophile as a parent."

Regardless, it's inappropriate to make the situation about you right now, and it doesn't help to support OP.\n\nThis is the fourth time you've broken our rules, and you insisted on pushing back and being snarky/unkind to other users. You've been permanently banned."
