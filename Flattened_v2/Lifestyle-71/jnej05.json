Emotions are complicated things. Both my parents were/are narcs, and have put me through hell in different ways. But when my mom passed, I still grieved. On one hand, I'm free from her brand of torment, just my father left. On the other, well, she wasnt awful 100% of the time, and I miss the good parts, and the parts that should have been good and now can never be. I'm sorry for what you've been through, but please remember that not everyone's experiences and feelings will be the same, and we should do our best to help posters feel loved and welcomed no matter how they deal with losses. ♡"

If you grieve... if you don't grieve... it's all normal."

    "text": "I have to respectfully disagree. Honestly this whole conversation is triggering, because it feels like you're defending someone who was being disrespectful. I hear what you're saying, but being triggered by something isn't an excuse to behave badly. Nor is it other people's responsibility to manage your emotions. And I've walked on eggshells for far too long to have to do it here where the environment is supposed to be supportive. I get the whole trying to be sensitive with what one says, but there is a point where people just need to take responsibility for how they respond.\n\nThere was no malice in my comment and due to the context in which it was said, the only way to get triggered by it is to completely ignore what was meant. And even then, how they responded to me is not justified.\n\nAlso, I was speaking from my perspective, so don't assume I was speaking for everyone. Nowhere did I imply everyone should feel the same way as me. Simply that I can understand how someone can mourn the loss of a family member who was abusive.\n\nAlso don't assume that everyone has the same definition of family that you do. The conditions on what you choose family to mean is subjective. For me personally, family doesn't need to imply fondness or closeness. I'm not the only one who thinks this way either. The level of love and support (to me) is a separate thing. I'm also not about to apologize for being able to forgive just because some may not be able to. I don't judge people for not forgiving, I get it. I was once there myself. But I'm not about to let people make me feel like it's wrong to forgive and expressing it."

It’s okay to forgive someone for abuse if you want, and the forgiveness is usually for yourself to heal, not to let the abuser back in to abuse you more.\n\nI guess forgiveness in this sense is making peace with the situation and accepting it for what it is."

    "text": "I’m sorry for whatever is happening to you in your life or what potential family members have done to you. You seem to feel strongly about people saying “family is family” and I don’t blame you. I have never been super close with my family aside from my dad cuz he’s the absolute best. I hate when people try to get me to work things out with them because they’re “forever”. I agree that’s coming from a closed-minded viewpoint but our perspective of seeing family as dispensable if they don’t respect our well-being could be seen as closed-minded to *them*.\n\nNeither is necessarily wrong it’s just different - so just like you don’t appreciate being told it’s still family, you’re getting downvoted because you’re pushing your viewpoint onto them when they didn’t ask for your opinion.\n\nI’m sure you’ve been told that phrase a million times so it’s probably extra hurtful to hear it again when none of us know you or what you’ve gone through. I just wanna say that your feelings are valid, even though sharing your opinion was misplaced on this post. 🖤"

    "text": "It's all a matter of how you look at it. I wasn't responding to your personal experiences, as if abuse was ok if it comes from a family member or that your feelings on your experience don't matter. I was responding from the view point that everyone processes things differently and feel differently about their situation. So it's understandable (for me at least) to see someone mourn the loss of a family member, even if that person was abusive, or even be able to love someone even if you can no longer trust them or have them be a part of your life. My Nmom is the only mom I've got, so to me she is still my mom even if it's only biologically.\n\nYou can think different and that's your choice. But don't hate on me for thinking she is still family.\n\nIf someone says sorry for your loss, I assume it comes from a place of sympathy because despite the circumstances, op lost someone, and for all you know they could be mourning that person.\n\nPsychology is complicated. We can't just expect people to feel the same way we do and assume they're wrong if they don't."

Just because you don't believe they're still family doesn't mean someone else feels your same sentiment.\nFamily doesn't abuse family is correct. But we don't abuse here. What you said was unnecessarily mean and unneeded. This is a place for people to share openly and you just slammed the door in the person's face when they tried to express how they were feeling about their nparent.\nI can't lie, I'd be upset when my NMom eventually passes, because I can grieve a relationship I never could have with her.\nIf you are still lashing out at people on the internet you might need to consider helping yourself and removing yourself from this particular thread. There is no bullying allowed here and you have bullied someone."
