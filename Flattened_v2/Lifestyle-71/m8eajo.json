There is more than enough research to indicate that a single event can indeed be traumatic, and repeated trauma is not the only form of trauma.\n\nThis invalidating and diminishing language is also completely unacceptable in a support group for abuse victims, as is the gatekeeping. We also do NOT tolerate transphobia here. You've been given a permanent ban."

If you have genital preferences, literally no one cares, that’s perfectly fine. You’re not obligated to date a single person on this planet, but if you date them because you believe them to be their AGAB you’re transphobic. Fuck off this subreddit, we don’t welcome assholes of your kind here."
