    "text": "I've found narcs don't have children, in the sense they aren't treated as persons or individuals with independent thoughts or feelings. Instead they are treated more as a tool or pet, meant to be useful or not, to obey and not question. To not fit this role or to comply is met with hostility. We're taught our value is what we can offer to them, if you resist then you have less value to them. This is further heightened in adolescence when the child starts to gain a sense of self.\n\nA big part of my own recovery was learning to value myself and to not let it be determined by the opinions of others. Your worth is what you make of it, not someone else.\n\nI really only began to discover this when I cut this toxicity from my life. It's been a struggle but overall I'm much happier. My upbringing is not one I want to repeat and so I've never had any desire for children."

Even though I know I won’t repeat my upbringing (I work with kids every day), I still don’t want to entertain the thought.\n\nI’m partially down that path of valuing my own self, and I’ve more or less cut ties with my mom. I don’t reach i to her at all, but that only serves to heighten my outrage when I think about her putting in no effort to care about me in the slightest. When I left my husband, she didn’t call or ask how I was for 8 months. She def knew.\n\nDo you have siblings? Did you parent treat you and then the same? That’s a huge part of my resentment."

Take my brother to school, look after him while she was at work, give her half my paycheck to help with bills after her 2nd divorce.\n\nHe got into trouble, stole, drugs, huffing paint, spent a lot of time grounded to his room. He went from juvie to prison as the years went.\n\nWere we treated differently, I'm sure we were but for very different reasons."

    "text": "I think that as victims of narcissistic loony toons we will be better parents because we know what NOT to do with our own kids and we have greater empathy as a result. I can’t imagine myself happy if I didn’t have kids. I’ve been like planning their names, their activities, how I’ll raise them, and which boarding schools they’ll attend since age 14. One thing is for sure. They will only get my best and only be around stability. I’ve decided I’m going to marry a stable suitor from a normal family, so this way my future sons know how normal people function and only see love. I’m scared if I bring my future kids around my Mom she might beat them or yell at them like she used to do to me. She doesn’t even respect me.\n\nDon’t cut yourself off from the opportunity to be a parent just because you had a horrible hand in terms of parents. Tyler Perry had horrible parents and an awful childhood and it hasn’t stopped him from giving his whole heart to his son. He’s proof that you can rise up from dysfunction, make a killing as a creative, and be a wonderful husband and father. Hearing Tyler Perry’s story made me feel like I can achieve all of my dreams as well. If he could come up from horrific abuse from people who were supposed to protect him, living in a car, and struggling, and then go on to build a massive production company, net worth in the hundreds of millions, and be the world’s best Dad, then anyone can. Tyler Perry thought he’d be a bad Dad because his own Dad raped him and abused him but he’s done so well. He’s an ideal businessman, father, and husband. A testament to the power of hard work and vision. You can’t control the hand you’re dealt but you can control how you play the hand by giving your children all the love you never got."

I’m making up for that now, even into my thirties.\n\nShe held such control over my life that Im overly independent now and don’t tolerate anyone making decisions for me. I worry about the feeling of having a child depend on me so thoroughly that I would resent it.\nWhat do you think?"

You have infinite worth and were put on Earth for a reason.\n\nI lost my youth too, but let me tell you something. The statute of limitations on childhood trauma ends at age 28. You heard me. Process what you need to process. She’s stolen enough of your life. Don’t let her steal any more of it. Why shut yourself off to happiness and joy just because you had a rough start? You can’t control what happened to you as a child, but you can control what happens to you as an adult. You may be VLC with her but she’s still the negative voice in your head. You won’t feel better until you get rid of your mom AND the negative voice in your head. Both have to die so a new you can emerge"

    "text": "I agree . I’m 29 and a lot of it really kinda... settled and became a bit of the past and now it’s time to move on.\nI’m still learning but the pent up feelings I’ve let go. I can still get bitter simply because none of it has resolved. But that’s not gonna change and I don’t think it’s worth bashing it out. I talk to my dad about it whenever I need to get something off my chest about mom and her impact and how I’ve worked something out. He’s always cared and even given me some tools to recognize and look past my moms mistakes. I think he knows she’s a lost cause stuck in her ways and helped me navigate healing or at the least supporting me.\n\nBut ya. 28 feels like where I left some of it behind. I cried a lot that year. 29 has been great so far tbh. Emotionally no hitches or look backs.\n\nEdit:\n\nHowever not everyone learns how to cope or specifically chooses to IMMEDIATELY make steps to heal from their parents toxic-ass teachings.\n\nI came from a few different backgrounds having been adopted. So I grew up fast in some ways and learned to be somewhat objective. To my emotional detriment.\nBut once I stopped living with them I did make efforts. Here and there, and more in depth after 25."

Hit a 15/10 when I should be aiming for 10...  when what not to do is 2... there’s a whole room for lack of excess. It’s been like 9yrs of fucking yo-yo learning what level of RIGHT is normal and what people SHOULD do.\n\nSo many people went “I never got love” and instead SMOTHER their children. There’s kids who never had a parent that cared to supervise... let me run wild. Now that kid could be a helicopter parent or a strict asshole cuz they had to really learn to be strict to achieve anything. Just some examples of people over correcting themselves when they don’t know what the balance is and where 10/10 is.\n\nEx. My adoptive mom never got music lessons.. she was like, the 8th and last kid... she basically forced music and sports on me. I took up figure skating by my choice but she pushed me to stay in it. I didn’t wanna do voice lessons so she pushed me into piano. I stopped after 3rd year. My hands are small and it was hard to accomplish, plus school was hard and I needed to focus on that.\nI literally never cared about piano.\nShe never got it ao ahe pushed her lost dreams on me forgetting I’m an individual and I may not wanna pick her dreams if my dreams don’t work (like the voice lessons switched to piano)."

His plots are stale and repetitive because he think he can't share his vision. He seems like a narcissist himself. He is successful though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think that since you phrased it the way you did, you wont be shitty like that though"

    "text": "You know, I think he does that because there are a lot of matriarchal issues in single black households--men in jail, women trying to be both husband and wife--and it's what sells to a largely uneducated, discriminated against target market. The people the films are intended for enjoy them and that's what matters; he's not making the films for educated elites like us. He's making them for people in the projects who may have a Dad in jail and a stepdad up to no good. He's a very very sharp businessman because he turned all of his own pain into works of art that are appreciating in value over time. Every cent he receives is addressing his own issues. I really truly respect what he's built. He came from nothing, had every disadvantage and is now worth over $600 Million with his whipsmart, genuinely kind son on the Honors Roll. That's like my dream life, even if I don't particularly enjoy his style of films as a non-African American. His target market is not really my target market but it doesn't diminish what he has achieved in every category of life. Tyler Perry is proof positive that it doesn't matter how abusive your childhood was. If you work hard, then you can get a better life and give your kids a better life.\n\nI'll be a fantastic, world class, absolutely extraordinary wife and mother. It's the highest calling in life. Of course, I love my business like it's my firstborn son and I also love money very very much, but I can guarantee I'll love my actual sons more than my business when I become a mother and dominate all the other mothers in the PTA. My future sons will all be top academic achievers and good people with strong work ethics, just like their Mom.\n\nPS Tyler Perry's Mom didn't protect him from repeated molestation."
