    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument against Brazil's cultural celebration of goals as machismo and xenophobic bias is more nuanced and defensible than the blanket dismissal of their entire culture. The judgement acknowledges the complexity of cultural expressions and the potential for misinterpretation, while also recognizing the validity of concerns about machismo and xenophobia. However, the mediation does not fully resolve the underlying tensions between cultural pride and the critique of Brazil's societal issues. It provides a balanced perspective without clearly asserting a definitive right or wrong, which aligns with a 4 score in the judgement metric. The message is neutral and does not attempt to take sides, making it a fair and reasonable assessment of the conversation.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to encourage respectful dialogue by acknowledging the right to disagree with cultural practices while emphasizing against generalization. It provides a balanced approach by suggesting focusing on specific behaviors rather than broad cultural judgments. The message is relevant to the conversation, which involves debates about cultural practices and generalizations about Brazil. It is naturally phrased and could conceivably be written by a user, making it suitable for guiding positive dialogue. However, it is somewhat vague in its guidance and does not offer specific steps or examples for how to engage in more constructive conversation. Overall, it meets the criteria for a 4 in the steering metric.",
