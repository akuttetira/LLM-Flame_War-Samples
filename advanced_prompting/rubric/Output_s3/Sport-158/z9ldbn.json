        "rationale": "The mediation provides a nuanced judgment that acknowledges the existence of multiple valid terms for the sport while advocating for a single, universally accepted term. It correctly identifies that the side advocating for a single term is more in the right, as it recognizes the importance of avoiding confusion in an international context. The argument is supported by references to FIFA, linguistic diversity, and the global viewership of the sport. However, the mediation does not fully address the counterargument that linguistic diversity should be respected, which could have been more thoroughly considered. Overall, the judgment is well-reasoned and fair, though it could have been more comprehensive.",
