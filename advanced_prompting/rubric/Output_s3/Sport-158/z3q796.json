        "rationale": "The mediation provides a judgment that one side (those calling out normalmisha) is more correct than the other (those who are late and don't care about context). It addresses the content of the conversation, identifying the insensitive and racist comment as the main issue. However, the mediation lacks specific evidence or context to support the claim that the comments are racist or insensitive, which is a critical flaw. While the judgment is somewhat reasonable, it does not fully back up its position with concrete examples or reasoning, which weakens its credibility. The mediation is neutral in tone but lacks the depth needed for a 5. It correctly identifies the more problematic behavior but does not fully justify the conclusion with sufficient support.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to steer the conversation back to the main issue. It acknowledges the potential hurtfulness of normalmisha's comment and encourages a focus on addressing it rather than getting sidetracked. However, the message is somewhat vague in its assessment of the comment being 'hurtful and racist' without providing specific evidence or context. While it is relevant and natural in the context of the conversation, it lacks the specificity needed to fully guide positive dialogue. The message is not overly parental or computer-generated, but it could have been more direct in its guidance.",
