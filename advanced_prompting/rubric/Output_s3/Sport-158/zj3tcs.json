        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that Khunzar-ri's defense of their country and right to enjoy rivalries is more justified, while Legoleamela's comments are inflammatory and racist. The judgement is based on common morality and fairness principles, and it clearly specifies that one side is in the right. The argument against Legoleamela's comments is strong and aligns with principles of respect and fairness. However, the mediation could have provided more context about the historical and cultural significance of the rivalry to fully back up its position. Despite this, the overall judgement is accurate and fair.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It directly addresses the issue of personal attacks and encourages respectful disagreement about team loyalties. The message is relevant to the conversation, which involves heated exchanges and personal insults, and it provides a clear path for more positive dialogue. The tone is natural and would conceivably be written by a user aiming to de-escalate the conflict.",
