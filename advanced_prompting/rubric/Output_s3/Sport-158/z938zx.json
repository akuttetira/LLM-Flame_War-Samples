        "rationale": "The mediation provides a clear judgment that personal attacks and insults are unreasonable, and that achievements should be evaluated based on skill rather than physical attributes or nationality. It correctly identifies the more reasonable stance and backs it up with a principled argument about fairness and respect. The judgment is neutral in tone and does not take sides in a way that favors one participant over another, which aligns with the principles of fairness and morality. The message is also concise and directly addresses the issue at hand, making it effective as a judgment.",
