        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced view, acknowledging that Martinez's behavior was classless but also recognizing that the criticism was harsh and dismissive. It does not definitively label one side as entirely correct but instead offers a nuanced perspective. The judgement is fair and considers both sides of the argument, though it does not clearly specify a correct side or a neutral position as explicitly as it could. The reasoning is reasonable and grounded in the context of the conversation.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to de-escalate the conversation by acknowledging differing comfort levels with celebration. It suggests a compromise by agreeing that some reactions are more annoying than others and advises to let it go. However, the message is somewhat vague and not directly relevant to the specific issue at hand, which is the inappropriate and offensive comments made by some users. The message lacks specificity and does not address the underlying issues of toxicity and disrespect in the conversation. While it is natural in tone, it does not provide a clear path forward or encourage constructive dialogue. It is not overly parental or computer-generated, but it falls short of being extremely productive or directly relevant.",
