        "rationale": "The mediation provides a nuanced judgment that acknowledges the validity of concerns about England's past performance while rejecting the extreme claim that they will 'never' win the World Cup again. It correctly identifies the more reasonable argument and offers a balanced perspective. The judgment is fair, grounded in common morality and fairness principles, and clearly specifies a correct position without being overly rigid. The reasoning is sound and supports the conclusion effectively.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It shifts the focus to a positive and relevant topic (the England women\u2019s team) while maintaining a supportive tone. The message is directly relevant to the conversation, as it addresses the potential for a positive outcome and encourages a more constructive dialogue. It is natural in context and could conceivably be written by a user aiming to keep the conversation respectful and forward-looking. The message avoids taking sides and promotes inclusivity, which aligns with the goal of steering the conversation in a positive direction.",
