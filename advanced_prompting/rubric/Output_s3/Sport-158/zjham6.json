    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a judgment that acknowledges the seriousness of Qatar's exploitation of migrant workers while also addressing the counterargument about Western exploitation. It correctly identifies that focusing on the specific issue of Qatar's labor practices is more defensible than dismissing the entire World Cup due to broader global issues. The judgment is neutral and does not take a side but rather evaluates the strength of each argument. However, it could have been more explicit in its reasoning and could have provided more concrete examples to support its position. The judgment is well-reasoned and aligns with common morality and fairness principles.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to steer the conversation back to the specific issue of worker exploitation in Qatar. It acknowledges the complexity of the issue and encourages a more productive dialogue by focusing on the specific context. However, the message is somewhat vague and does not directly address the underlying tensions or provide clear guidance on how to move forward. While it is relevant to the conversation, it lacks the specificity and directness needed to effectively guide positive dialogue. The message is natural in context but could be more precise in its guidance.",
