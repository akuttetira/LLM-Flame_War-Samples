        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the person defending Aguero and criticizing shunt_resistor\u2019s insults as 'trashy' and 'vile' is more in the right than the one who claims Aguero is irrelevant and insults Barca fans. The mediation acknowledges the context of the discussion, the nature of the insults, and the historical achievements of Aguero. It recognizes that while Aguero may have had a controversial personality, the criticism of his character is more extreme and less justifiable than the defense of his actions. The mediation does not take a definitive stance on Aguero's overall value but rather focuses on the nature of the insults and the context of the discussion. The argument is well-supported by the context of the conversation and the content of the comments.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to steer the conversation back to a more rational and respectful discussion. It acknowledges the issue of trolling and personal attacks while encouraging focus on the topic at hand. The message is natural in context and directly relevant to the conversation, making it likely that it would guide positive dialogue. However, it is somewhat vague in its approach and does not offer specific guidance on how to proceed. It is not overly parental or computer-generated, but it lacks the specificity needed for a 5. It is a reasonable attempt to de-escalate the situation and promote constructive dialogue.",
