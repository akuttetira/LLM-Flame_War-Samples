        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced view, acknowledging that Ange\u2019s Europa League win has some merit despite his poor league performance. It recognizes the complexity of the debate and doesn't outright dismiss the argument that the Europa League win is a redeeming factor. However, it doesn't clearly assert which side is entirely correct, which is a limitation for a judgement. The message is neutral and reasonable, but it doesn't fully resolve the conflict in favor of one side with strong backing arguments. It scores well on fairness and neutrality but could have been more definitive in its judgment.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and attempts to balance the discussion by acknowledging Ange's achievement of winning a trophy in his first season. It encourages a more nuanced perspective by suggesting that achievements should not be judged solely on a single season's league performance. The message is relevant to the conversation and aims to guide the discussion towards a more balanced view. However, it is somewhat vague in its approach and does not directly address the specific arguments being made about the team's performance. The tone is natural and could conceivably be written by a user, but it lacks the specificity needed to fully steer the conversation towards a more constructive direction.",
