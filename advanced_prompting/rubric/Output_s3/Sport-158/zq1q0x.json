    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that ucccft's defense of Argentina and Messi is more justified than Weak-Pudding-322's dismissive and xenophobic comments. The judgement acknowledges the global admiration for Argentina and Messi, and correctly critiques the biased and derogatory remarks about Argentinians. The reasoning is based on common morality and fairness principles, and clearly specifies a correct side. The support for the judgement is solid, as it references the widespread international support for Argentina and Messi, and the fallacy of generalizing about a whole country based on hearsay. The judgement is clear and well-reasoned.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the excitement of the moment while promoting a neutral and inclusive perspective. The message is relevant to the conversation, as it addresses the underlying theme of fan loyalty and the role of players like Messi. It is natural in context and could conceivably be written by a user, as it avoids taking sides and encourages shared appreciation for the sport. The message effectively steers the conversation towards a more positive and unified direction without imposing any particular viewpoint.",
