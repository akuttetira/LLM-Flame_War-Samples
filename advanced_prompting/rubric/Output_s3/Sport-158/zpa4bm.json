        "rationale": "The mediation provides a nuanced judgment that acknowledges the complexity of the debate. It recognizes the argument that FIFA World Cup titles may be influenced by oil money as more defensible, while also addressing the concerns about the tournament's financial and social implications. However, it does not clearly specify which side is entirely correct, nor does it provide strong, concrete evidence to back up its position. The judgment is fair and balanced, but lacks the decisiveness and supporting arguments needed for a higher score. The steering aspect is not applicable here since this is a judgment, not a steering message.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to guide the conversation towards a more respectful and factual discussion. It encourages participants to focus on specific concerns rather than personal attacks or inflammatory language, which is appropriate given the context of the conversation. The message is relevant, natural, and has a high chance of guiding positive dialogue. It does not take a side but instead promotes a constructive approach to the discussion. The message is well-worded and would seem authentic to a user in the context of the conversation.",
