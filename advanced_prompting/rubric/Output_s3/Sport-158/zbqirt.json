    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced judgment that acknowledges Messi's overall greatness while recognizing his struggles in the Champions League. It correctly identifies that focusing on Messi's team performance in the Champions League is less defensible than arguing for his status as the GOAT. The judgment is fair, neutral, and supports the position that Messi's overall career achievements outweigh his individual tournament failures. The reasoning is sound and aligns with common morality and fairness principles.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to steer the conversation back to a positive focus on Messi\u2019s achievements. It avoids the contentious debate about Mbapp\u00e9 versus Messi and encourages the participants to share personal favorites, which can foster a more constructive and positive dialogue. The message is relevant to the conversation, natural in context, and has a high chance of guiding positive dialogue. However, it is somewhat vague in its specific guidance and does not directly address the previous points of contention. It is not overly parental or computer-generated, but it could have been more specific in its steering.",
