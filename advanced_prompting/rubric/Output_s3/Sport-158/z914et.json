    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a judgment that the individuals criticizing AlludedNuance for trolling and deflecting are more in the right. This is based on the context of the conversation, where AlludedNuance is accused of trolling by pointing out the sheet was not clean before the match. The mediation acknowledges the argument that the other person is making a claim without context, which is a fair assessment. However, the judgment is somewhat vague and does not provide strong, concrete arguments to back up the claim that the critics are more right. It also does not clearly specify which side is entirely correct or neutral, making the judgment less definitive. The mediation is somewhat neutral but lacks the strength to fully justify a 5. It is somewhat fair but not completely conclusive.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to guide the conversation towards a more respectful and constructive direction. It acknowledges the potential for troll behavior and encourages moving on from a single post, which is relevant to the context of the conversation. The message is natural in tone and could conceivably be written by a user, making it effective in steering the discussion towards civility. However, it is somewhat vague in its approach and does not provide specific guidance on how to handle the situation, which could limit its effectiveness. Overall, it scores well in terms of being neutral and encouraging positive dialogue, but could be more specific.",
