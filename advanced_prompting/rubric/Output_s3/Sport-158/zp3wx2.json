        "rationale": "The mediation provides a nuanced judgment that acknowledges the complexity of the situation. It recognizes that while the penalty call on Di Maria may be debatable, the argument about referee bias against France is more defensible. The mediation does not take a definitive stance on whether the penalty was an obvious dive or not, which is appropriate given the conflicting viewpoints. However, it does not fully resolve the dispute or provide a clear conclusion, which could be seen as lacking in decisiveness. The judgment is fair and balanced, but it does not fully address the core issue of whether the referee was biased, which is a key point in the argument. Overall, the judgment is reasonable but not entirely conclusive.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and attempts to steer the conversation towards a more balanced discussion. It acknowledges the passion of the participants and suggests that the outcome was a combination of factors, which is a neutral and respectful approach. However, it is somewhat vague and does not directly address the specific points of contention between the users, such as the penalty call and the referee's decisions. While it is natural in context, it could have been more specific to guide the conversation effectively.",
