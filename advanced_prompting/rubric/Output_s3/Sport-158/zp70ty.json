    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a judgment that identifies the defender of the original comment as more in the right, arguing that the troll's reaction is inappropriate. The reasoning is based on the idea that the troll is being dismissive and not engaging with the commentator's opinion. However, the mediation is somewhat vague in its justification and does not provide clear, concrete evidence or moral principles to support the conclusion. It also does not fully address the nuances of the conversation, such as the context of the troll's comment and the potential for misunderstanding. While the judgment is somewhat reasonable, it lacks the depth and clarity needed for a 5. The mediation is more of a 4, as it correctly identifies the more defensible position but does not fully back it up with strong arguments.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the original post's value and redirects the conversation back to the main topic of Peter Drury's commentary. The message is relevant to the conversation and has a high chance of guiding positive dialogue. It is natural in context and could conceivably be written by a user. The message encourages a constructive discussion without taking sides or imposing a judgment, which aligns well with the steering role. However, it could be slightly more specific in asking for opinions on what makes the commentary memorable, but overall, it scores highly in terms of neutrality and guidance.",
