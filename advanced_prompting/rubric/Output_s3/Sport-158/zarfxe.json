        "rationale": "The mediation provides a nuanced judgment that acknowledges Uruguay's historical significance while also addressing concerns about their current standing. It correctly identifies that the argument against Uruguay being a 'big team' today is more defensible than the claim that they are a 'big team' solely based on past achievements. The judgment is balanced, recognizing both the historical context and current performance. However, it does not fully resolve the debate between historical prestige and current relevance, which could be more clearly articulated. The judgment is fair and principled, but could be more definitive in its conclusion.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message acknowledges the disagreement over the definition of a 'big team' and offers a balanced perspective by recognizing Uruguay's historical significance while noting their current performance as mediocre. It encourages focusing on actual performance rather than past achievements, which is fair and neutral. The message is conciliatory, relevant to the conversation, and natural in context, making it likely to guide positive dialogue. It does not take a side but instead facilitates a more constructive discussion.",
