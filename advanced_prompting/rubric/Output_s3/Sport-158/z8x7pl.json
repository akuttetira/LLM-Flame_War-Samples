    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to evaluate the argument about human rights and Islamophobia in the conversation. It suggests that the claim that human rights are not universally applicable is more problematic than the claim that Islam is singled out. However, this judgement is vague and does not clearly establish which side is correct based on morality or fairness. The mediation does not provide specific reasoning or evidence to support its conclusion, making it difficult to assess the validity of the argument. While it attempts to address the issue, it lacks the clarity and support needed for a strong judgement.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The generated mediation message is conciliatory and aims to steer the conversation towards a more constructive direction by focusing on the specific incident and the definition of hate speech. It avoids taking sides and encourages a discussion on how to address the issue without personal attacks. The message is relevant to the conversation, natural in context, and has a high chance of guiding positive dialogue. However, it is somewhat vague in its approach and does not provide specific guidance on how to proceed. It is not overly parental or computer-generated, but it could have been more direct in its steering. Overall, it scores well on the steering metrics but could be slightly improved.",
