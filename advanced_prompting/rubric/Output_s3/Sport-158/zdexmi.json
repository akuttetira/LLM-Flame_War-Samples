    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced view of the discussion, acknowledging the complexity of the topic and the validity of different perspectives. It avoids taking a clear side and instead emphasizes the nuance of the debate. However, it does not offer a clear judgment on which side is correct, which is necessary for a full assessment. The message is neutral and avoids taking a stance that could be seen as biased, making it fair and appropriate for the context of the conversation.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The steering message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the passion in the conversation and suggests a more factual and respectful approach. The message is directly relevant to the conversation, as it addresses the issue of personal attacks and generalizations. It is natural in context and could conceivably be written by a user aiming to facilitate a more constructive dialogue.",
