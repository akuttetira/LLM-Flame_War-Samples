        "rationale": "The mediation provides a nuanced judgment that acknowledges the validity of questioning the Hand of God goal's feasibility in modern football and the likelihood of a repeat match. It also correctly identifies that blanket claims about team deservingness or player greatness are less justified. The judgment is balanced, acknowledges differing viewpoints, and does not take an absolute stance on either side. However, it could have provided more specific reasoning for why the Hand of God goal is considered less likely in modern times, which would have strengthened the argument. Overall, the judgment is fair and well-reasoned, though not entirely conclusive.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to steer the conversation back to the actual match and goal. It avoids personal opinions and hypotheticals, which aligns with the goal of fostering positive dialogue. The message is relevant to the conversation and naturally fits the context, as it redirects the discussion to the core issue. However, it is somewhat vague in its guidance and does not explicitly encourage the participants to focus on the match details. It could be more direct in prompting them to discuss the match itself rather than the hypotheticals or personal opinions. Overall, it is a productive and natural message that encourages a more focused discussion.",
