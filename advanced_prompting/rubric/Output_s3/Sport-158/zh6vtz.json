    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a judgment that Messi's 'no look' assist is more in the right than the criticism that dismisses it as 'magical' or implies Messi is less skilled for not looking down at the ball. However, the judgment is not fully supported by the conversation. The original conversation includes strong criticism of Messi's play, with some users arguing that not looking before a pass is basic soccer skill, not 'magical.' The mediation's conclusion is somewhat neutral but does not fully address the underlying debate about the nature of soccer skills and the perception of 'magic' in football. The judgment is not strongly backed by the content of the conversation, which is more about cultural and linguistic misunderstandings than a clear moral or fairness issue.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to steer the conversation towards a more positive and unified direction. It acknowledges the excitement around Messi and 'no look' passes without taking sides in the debate about soccer terminology or playing style. The message is natural in context, encourages agreement on a shared value (Messi's legend status), and avoids the contentious topics that have been escalating in the conversation. However, it is somewhat vague in its guidance and does not directly address the specific points of contention. It is effective in diffusing tension but lacks the specificity needed to guide the conversation more effectively.",
