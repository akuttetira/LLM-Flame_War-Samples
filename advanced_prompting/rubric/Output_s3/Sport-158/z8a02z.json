    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a nuanced judgment that acknowledges the historical relevance of the US victory in the War of Independence while criticizing the inflammatory and personal attacks in the conversation. It correctly identifies that the historical argument is more defensible than the derogatory language, which aligns with fairness and neutrality. However, it does not explicitly state which side is entirely correct, which is acceptable for a neutral judgment. The message is clear and reasonable, though it could have been more specific about the historical context. Overall, it scores well in terms of fairness and neutrality.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to steer the conversation towards a more respectful and historically focused discussion. It acknowledges the potential for divisiveness and encourages a constructive dialogue by asking for specific aspects of the War of Independence. The message is relevant to the conversation and natural in context, as it addresses the inflammatory tone of the original exchange without taking sides. It avoids being overly parental or generated, and instead offers a productive path forward. However, it could be slightly more direct in encouraging users to engage with the historical context rather than continuing the hostile exchange.",
