    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a judgment that acknowledges the potential for growth and learning between Japan and South Korea, while dismissing the idea of a pseudo race war as more inflammatory. This reflects a neutral position that prioritizes constructive dialogue over divisive narratives. The reasoning is reasonable and aligns with common principles of fairness and mutual respect. However, the mediation does not fully engage with the nuances of the debate, such as the historical context of tensions between the two countries or the role of media in shaping perceptions. It also does not clearly specify a correct side but rather offers a balanced perspective. Overall, the judgment is well-reasoned and fair, though it could have been more detailed in its analysis.",
