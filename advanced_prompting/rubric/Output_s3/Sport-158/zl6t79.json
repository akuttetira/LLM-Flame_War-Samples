        "rationale": "The mediation provides a judgment that Argentina displayed class and respect in their interactions with Croatia, which aligns with the majority of the conversation where users praised Argentina's behavior. The argument is supported by the specific mention of Argentina's actions in the 2018 match and their behavior in the current tournament. The mediation correctly identifies the side that is more in the right based on the context and the comments made by multiple users. The judgment is clear and backed by the conversation's content, making it a fair and reasonable assessment.",
