        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument against Brazilian players' celebratory behavior is more defensible than the blanket accusation of xenophobia and racism against all Brazilians. The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the issue, recognizing that while some Brazilians may engage in disrespectful behavior, it is not representative of all. It also addresses the broader context of prejudice and stereotyping, which is a nuanced and fair approach. The judgement is well-reasoned and aligns with common morality and fairness principles by avoiding generalizations and promoting understanding. However, it does not explicitly state that one side is entirely correct, which could be seen as a neutral position, but the reasoning supports the defensibility of the argument against the blanket accusations.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to de-escalate the tension by focusing on specific behaviors rather than generalizations. It is relevant to the conversation, as the discussion involves accusations of disrespect and generalization about Brazilian and German fans. The message is natural in context and encourages a more constructive dialogue by shifting the focus to individual actions rather than group stereotypes. However, it is somewhat vague in its guidance and does not provide specific steps to resolve the tension. It avoids taking sides but encourages a more respectful conversation, which aligns with the goal of mediation.",
