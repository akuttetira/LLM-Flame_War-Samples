        "rationale": "The mediation offers a judgement that attempts to evaluate the relative correctness of two opposing viewpoints. The mediator concludes that the person pointing out the lack of Asian representation in Gon\u00e7alo Ramos\u2019s face is more correct than the person making a flippant comment. This judgement is based on the idea that the former is addressing a potential issue of representation, while the latter is making a dismissive or irrelevant comment. The mediator provides a nuanced take by acknowledging the validity of one perspective while dismissing the other as flippant. However, the judgement is somewhat vague in its reasoning and does not provide clear, concrete evidence or arguments to support its conclusion. The mediator does not fully explain why one perspective is more correct than the other, and the reasoning is not strongly backed by common morality or fairness principles. While the judgement is somewhat reasonable, it lacks the strength and clarity needed for a 5. It deserves a 4 because it correctly identifies one side as more in the right and provides some support for that position, though the support is not as strong or clear as it could be.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and effectively guides the conversation back to the topic of Gon\u00e7alo Ramos's achievements. It acknowledges the previous comments about his appearance but redirects the focus to the relevant subject. The message is natural in context, respectful, and clearly aims to maintain productive dialogue. It does not impose a judgment but rather encourages staying on topic, which is a fair and effective approach for a mediator.",
