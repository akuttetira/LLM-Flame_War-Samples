        "rationale": "The mediation correctly acknowledges the complexity of the cultural context surrounding South American football fans and Mbapp\u00e9's response. It avoids a simplistic judgment about Mbapp\u00e9's maturity and instead recognizes the nuanced nature of the debate. The argument that South American fans have a different cultural approach to celebrating and mocking players is supported by multiple comments in the conversation, including from users like M4G095 and Ok_Search_8793. However, the mediation does not fully resolve the debate about whether Mbapp\u00e9's comments were immature or not, and it does not clearly specify which side is entirely correct. It strikes a balance between the two perspectives but lacks a definitive conclusion. This makes it a 4 in the judgement metric, as it correctly identifies the more nuanced argument but does not fully back it up with definitive reasoning.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the complexity of the situation by suggesting that Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s comments may have been out of line, but also emphasizes the importance of not generalizing entire cultures based on one person\u2019s words. The message encourages focusing on Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s acknowledgment of his mistake and his maturity, which helps to steer the conversation towards a more constructive and respectful direction. The message is natural in context and could conceivably be written by a user, making it effective in guiding positive dialogue.",
