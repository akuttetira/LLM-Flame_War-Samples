    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a nuanced judgment that acknowledges the\u5408\u7406\u6027 of protecting Cristian Romero and his son from unwanted attention while rejecting the call for physical harm or humiliation. It correctly identifies the more reasonable stance and avoids endorsing the more extreme views expressed in the conversation. The judgment is based on common morality and fairness principles, and it clearly specifies a correct side without being overly prescriptive. However, the mediation could have been more specific about why protecting Romero is more reasonable, such as referencing the potential harm to minors or the violation of personal boundaries. Overall, the judgment is well-reasoned and fair.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to steer the conversation towards a more neutral and constructive direction. It acknowledges the potentially offensive nature of the comments while encouraging a focus on the event itself rather than the individual. The message is relevant to the conversation and has a high chance of guiding positive dialogue. It is naturally phrased and could conceivably be written by a user seeking to de-escalate the situation. However, it is somewhat vague in its approach and does not explicitly address the underlying issues or provide clear guidance on how to proceed. Overall, it is a reasonable attempt at steering the conversation in a more neutral and productive direction.",
