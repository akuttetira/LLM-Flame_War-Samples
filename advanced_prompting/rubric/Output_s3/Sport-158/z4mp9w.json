    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a nuanced judgment that acknowledges both perspectives. It recognizes that while some view the action as a minor annoyance, others see it as disrespectful. The judgment leans towards the side that sees it as a minor annoyance, which is a reasonable middle ground given the context of the World Cup and the cultural context of American sports culture. The supporting argument is reasonable but not definitive, as it does not fully address the underlying issue of respect and courtesy in sports. The judgment is fair and balanced, though it does not fully resolve the disagreement.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to guide the conversation towards a more respectful and civil tone. It acknowledges the potential for disagreement while encouraging participants to avoid insults and assumptions about national values. The message is relevant to the context of the discussion and is naturally phrased, making it likely that a user would find it trustworthy. However, it is somewhat vague in its specific guidance and does not offer concrete steps for improving the dialogue. It successfully steers the conversation away from negativity but lacks the specificity needed for a 5. Overall, it meets the criteria for a 4 in the steering metric.",
