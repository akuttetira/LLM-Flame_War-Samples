    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation offers a nuanced judgment that acknowledges the complexity of the issue, recognizing that the prohibition of music and dance in some Islamic traditions is not universally applicable and can vary based on interpretation and context. It correctly identifies that the person questioning the haramness of celebration is more in the right, as the argument considers the nuances of Islamic tradition and personal expression. The judgment is supported by the context of the conversation, where there is a discussion about differing interpretations and the role of religious texts. However, the mediation does not provide a comprehensive or universally accepted explanation for the variation in Islamic practices, which could be seen as a slight weakness. Overall, the judgment is fair and balanced, acknowledging the complexity of the issue without taking a definitive stance on what is universally correct.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to foster understanding between different perspectives. It acknowledges the user's effort to engage with a different faith background and encourages mutual learning. However, it is somewhat vague and does not directly address the specific points of contention in the conversation. The message is natural in context but lacks specificity in guiding the conversation towards a more productive direction. It does not provide clear steps or suggestions for moving forward, which could have made it more effective. Overall, it is a reasonable attempt at steering the conversation but could be more direct and actionable.",
