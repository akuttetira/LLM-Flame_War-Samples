        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument that Morocco's win is not an upset because they were the favorites is more defensible than the blanket claims of racism and personal attacks. The mediation acknowledges the technical definition of an 'upset' in sports and correctly points out that the discussion has become dominated by personal attacks and accusations of racism, which are not relevant to the actual definition of an upset. The message is neutral, acknowledges the complexity of the issue, and steers the conversation back to the factual definition of an upset without taking sides. It is a balanced and fair assessment of the situation.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the main topic of the thread (the World Cup win being an upset) and encourages respectful dialogue. The message is directly relevant to the conversation and has a high chance of guiding positive dialogue. It is natural in context and could conceivably be written by a user. The message effectively steers the conversation back to the main topic while promoting civility.",
