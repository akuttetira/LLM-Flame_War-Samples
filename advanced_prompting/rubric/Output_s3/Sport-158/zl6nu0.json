    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a nuanced judgment that acknowledges the complexity of the debate around supporting different teams in a sports context. It recognizes that while some may criticize others for rooting for a team they are not affiliated with, it is also valid to support a team that one is not necessarily connected to. The judgment is not absolute but rather acknowledges the differing perspectives. However, it does not fully address the underlying issue of whether rooting for a team is inherently 'hateful' or not, and it leans slightly towards the side of Unfair_Conference_73 by suggesting that their stance is more justified. The judgment is fair and balanced, though it could have been more neutral in its conclusion.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive, aiming to de-escalate the tension between the participants. It acknowledges the diversity of opinions and encourages a focus on enjoyment rather than conflict. The message is relevant to the conversation, natural in context, and could conceivably be written by a user. It avoids taking sides and promotes mutual respect, which aligns with the goal of steering the conversation positively. However, it is somewhat vague in its specific guidance and does not offer concrete steps to move the discussion forward. Overall, it scores well on both fairness and neutrality, but could be more specific in its steering.",
