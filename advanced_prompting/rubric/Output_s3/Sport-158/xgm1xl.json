    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance the arguments presented by both sides. It acknowledges that ViniJnr's comparison to a monkey could be seen as a playful insult rather than a racist act, which is a reasonable interpretation given the context. However, it also recognizes that the reaction from fans, including calling Vini a monkey and bringing toy monkeys to the stadium, suggests that the comparison was perceived as racist. The mediation does not definitively declare one side correct but instead presents a nuanced view that acknowledges the complexity of the issue. While the judgement is not fully conclusive, it provides a balanced perspective that reflects the arguments on both sides. The score is slightly lower than a 5 because the mediation does not fully resolve the issue but rather presents a middle ground.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to de-escalate the conversation by encouraging participants to focus on the language used rather than making assumptions about intentions. It acknowledges the emotional intensity of the discussion and suggests a more constructive approach. The message is relevant to the conversation, natural in context, and has a high chance of guiding positive dialogue. However, it is somewhat vague in its specific guidance and does not directly address the core issues of racism and cultural sensitivity that are central to the discussion. It avoids taking a clear stance but provides a neutral, supportive framework for the conversation to continue constructively.",
