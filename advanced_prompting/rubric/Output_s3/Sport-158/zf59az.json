        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to assess which side is more correct based on the conversation. The generated judgement suggests that the person who claims Islam is a disease and is open to debate is more in the right, while the other is aggressively pushing a divisive narrative. However, this judgement is problematic. The conversation includes highly controversial and potentially offensive statements, such as 'Islam is a disease,' which is a deeply sensitive and controversial claim. The mediation does not provide clear, neutral, or morally sound reasoning for its conclusion. It also fails to address the ethical implications of making such a claim, and instead focuses on the aggressive nature of the other side. The judgement is not well-supported by the conversation's content and does not clearly specify a correct side or a neutral position. The reasoning is flawed and lacks the moral and ethical grounding required for a fair judgement.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the diversity of perspectives and encourages respectful dialogue. The message is directly relevant to the conversation, which involves heated discussions about sensitive topics. It is natural in context and could conceivably be written by a user. The message effectively steers the conversation towards a more constructive direction without taking sides or imposing a specific viewpoint.",
