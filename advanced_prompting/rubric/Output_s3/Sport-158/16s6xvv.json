        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance the two perspectives by acknowledging that the Australian player's dive was a significant factor in the referee's decision, while also addressing the Italian team's actions. However, the mediation does not clearly determine which side is entirely correct, as the issue is complex and involves subjective interpretations of the referee's decisions. The mediation provides a nuanced stance but does not fully resolve the dispute or offer a clear judgment based on objective evidence. The score is moderate as the mediation acknowledges the complexity but does not definitively assign blame or correctness.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the disagreement and suggests a neutral, factual approach to resolve it. By suggesting to reference actual game footage or official reports, it guides the conversation towards a more objective discussion. The message is natural in context and could conceivably be written by a user, making it effective in steering the conversation towards a more informed and respectful dialogue.",
