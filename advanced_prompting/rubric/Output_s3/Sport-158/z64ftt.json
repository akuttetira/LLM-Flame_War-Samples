        "rationale": "The mediation output provides a balanced perspective on the discussion about cultural norms and public displays of affection in Qatar. It acknowledges the complexity of the issue without taking a clear stance on whether the actions are illegal or frowned upon. The message is neutral and does not attempt to judge the correctness of the opposing views, which aligns with the principle of fairness. However, it does not offer a clear resolution or direction for the conversation, which could be seen as somewhat vague in a steering context. Since the mediation is not a judgement but a steering message, it is more appropriately evaluated under the steering metrics. The message is conciliatory and relevant, but it lacks specificity in guiding the conversation forward, which slightly reduces its effectiveness as a steering message.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the potential for cultural misunderstanding and encourages a more informed discussion by suggesting the sharing of resources or examples. The message is directly relevant to the conversation, as it addresses the underlying issue of cultural norms and practices. It is natural in context and could conceivably be written by a user aiming to facilitate a respectful dialogue. The message avoids taking sides and instead promotes understanding, which aligns with the goal of mediation.",
