    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation offers a nuanced perspective that acknowledges the complexity of the discussion. It recognizes that some individuals may act out of self-interest rather than genuine altruism, which is a reasonable and fair assessment of the conversation. The judgement does not outright dismiss the Ghanaian fans' actions as selfish but instead highlights the broader issue of social validation in good deeds. However, it does not clearly specify which side is entirely correct, which is acceptable given the context of the debate. The argument is well-reasoned and aligns with common moral principles of fairness and understanding different motivations. The mediation is not overly prescriptive but instead presents a balanced view that reflects the complexity of the issue.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to steer the conversation towards understanding rather than confrontation. It acknowledges the complexity of the issue and encourages reflection on motivations behind actions. However, it is somewhat vague and does not directly address the specific points of contention in the conversation. The message is natural in context but lacks specific guidance on how to move forward constructively. It avoids taking a clear stance but instead promotes a more reflective and empathetic approach, which aligns with the steering metrics. The message is not overly parental or generated, but it could be more direct in guiding the conversation.",
