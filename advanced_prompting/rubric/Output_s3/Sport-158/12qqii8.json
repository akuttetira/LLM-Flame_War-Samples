        "rationale": "The mediation provides a nuanced judgment that acknowledges both players' strengths. It recognizes Ronaldo's enduring cultural impact through his signature celebration and persona, while also acknowledging Messi's greatness. The judgment is balanced and does not outright dismiss either player's contributions. However, it does not definitively state which player is more memorable or greater, which aligns with the nuanced approach. The reasoning is fair and grounded in the conversation's context, though it could have been more explicit in its support for Ronaldo's cultural legacy. The judgment is not overly confident but is reasonable and fair.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to steer the conversation towards a more productive direction by focusing on football skills and achievements rather than personal celebrations. It acknowledges the debate but redirects it to a more objective topic. The message is relevant to the conversation, natural in context, and has a high chance of guiding positive dialogue. However, it is somewhat vague in its approach and does not directly address the specific arguments being made by the users. It avoids taking a clear stance on whether Messi or Ronaldo is more memorable or deserving of recognition, which is a strength in a steering message as it maintains neutrality. Overall, the message is effective in encouraging a more constructive discussion.",
