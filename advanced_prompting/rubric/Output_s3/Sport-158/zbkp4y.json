        "rationale": "The mediation provides a nuanced perspective that acknowledges the complexity of attributing national sports preferences to a single team's performance. It avoids a simplistic judgment and instead highlights the broader societal factors that influence sports culture. However, it does not clearly determine which side is correct in the original debate, nor does it provide a definitive conclusion. The message is fair and balanced, but it lacks a clear resolution or judgment, which is expected in a 'judgement' type mediation. It is well-worded and relevant to the conversation, though it remains neutral in its conclusion.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to steer the conversation towards a more constructive and inclusive discussion. It acknowledges the initial comments about soccer and the NFL without taking sides, and instead invites a broader discussion about why people might have different preferences. The message is naturally phrased and relevant to the conversation, encouraging participants to explore underlying reasons for their opinions. It does not impose a specific viewpoint but rather facilitates a dialogue that could lead to mutual understanding. While it is slightly vague in its approach, it is still productive and well-suited to the context of the conversation.",
