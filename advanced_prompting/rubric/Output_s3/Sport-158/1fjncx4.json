        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced assessment of the arguments presented, acknowledging that the new format could lead to more dead rubbers and less competitive games, while also recognizing the counterpoint about increased excitement and urgency. However, the mediation does not clearly determine which side is correct based on objective criteria, and the supporting arguments are not sufficiently detailed to justify a definitive conclusion. The judgement is neutral but lacks the depth to fully support a clear stance.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the passion for football and suggests a more focused discussion on specific teams or scenarios. This approach is relevant to the conversation and has a high chance of guiding positive dialogue. The message is natural in context and could conceivably be written by a user, as it avoids taking sides and encourages a more constructive exchange.",
