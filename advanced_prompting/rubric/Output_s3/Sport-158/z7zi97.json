        "rationale": "The mediation provides a nuanced judgment that acknowledges both sides of the argument. It recognizes that while Senegal's loss to the Dutch is a concern, it may not fully represent their potential against England, especially considering factors like player availability and team form. The judgment is balanced and does not definitively declare one side as correct, which aligns with the complexity of the debate. However, it could have been more explicit in explaining why the argument about the Dutch game is less conclusive. The reasoning is fair and grounded in the context of the conversation, though it could have provided stronger support for its position.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the debate around Senegal's chances against England, references the recent match against the Dutch, and encourages the participants to focus on factual arguments rather than absolute statements. The message is directly relevant to the conversation, guides positive dialogue by encouraging evidence-based reasoning, and is natural in the context of the discussion. It does not take a side but instead prompts a more constructive exchange, which aligns well with the steering role. The message is not overly parental or generated, and it effectively steers the conversation toward a more collaborative and informed discussion.",
