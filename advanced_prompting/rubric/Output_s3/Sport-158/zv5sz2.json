        "rationale": "The mediation provides a judgment that acknowledges the user's right to pride in their creative work and the other party's right to express their opinion. It correctly identifies that the user's perspective is more in line with common morality and fairness principles, as it respects the individual's achievement and creative choice. The judgment is clear and supports the user's position without being overly dismissive of the other side's comments. However, it could have been more nuanced in addressing the tone of the comments made by the other user, which included mocking and belittling language. Nonetheless, the overall judgment is fair and effective in this context.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to redirect the conversation towards the poster itself, which is the main topic of discussion. It avoids engaging in the personal or emotional exchanges that have occurred in the conversation. The message is natural in context and provides a productive direction for the conversation by encouraging the participants to share their own creations or favorites. However, it is somewhat vague in its guidance and does not explicitly address the specific points of contention mentioned in the conversation. It is not overly parental or computer-generated, but it could have been more specific in steering the dialogue towards a positive and constructive path.",
