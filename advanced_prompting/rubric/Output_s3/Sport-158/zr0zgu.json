        "rationale": "The mediation provides a clear judgment that the advertising process is a long-term endeavor, which is a reasonable and factual perspective. It correctly identifies the more credible argument that ads are planned months in advance, which aligns with common understanding of marketing practices. The judgment acknowledges the other side's concern but dismisses it as unfounded, which is fair given the context. The reasoning is supported by the argument that companies use results-based marketing, which is a standard industry practice. The judgment is neutral and does not take an extreme position, making it a balanced and fair assessment.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the participants' concerns while steering the conversation towards factual discussion. The message is relevant to the conversation, as it addresses the core issue of the ad's creation timeline and advertising processes. It is natural in context and could conceivably be written by a user aiming to facilitate a constructive dialogue. The message encourages a more rational and evidence-based discussion without dismissing the participants' feelings.",
