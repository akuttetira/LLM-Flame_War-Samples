    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a nuanced judgment that acknowledges the complexity of the situation by comparing two competing arguments. It evaluates the claim that the mass exodus is due to the protest being pointless and people getting bored as more convincing than the claim that it's due to corporate shills and mods brainwashing users. This judgment is reasonable and based on the content of the conversation, which includes comments from multiple users with differing perspectives. The mediation does not take an absolute stance but rather offers a comparative assessment of the two arguments, which is fair and balanced. However, it could have provided more explicit reasoning or evidence to support its conclusion, which slightly reduces its strength. Overall, the judgment is well-reasoned and fair.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to guide the conversation towards a more constructive direction. It acknowledges the current tension and encourages focusing on facts rather than personal attacks. The message is relevant to the conversation and natural in context, as it addresses the underlying issue of disagreement about the situation on Reddit. However, it is somewhat vague in its specific guidance and does not offer clear next steps or additional context to help the participants move forward. It is not overly parental or computer-generated, but it could have been more specific in its steering. Overall, it scores well in terms of being neutral and encouraging, but could be more direct in its guidance.",
