    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the person criticizing Louis Rossmann's community and attempting to engage in a constructive conversation is more in the right. The argument highlights the concern about fostering a racist community and the failure to engage in good faith, which aligns with principles of fairness and morality. The other side dismisses these concerns and resorts to personal attacks, which is less constructive. The judgement is clear and backed by the context of the conversation, making it a fair and accurate assessment.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to steer the conversation towards a more factual and constructive discussion. It acknowledges the potential for misinterpretation and encourages focusing on the impact of Louis' content rather than personal attacks. The message is relevant to the conversation and naturally fits the context, as it addresses the underlying tension between differing viewpoints. However, it is somewhat vague in its guidance and does not provide specific steps or direction for how to proceed. It avoids taking a strong stance but instead encourages a more neutral and fact-based discussion, which aligns with the goal of mediation. The message is not overly parental or generated, but it could have been more specific in its guidance.",
