        "rationale": "The mediation output attempts to balance the perspectives of both sides. It acknowledges that the company's actions may be more in line with corporate protocol, but also recognizes the validity of the outrage from those who have experienced systemic abuse. However, the judgement is somewhat vague and does not clearly specify which side is more correct. The reasoning is somewhat balanced but lacks concrete support for its position. The message is not overly parental or computer-generated, but it is not fully conciliatory or directly relevant to the conversation. It provides a middle ground but does not fully guide positive dialogue.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and attempts to steer the conversation towards a more nuanced discussion about workplace behavior. It acknowledges the tension between defending the company and addressing Madison's concerns, which is relevant to the conversation. However, it is somewhat vague and does not directly address the specific issues raised in the conversation, such as the role of HR, sexual harassment, and the dynamics between the company leadership and employees. The message is natural in context but could be more specific in guiding positive dialogue. It does not fully address the underlying conflicts or provide clear direction for moving forward.",
