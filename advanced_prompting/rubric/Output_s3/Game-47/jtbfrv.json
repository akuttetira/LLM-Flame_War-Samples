        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced view of the discussion, acknowledging that there are valid points on both sides of the issue. It recognizes the artistic intent behind the low frame rate as a deliberate choice to show Miles' growth, which is a key point in the conversation. However, it does not clearly determine which side is correct in a moral or factual sense, but instead offers a nuanced perspective. The judgement is fair and acknowledges the complexity of the issue without taking a definitive stance, which aligns with a 4 score in the judgement metric. The message is also conciliatory and relevant to the conversation, aiming to guide positive dialogue by highlighting the artistic intent. However, it could have been more specific in its guidance, which slightly reduces its score in the steering metric. Overall, it deserves a 4 in both metrics.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges differing opinions and encourages a focus on the art itself, which is relevant to the conversation. The message is natural in context and could conceivably be written by a user. It guides positive dialogue by shifting the focus to the animation style rather than personal opinions or technical details. The message is well-worded and maintains a neutral, respectful tone.",
