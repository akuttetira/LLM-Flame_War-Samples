    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a nuanced judgment that acknowledges the validity of criticism towards the game's writing and character development while also recognizing the dismissive and condescending nature of some responses. It does not outright declare one side as correct but instead evaluates the quality of the arguments presented. The judgment is well-reasoned and aligns with common morality and fairness principles, though it does not fully specify a clear right or wrong side. The supporting arguments are reasonable but not exhaustive, which slightly reduces its score from a 5 to a 4.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It addresses the issue of personal attacks and encourages respectful dialogue, which is directly relevant to the conversation. The message is natural in context and could conceivably be written by a user. It guides the conversation towards a more constructive direction without taking sides or imposing opinions. The message effectively promotes civility and respect in discussion, making it a strong example of a steering message.",
