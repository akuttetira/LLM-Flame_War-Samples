    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a nuanced judgment that acknowledges the complexity of the argument being made. It recognizes that accusing others of being shills or fanboys without evidence is less reasonable than interpreting a specific scene or detail. This reflects a fair and balanced approach, avoiding outright condemnation of one side while acknowledging the validity of the other perspective. The judgment is not definitive but offers a reasonable assessment of which approach is more constructive. However, it does not fully specify which side is correct in a moral or factual sense, which limits its score slightly.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The generated mediation is a steering message that aims to guide the conversation back to the central topic of the video in question. It does so by asking the participants to focus on their thoughts about the specific scene involving Ellie under the water. The message is conciliatory, neutral, and directly relevant to the conversation. It avoids taking sides and encourages a constructive dialogue by prompting the users to share their own perspectives. The message is natural in context and could conceivably be written by a user, making it effective in steering the conversation toward a more productive direction. However, it is somewhat vague in its request, as it does not explicitly ask for a discussion of the game's narrative or design choices, but rather focuses on the visual aspect. Despite this, the overall message is effective in its intent and tone.",
