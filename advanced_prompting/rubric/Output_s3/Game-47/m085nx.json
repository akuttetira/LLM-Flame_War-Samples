        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the initial downplayer of Women's Day, who implied that men's rights are more important, is more in the wrong. This aligns with common morality and fairness principles, as it recognizes the importance of Women's Day and the need to focus on gender equality. The judgement is clear and specific, and it appropriately criticizes the initial comment that undermines the purpose of Women's Day. However, the mediation does not provide detailed arguments to back up its position, which slightly reduces its score. Overall, the judgement is correct and fair.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the diversity of opinions in the conversation and encourages respectful dialogue. The message is directly relevant to the ongoing discussion and is natural in the context of the conversation. It avoids taking sides and instead promotes understanding and mutual respect, which aligns with the goal of mediation. The message is well-worded and would be believable as a user-generated response.",
