        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the PS5 is widely acknowledged as being objectively massive and ugly by multiple commenters, including those who compare it to previous consoles and reference specific sources. However, it does not fully resolve the debate between those who find it ugly and those who find it aesthetically pleasing. The mediation acknowledges the size and design concerns but does not clearly specify a definitive right or wrong in terms of design preference, which is a subjective matter. The judgement is fair and backed by the consensus of multiple users, but it does not fully address the subjective nature of design preferences.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the diversity of opinions on the PS5's design and size, and shifts the focus to features and performance. The message is directly relevant to the conversation, encourages constructive dialogue, and is natural in the context of the discussion. It does not take a side but instead promotes a balanced discussion, which aligns with the goal of mediation.",
