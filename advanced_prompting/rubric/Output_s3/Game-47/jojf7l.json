    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a judgement that the people defending Kena's release date and expressing disappointment are more in the right. This aligns with the context of the conversation, which is centered around the anticipation and uncertainty surrounding the release of Kena. The mediation acknowledges the valid concerns and emotions of those waiting for the game, as well as the confusion and misinformation that can arise in such situations. It does not take a position on the actual release date or the game's quality, but rather focuses on the emotional and informational context of the discussion. The judgement is fair and neutral, recognizing the validity of the concerns expressed by the users without endorsing or dismissing their opinions. However, it could have been more specific in explaining why the users expressing disappointment are considered more right, though this is not necessary for a 5. The message is concise and relevant to the conversation.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and attempts to foster a positive dialogue by acknowledging both excitement and frustration. It avoids taking sides and focuses on the broader excitement around the PS5 launch. However, it is somewhat vague and does not directly address the specific concerns raised in the conversation about Kena's release date and the PS5 launch. The message is natural in context but could be more specific in guiding the conversation towards a constructive direction.",
