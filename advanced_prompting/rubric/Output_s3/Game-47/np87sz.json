    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance the perspectives of both the person who deleted the friend and the person who made light of the situation. It acknowledges the validity of the friend deletion as a personal choice and the right to handle online relationships as one sees fit. It also recognizes the other person's attempt to lighten the mood, which can be seen as a form of empathy. However, the mediation does not clearly define which side is more in the right, and the reasoning is somewhat vague. It does not provide strong supporting arguments for either side, and the conclusion is somewhat ambiguous. The mediation is not entirely neutral, as it implies that the friend deletion was justified while also acknowledging the other person's perspective. Overall, the mediation is somewhat fair but lacks the clarity and strength needed for a high score.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to foster understanding and mutual respect. It acknowledges the importance of considering others' feelings and encourages learning from each other's experiences. However, it is somewhat vague and does not directly address the specific issues in the conversation, such as the emotional impact of friend deletions and the broader societal comments on online interactions. While it is natural in context and has a moderate chance of guiding positive dialogue, it lacks the specificity needed to effectively steer the conversation towards a more constructive direction.",
