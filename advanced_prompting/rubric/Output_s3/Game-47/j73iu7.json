        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the debate between closed captioning and subtitles is nuanced, and both sides have valid points. It acknowledges the complexity of the terminology without taking a definitive stance, which aligns with the context of the conversation where users are discussing technical terms in a friendly, albeit heated, manner. The message is neutral, avoids taking sides, and provides a balanced view that could guide the conversation towards a more constructive discussion. However, it is somewhat vague in its guidance and does not directly address the underlying conflict in the conversation, which is the confusion and disagreement over terminology. It is not overly parental or computer-generated, but it could have been more specific in its steering.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to shift the focus from the terminology debate to the content of the message. It is relevant to the conversation and has a high chance of guiding positive dialogue by encouraging participants to engage with the actual content rather than the semantics of 'subtitles' vs 'captions'. The message is natural in context and could conceivably be written by a user, making it a productive steering message. However, it does not explicitly address the underlying tension between the users (e.g., Jewishjewjuice and others) and does not directly resolve the conflict. It is slightly vague in its approach but still effective in redirecting the conversation.",
