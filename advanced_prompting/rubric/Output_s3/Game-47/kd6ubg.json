        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the PS5 controller flash feature was available on the PS4 in 2014, which aligns with the comments from users like [deleted], who point out that the feature was present on the PS4. This judgment is supported by multiple users confirming the feature's existence on previous consoles and the PS4. The mediation does not take a neutral position but clearly asserts that the PS4 users are correct, which is appropriate given the context of the discussion. The reasoning is sound and backed by the comments in the conversation.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the excitement around the PS5 controller and redirects the conversation towards the actual feature and its functionality. The message is relevant to the conversation, as it addresses the underlying issue of debate over the novelty of the feature. It is naturally phrased and would be believable as a user-generated message, encouraging a more focused and constructive discussion.",
