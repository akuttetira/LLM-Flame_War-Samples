        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced view of the discussion, acknowledging that both the feasibility and cost of 3D printing custom PS5 side panels have valid points. It correctly identifies that the initial claims of impossibility or ease are oversimplified, and that the discussion is more nuanced. The mediation does not take a clear stance on which side is correct but instead presents a balanced perspective, which aligns with the principles of fairness and neutrality. However, it does not fully specify a correct side or a neutral position in a way that clearly addresses the complexity of the issue. The message is well-structured and appropriate for the context, but could have been more explicit in its neutrality.",

        "rationale": "The steering message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the positive aspects of the conversation and suggests a direction for further discussion that could encourage collaboration and community engagement. The message is relevant to the conversation about custom PS5 designs and is naturally contextual, as it encourages further dialogue around potential community initiatives. It does not impose a specific viewpoint but rather opens up a space for more discussion, which aligns well with the topic at hand.",
