    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a nuanced judgment that acknowledges the complexity of the issue. It recognizes that while completely erasing hate speech may not be ideal, preserving hateful comments as evidence can have a role in holding individuals accountable. This approach is more balanced than a strict either/or stance. However, the mediation does not clearly determine which side is entirely correct, as it acknowledges the risks of allowing hate speech to persist. The argument is supported by the discussion in the conversation, where Bardfinn explains the moderation policies and the potential for third-party archiving systems to be untrustworthy. The judgment is reasonable but does not fully resolve the moral dilemma presented.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the complexity of the issue and encourages finding a middle ground. The message is directly relevant to the conversation and has a high chance of guiding positive dialogue. It is natural in context and could conceivably be written by a user. However, it does not provide specific guidance or actionable steps, which could be seen as vague. Overall, it meets the criteria for a 4 in the steering metric.",
