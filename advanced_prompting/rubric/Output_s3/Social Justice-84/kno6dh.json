        "rationale": "The mediation provides a nuanced judgment that acknowledges the complexity of the argument. It suggests that the meme might be more focused on the police rather than George Floyd, which is a reasonable interpretation given the context. However, it does not fully resolve the underlying debate about whether the meme is making fun of Floyd or the police. The judgment is somewhat supported by the conversation, but it lacks a clear, definitive conclusion and does not fully back up its position with strong moral or fairness-based arguments. Therefore, it earns a moderate score.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the complexity of the issue by distinguishing between making fun of the police and making fun of Floyd\u2019s death. The message is directly relevant to the conversation, as it encourages participants to focus on the specific meme in question. It is natural in context and could conceivably be written by a user, as it seeks to guide the discussion toward a more focused and respectful dialogue. The message effectively steers the conversation without taking sides, which is appropriate given the sensitive nature of the topic.",
