        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the side arguing Xinjiang genocide denial is a conspiracy theory, citing evidence from credible sources like China itself and survivor testimonies, is more in the right. The argument acknowledges the complexity of the issue, acknowledges the existence of contradictory testimonies, and explains that such contradictions can be due to factors like trauma and fear, rather than dishonesty. The mediation does not take a definitive stance on the truth of the genocide but rather emphasizes the importance of considering credible sources and the context of testimonies. The reasoning is well-supported by the conversation's content and is fair in acknowledging the complexity of the issue.",

It acknowledges the passion in the conversation and suggests a more constructive approach by focusing on facts and avoiding personal attacks. The message is directly relevant to the conversation and has a high chance of guiding positive dialogue. It is natural in context and could conceivably be written by a user. The message encourages mutual understanding and respect, which is appropriate for a discussion with strong opposing viewpoints.",
