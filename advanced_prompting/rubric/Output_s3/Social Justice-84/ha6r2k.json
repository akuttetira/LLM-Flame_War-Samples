    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a nuanced judgment that acknowledges the complexity of the issue. It correctly identifies that the claim about white moderators being disproportionately involved in policing black voices is more defensible than the blanket assertion that all mods are white. This reflects an understanding of the conversation's context, where the debate centers around the demographics of moderators and their role in enforcing norms. The judgment is fair and balanced, recognizing that while the claim about white moderators is more substantiated, the broader claim of all mods being white is too simplistic. The reasoning is supported by the conversation's references to specific moderators and the discussion around mod demographics. The message is clear and does not take an overly partisan stance.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the passion in the conversation and suggests a more constructive approach by focusing on specific examples and experiences. This aligns with the steering metrics by being directly relevant to the conversation and has a high chance of guiding positive dialogue. The message is natural in context and could conceivably be written by a user. It encourages a more nuanced and respectful discussion without taking sides, which is appropriate for the topic. The message does not attempt to judge who is correct but rather steers the conversation toward a more collaborative and constructive path.",
