        "rationale": "The mediation provides a general assessment of the subreddit's rules and the nature of the comments, but it does not directly address the specific controversy between the users. It does not clearly determine which side is correct based on morality or fairness, nor does it provide a detailed justification for its position. The message is somewhat neutral but lacks the specificity and depth needed to be a strong judgment. It is not overly partisan or biased, but it does not fully meet the criteria for a 5. It is more of a 3 because it does not clearly specify a correct side or provide strong supporting arguments, though it is not entirely wrong.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It shifts the focus back to the original issue of misinformation about the pandemic, which is the central topic of the conversation. The message encourages a constructive discussion by asking for specific examples of false information and how to correct it, which is relevant and has a high chance of guiding positive dialogue. The tone is neutral and appropriate for the context of the conversation, and it avoids any personal attacks or divisive language. The message is natural and could conceivably be written by a user aiming to facilitate a productive discussion.",
