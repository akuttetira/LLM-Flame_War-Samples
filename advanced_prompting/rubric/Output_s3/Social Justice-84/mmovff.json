        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that Kelekona's perspective is more nuanced and effective in addressing the issue of hate groups. It acknowledges the complexity of dealing with hate groups and the importance of engagement over ostracization. The judgement is based on a reasonable analysis of the arguments presented, recognizing that while NuclearOops emphasizes the dangers of hate speech, Kelekona provides a more balanced approach that considers the potential benefits of engagement. The judgement is well-supported by the conversation and does not take an extreme stance, making it a fair and reasonable assessment.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to foster a balanced discussion between the participants. It acknowledges the complexities of dealing with hate groups and suggests learning from each other's experiences. The message is relevant to the conversation and encourages a constructive dialogue. However, it is somewhat vague in its approach and does not provide specific guidance on how to achieve the balance mentioned. The tone is natural and seems to be in line with the context of the conversation, but it lacks the specificity needed for a 5. It is not overly parental or generated, so it deserves a 4 in the steering metric.",
