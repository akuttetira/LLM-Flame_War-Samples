    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a nuanced judgment that acknowledges the complexity of the discussion. It correctly identifies the argument about virgin shaming as a form of psychological projection as more compelling, which aligns with common morality and fairness principles. The judgment does not take an absolute stance but rather offers a balanced perspective, which is appropriate given the context of the conversation. However, it does not fully resolve the underlying tensions between the different viewpoints presented, and the supporting arguments are not as detailed as they could be. The judgment is fair and reasonable but could have been more comprehensive.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to guide the conversation towards a more positive and open dialogue. It acknowledges the shift in the conversation from a joke to a deeper discussion about personal experiences and psychological issues. The message suggests exploring shared stories or experiences, which can help foster understanding and empathy. However, it is somewhat vague in its guidance and does not directly address the specific points of contention in the conversation. It is natural in context but could have been more specific in suggesting how to proceed. It scores a 4 on the steering metric because it is conciliatory and relevant but lacks direct guidance on how to move forward in the conversation.",
