    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the user 'judethedude781' is more in the right by pointing out the hypocrisy of conflating criticism of China with support for US foreign policy. The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the issue, recognizing that one can be opposed to both the US military-industrial complex and China's human rights abuses without being a 'bootlicking shill' for either side. The judgement is supported by the context of the conversation, where 'judethedude781' clearly distinguishes between opposing government actions and not conflating them with the actions of citizens. The mediation also correctly notes the fallacy of relative privation, which is a key point in the debate. The judgement is well-reasoned and aligns with the arguments presented in the conversation.",
