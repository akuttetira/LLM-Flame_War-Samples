        "rationale": "The mediation provides a nuanced judgment that acknowledges the complexity of the argument regarding the spread of misinformation. It correctly identifies that the claim about people seeking a reason to reject norms is more nuanced than the simplistic view of people looking for an excuse to riot. This reflects an understanding of the psychological and social dynamics at play. The judgment is fair and does not take a sides but rather highlights the complexity of the issue, which is appropriate given the context of the conversation. The reasoning is sound and aligns with common morality and fairness principles.",
