        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument against tolerating racism, even when disguised as humor, is more compelling. The judgment aligns with common morality and fairness principles by emphasizing the need to address real-world racism and hate speech. The mediation does not take a neutral position but clearly supports the side that advocates for calling out racism. The supporting arguments are strong, citing real examples of racism and the existence of hate-filled subreddits. The judgment is well-reasoned and backed by the context of the conversation, making it a clear and fair assessment.",

The message is relevant to the conversation, natural in context, and could conceivably be written by a user. It encourages a balanced discussion without taking sides, which aligns with the goal of mediation.",
