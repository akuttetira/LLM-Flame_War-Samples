    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the 'shoot to kill' doctrine is not supported by the discussion. The conversation presents a range of perspectives on the use of lethal force by police, including arguments about the justification of using lethal force and the excessive use of force. The mediation accurately reflects that there is no clear consensus in the discussion that supports the 'shoot to kill' doctrine as more justifiable. The judgement is neutral and does not take a side, which aligns with the complexity of the issue discussed. The mediation is well-reasoned and based on the content of the conversation, making it a fair and accurate assessment.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The generated mediation provides a conciliatory message that acknowledges the common concern about the 'shoot to kill' doctrine in US police force. It suggests focusing on specific examples rather than debating the philosophy, which is relevant and productive. The message is natural in context and could conceivably be written by a user, making it a good steering message. However, it is somewhat vague in its suggestion and does not offer specific guidance on how to proceed with the conversation. It avoids taking a strong stance and encourages a more practical approach, which is positive.",
