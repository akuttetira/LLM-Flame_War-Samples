        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced view of both MGTOW and incel ideologies, acknowledging the valid points made by both sides while also pointing out the inflammatory rhetoric. It recognizes the emotional pain underlying the discussions without taking a clear side, which aligns with a neutral and nuanced position. The message is constructive and does not attempt to dictate a moral judgment but instead encourages a more thoughtful dialogue. However, it does not fully resolve the debate or provide a clear conclusion, which slightly reduces its effectiveness as a mediation. Overall, it is fair and neutral but lacks the strength to fully guide the conversation towards a resolution.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to foster understanding between the two groups. It acknowledges the complexity of the ideologies and suggests a path towards common ground. However, it is somewhat vague and does not directly address the specific points of contention in the conversation. The message is natural in context but lacks specificity in guiding the conversation towards a more productive dialogue. It does not provide clear direction or actionable steps for the participants to move forward, which slightly reduces its effectiveness as a steering message.",
