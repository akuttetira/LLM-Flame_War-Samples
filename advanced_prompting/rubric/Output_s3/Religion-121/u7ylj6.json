        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced view that acknowledges the complexity of the discussion around consciousness and the material world. It suggests that the argument for non-material consciousness is more defensible than the outright dismissal of such ideas. However, the mediation does not clearly determine which side is correct, and the reasoning is somewhat vague. It neither provides strong supporting arguments for one side nor clearly states a neutral position. The message is somewhat neutral but lacks the depth and clarity needed for a high score in fairness and neutrality.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the complexity of the discussion and suggests a path towards finding common ground. The message is directly relevant to the conversation and has a high chance of guiding positive dialogue. It is natural in context of the conversation and could conceivably be written by a user.",
