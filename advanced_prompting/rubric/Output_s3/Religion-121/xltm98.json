        "rationale": "The mediation output provides a nuanced judgment that acknowledges the complexity of the issue. It correctly identifies that dismissing the emotional impact of suicidal ideation and blaming the person for not being able to cope is more hurtful and unhelpful than the initial claim about the church\u2019s response. The judgment is based on common morality and fairness principles, recognizing the sensitivity of the topic and the importance of empathy in mental health discussions. However, it does not fully specify a clear correct side but rather offers a balanced perspective, which is appropriate given the context. The judgment is well-supported by the context of the conversation, which includes personal accounts of mental health struggles and the impact of religious beliefs on suicidal thoughts. The mediation is not a direct judgment on which side is correct but rather a recognition of the harm caused by certain responses. This approach is fair and considers the moral implications of the discussion.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It shifts the focus to shared concern for mental health and encourages personal stories or resources, which can foster empathy and understanding. The message is directly relevant to the conversation, as it addresses the underlying issue of mental health struggles and seeks to create a space for constructive dialogue. It is natural in context and could conceivably be written by a user aiming to facilitate a more supportive discussion. The message avoids taking sides and instead promotes a collaborative approach, which is appropriate given the sensitive nature of the conversation.",
