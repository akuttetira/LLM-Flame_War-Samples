        "rationale": "The mediation provides a nuanced judgment that acknowledges the complexity of the debate. It recognizes that the argument for a rational explanation of the resurrection is more aligned with critical thinking and evidence-based reasoning, while the other side dismisses the possibility of supernatural events without considering evidence. The judgment is balanced and does not take an absolute stance, which is appropriate given the philosophical and evidential nature of the discussion. However, it does not clearly specify which side is entirely correct, which is acceptable in a nuanced debate. The reasoning is sound and aligns with common principles of critical thinking and fairness.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to foster a more nuanced dialogue. It acknowledges the complexity of the topics being discussed and encourages a shift away from binary labels like 'believers' or 'non-believers'. The message is relevant to the conversation, as the discussion revolves around differing perspectives on morality, the resurrection, and the existence of God. The tone is natural and avoids being overly parental or robotic, making it suitable for a mediation context. However, it is somewhat vague in its specific guidance and does not provide clear next steps for the conversation. It could be more helpful if it suggested specific areas to explore or ways to engage more constructively with the opposing viewpoints.",
