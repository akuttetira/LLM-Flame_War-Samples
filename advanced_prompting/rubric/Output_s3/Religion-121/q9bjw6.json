    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument based on the lack of clear proof being evidence of a higher power's existence is more defensible than the dismissive and uncivil stance. The judgement acknowledges the complexity of the religious belief vs. skepticism debate, and recognizes that dismissing a viewpoint as 'disgusting and awful' without engaging with the arguments is less defensible. The mediation does not take a definitive side but rather evaluates the strength of the arguments presented, which aligns with fairness and neutrality. However, it could have provided more specific reasoning for why the argument about lack of proof is more defensible, though it is still a valid and fair assessment.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the heated tone of the conversation and suggests a constructive approach by focusing on ideas rather than personal attacks. The message is directly relevant to the conversation and has a high chance of guiding positive dialogue. It is natural in context and could conceivably be written by a user. The message encourages respectful dialogue and helps to steer the conversation back to the main topic of discussion.",
