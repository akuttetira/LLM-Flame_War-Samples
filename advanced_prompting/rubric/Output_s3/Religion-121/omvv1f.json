    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced assessment of both sides, acknowledging the problematic nature of both perspectives. It recognizes that the argument for a benevolent deity demanding submission and pain is more defensible than the claim that such a deity is an evil lord. However, it does not clearly determine which side is correct based on common morality and fairness principles, nor does it provide strong backing for its position. The judgement is neutral but lacks the depth to fully resolve the moral dilemma presented. The message is fair and balanced but not sufficiently grounded in clear moral reasoning.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the emotional tone of the conversation and suggests a more constructive direction by focusing on the implications of a hypothetical afterlife on moral frameworks. The message is relevant to the conversation and has a high chance of guiding positive dialogue. It is natural in context and could conceivably be written by a user, avoiding the overly parental or computer-generated tone. The message effectively steers the conversation towards a more neutral and analytical discussion rather than personal attacks or emotional reactions.",
