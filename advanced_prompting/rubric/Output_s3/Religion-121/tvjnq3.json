    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a nuanced judgment that acknowledges the complexity of the argument. It recognizes that the claim about Abrahamic God's commands being morally reprehensible is more compelling, which aligns with common morality and fairness principles. However, it does not fully address the counterargument that the context of war and cultural differences should be considered. The judgment is specific but lacks strong backing arguments that directly reference the ethical implications of the verses cited. The mediation is not a definitive judgment but rather a balanced assessment of the arguments presented.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is a moderate attempt to steer the conversation back to the specific commandments and their implications. It acknowledges the divergence in the conversation and suggests a more focused discussion. However, it is somewhat vague and does not directly address the underlying issues or provide clear guidance on how to proceed. The message is not overly parental or computer-generated, but it lacks the specificity needed to effectively guide the conversation towards a more constructive direction. It is relevant but not highly productive in guiding positive dialogue.",
