    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced view of the discussion, acknowledging that both sides present selective and biased information. It correctly identifies the issue as a mired debate in misinterpretation and misrepresentation, and suggests the need for a nuanced understanding of the historical and textual context. However, it does not provide a clear judgment on which side is correct, nor does it offer specific arguments or references to support its position. The message is neutral and does not attempt to steer the conversation in a particular direction, which is appropriate given the complexity of the issue. However, it lacks the specificity and guidance that would be necessary to effectively resolve the debate.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to steer the conversation towards a more productive discussion about the historical context and theological complexities of the Quran and jihad. It avoids personal attacks and encourages a focus on the text and its historical context. However, it is somewhat vague and does not directly address the specific points of contention between the participants. The message is natural in context but could have been more specific in guiding the conversation towards a resolution.",
