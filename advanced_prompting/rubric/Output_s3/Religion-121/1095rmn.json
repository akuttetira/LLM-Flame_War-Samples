        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that Mangalz's broad generalizations about atheists are more problematic than the original claim. The judgement acknowledges the original argument about applying evidence standards to religion and critiques Mangalz's approach as overly broad and potentially dismissive. However, it does not fully resolve the underlying debate about the validity of the original claim or provide a clear, neutral position. The judgement is fair and acknowledges the complexity of the issue, but it does not fully back up its position with detailed reasoning. It specifies a correct side (the original claim) but does not fully elaborate on why it is correct, which slightly reduces its score.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the heated discussion and redirects the conversation back to the original point about differing standards of evidence. The message is relevant to the conversation and has a high chance of guiding positive dialogue. It is natural in context and could conceivably be written by a user. The message encourages focus on the central issue without personal attacks, which is appropriate for the discussion. However, it is somewhat vague in its guidance and does not provide specific direction on how to proceed with the discussion.",
