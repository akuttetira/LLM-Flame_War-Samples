        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance the discussion by acknowledging the complexity of understanding a divine being and the limitations of human comprehension. It suggests that the argument for God's existence is more defensible than the outright dismissal of it. However, the mediation is somewhat vague and does not clearly specify which side is more reasonable. It lacks concrete arguments or references to the conversation to support its position. The message is not overly parental or computer-generated, but it is not as direct or productive as it could be. It does not clearly guide the conversation towards a more constructive dialogue.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the shift in the conversation and suggests exploring complementary perspectives on faith and skepticism. The message is relevant to the conversation and has a high chance of guiding positive dialogue. It is natural in context of the conversation and could conceivably be written by a user.",
