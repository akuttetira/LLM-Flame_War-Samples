        "rationale": "The mediation provides a judgment that the person questioning the morality of child marriage and the Prophet's actions is more in the right. This judgment acknowledges the ethical concerns raised about child marriage and the Prophet's actions, which are widely considered problematic by modern standards. However, it does not fully address the counterargument that cultural relativism should be considered when evaluating historical figures. The judgment is somewhat nuanced but lacks strong backing arguments to fully support its position. The mediation does not fully align with common morality and fairness principles, as it does not fully consider the context of the time period and the cultural norms of the 7th century. The judgment is somewhat correct but lacks sufficient support.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the strong emotions on both sides and encourages a focus on specific issues rather than personal attacks. The message is directly relevant to the conversation and has a high chance of guiding positive dialogue. It is natural in context and could conceivably be written by a user.",
