        "rationale": "The mediation provides a judgement that the person presenting evidence and criticizing others for not taking it seriously is more in the right. This judgement is based on the argument that the other side is dismissing supernatural events in the Bible without evidence. However, the mediation does not fully back up its position with clear moral or fairness principles. The argument that parapsychology is a pseudoscience is a complex and controversial topic, and the mediation does not provide a balanced or neutral perspective. The judgement is somewhat supportive of the person presenting evidence but lacks strong supporting arguments and does not fully address the nuances of the debate.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to guide the conversation towards more productive dialogue by suggesting the user look into scientific consensus and reputable researchers. It acknowledges the frustration of dismissing fields without research and offers a constructive alternative. However, it is somewhat vague in its suggestion and does not directly address the specific points of contention in the conversation. The message is natural in context but could be more specific in recommending credible sources or addressing the underlying issues of pseudoscience versus legitimate research. It has a moderate chance of guiding positive dialogue.",
