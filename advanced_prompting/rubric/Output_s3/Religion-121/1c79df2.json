        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced view, acknowledging that evolution is a well-supported scientific theory and that theists may hold atheists to a higher standard of evidence. It correctly identifies that the argument about evolution being a fact is more defensible than the claim that atheists are inherently biased. However, the mediation does not fully address the nuances of the debate, such as the scientific validity of creationism or the specific claims made by the participants. The judgement is fair and reasonable but could have been more comprehensive in addressing the complexities of the discussion.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to steer the conversation towards a more constructive direction by emphasizing the shared goal of understanding the world. It acknowledges the value of the discussion and encourages a focus on common ground. However, it is somewhat vague and does not directly address the specific points of contention between the participants. The message is natural in context but lacks specific guidance on how to proceed, making it somewhat generic in its approach. It has a medium chance of guiding positive dialogue but is not as direct or specific as it could be.",
