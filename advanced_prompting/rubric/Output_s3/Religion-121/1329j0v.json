    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance both sides of the argument by acknowledging the cultural and biological differences of the 7th century while also recognizing the importance of historical context and Hadiths. However, it does not clearly determine which side is correct based on common morality and fairness principles. The mediation is somewhat neutral but lacks strong supporting arguments for either position, making it a middle ground. It is somewhat fair but not fully convincing in its judgment.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It addresses the core issue of a 9-year-old being married to a 53-year-old man, which is a serious ethical concern. The message encourages respectful dialogue by asking for a focus on the issue itself rather than personal attacks or gaslighting. It is relevant to the conversation and natural in context, as it acknowledges the gravity of the situation while promoting a constructive discussion. The message is well-worded and would be credible if written by a user, making it a strong example of a steering message.",
