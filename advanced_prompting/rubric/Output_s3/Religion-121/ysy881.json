    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a nuanced judgment that acknowledges the complexity of the debate. It recognizes that non-acts (thoughts or desires) can be considered sinful, as supported by references to Jesus' teachings on lust. It also challenges the blanket claim that homosexuality is inherently immoral, which is a fair and balanced approach. The judgment is not definitive but offers a more defensible position based on the arguments presented. However, it does not fully resolve the moral dilemma or provide a clear-cut conclusion, which slightly reduces its score.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the complexity of the discussion and suggests a more nuanced approach to morality. The message is relevant to the conversation and has a high chance of guiding positive dialogue. It is natural in context and could conceivably be written by a user. The message does not take sides but encourages a broader perspective, which is appropriate for a steering message in this context.",
