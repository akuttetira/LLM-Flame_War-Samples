        "rationale": "The mediation provides a nuanced judgment that acknowledges the complexity of the issue. It recognizes that while the Quran is considered infallible, the practical implications of its advice on milk consumption must be considered in light of modern scientific understanding, including lactose intolerance. The judgment does not outright dismiss the Quran's guidance but instead suggests that the argument about the advice being flawed is more defensible. However, it does not fully resolve the debate between religious infallibility and scientific evidence, leaving room for further discussion. The judgment is balanced and acknowledges the limitations of both perspectives.",
