    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the person defending the OP's decision to set boundaries with their mother is more in the right, as it acknowledges the importance of personal autonomy and the potential for abuse. The judgement recognizes the complexity of the situation, balancing the OP's right to set boundaries with the need to be cautious about making broad generalizations about 'normal' behavior. However, the mediation does not fully address the ethical concerns raised by the comment about pedophilia and the context of the conversation. It also does not explicitly condemn the comment that was later removed for advocating abusive practices. Overall, the judgement is fair and nuanced, but could have been more comprehensive in addressing the ethical nuances of the discussion.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the complexity of physical touch and comfort levels, while focusing on supporting the original poster (OP) and their decision to set boundaries. The message avoids taking sides in the debate about what is 'normal' or 'acceptable' and instead redirects the conversation towards a more constructive and empathetic direction. It is naturally contextual and would be appropriate for a user to say in this situation, as it encourages positive dialogue and respect for personal boundaries.",
