        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced view, acknowledging the complexity of the issue and recognizing valid points on both sides of the debate around cancel culture. It does not take a firm stance on which side is correct but instead highlights the nuances of the discussion. The message is neutral and does not attempt to resolve the conflict, which is appropriate given the complexity of the topic. However, it does not offer a clear path forward or specific guidance, which could be seen as a minor shortcoming in terms of being more directive. Overall, the message is fair and impartial, reflecting the complexity of the issue without taking a definitive position.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to guide the conversation towards a more nuanced discussion. It acknowledges the complexity of cancel culture and emphasizes the importance of accountability while encouraging a balanced perspective. However, it is somewhat vague and does not directly address the specific points of contention in the conversation. The message is natural in context but lacks specific guidance on how to move forward in the discussion. It does not provide clear direction or actionable steps, which could have made it more effective. Overall, it is a reasonable attempt to steer the conversation but falls short of being highly specific or actionable.",
