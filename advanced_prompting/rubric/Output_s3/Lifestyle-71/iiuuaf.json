        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the OP's perspective on the lasting impact of trauma and the necessity of justice regardless of time passed is more valid and understanding. It acknowledges the ongoing effects of abuse and the importance of seeking closure, which aligns with common morality and fairness principles. The judgement is supported by the OP's detailed account of how the abuse has affected her life, including her mental health and relationships. The mediation does not dismiss the OP's experience but rather emphasizes the continued relevance of seeking justice. However, it does not explicitly state that the other comments were wrong, which could be seen as a slight lack of directness. Overall, the judgement is well-reasoned and aligns with the context of the conversation.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the community's support for the OP and redirects the conversation towards the OP's healing journey and the importance of holding abusers accountable. The message is directly relevant to the conversation, encourages positive dialogue, and is natural in context. It avoids engaging in a debate about the statute of limitations, which was a point of contention in the thread, and instead focuses on the positive aspects of the OP's journey. The message is respectful and supportive, which aligns with the overall tone of the conversation.",
