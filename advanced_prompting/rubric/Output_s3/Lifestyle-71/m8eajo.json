    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument supporting the impact of a single traumatic event is more in line with the values of support and inclusivity, which aligns with the context of a support group for abuse victims. It also acknowledges the transphobic language and the backlash against it, which is appropriate given the subreddit's guidelines. The judgement is clear, backed by the context of the conversation, and reflects the values of the community. However, it could have provided more detailed reasoning or references to specific research or principles to fully back up its position. Overall, it is a fair and accurate judgement based on the context provided.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to steer the conversation back to the original topic of trauma. It acknowledges the importance of the original point while discouraging personal attacks and hate speech. The message is relevant to the conversation and provides a clear direction for respectful dialogue. However, it is somewhat vague in its specific guidance and does not offer detailed examples or further context to help the participants engage constructively. The message is natural in context but could be more specific to better guide the conversation.",
