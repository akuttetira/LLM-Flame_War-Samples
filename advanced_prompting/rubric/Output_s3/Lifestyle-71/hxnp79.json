        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the experiences shared by the users regarding emotional manipulation and control by narcissistic parents are more in line with common morality and fairness principles. The judgement acknowledges the harm caused by such parental behavior and recognizes the validity of the experiences shared. It does not take a stance on the specific actions of the users but rather supports the broader context of narcissistic parenting. The judgement is well-supported by the content of the conversation, which consistently highlights the negative impact of such behavior on the individuals involved.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the shared experiences of the users and encourages a positive, supportive dialogue. The message is relevant to the conversation, as it addresses the core issue of toxic parenting and promotes healing. It is natural in context and could conceivably be written by a user. The message avoids taking a strong stance on which side is correct, instead focusing on unity and support, which aligns with the nature of the discussion. It does not impose any specific viewpoint but rather fosters a sense of community and understanding.",
