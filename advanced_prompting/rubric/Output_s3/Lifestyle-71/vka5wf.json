        "rationale": "The mediation provides a judgement that the argument for releasing personal medical history without consent is more misguided. This aligns with common morality and fairness principles, as respecting privacy and consent is a fundamental right. The judgement acknowledges the cringe factor of the proposal but does not fully address the underlying concerns about transparency or the potential harm of releasing sensitive information. It does not clearly specify a correct side but rather evaluates the reasoning behind the arguments. The support for the judgement is reasonable but not exhaustive, which places it in the 3 category for judgement metrics. The message is neutral and does not attempt to steer the conversation, so it does not meet the criteria for steering metrics.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It shifts the focus to a neutral topic (transparency vs privacy) and suggests a constructive discussion about the ethical boundaries of information release. The message is relevant to the conversation, directly addresses the tension between transparency and privacy, and encourages a thoughtful dialogue. It is natural in context and could conceivably be written by a user aiming to guide the conversation toward a more constructive direction.",
