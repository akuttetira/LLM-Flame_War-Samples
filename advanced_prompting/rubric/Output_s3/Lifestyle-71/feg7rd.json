    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a judgment that suggests the person dismissing the 'I love you' gesture is more in the right. This is based on the argument that a hug is a more genuine emotional gesture than a simple phrase. However, the judgment lacks clear support from the conversation itself. The original conversation does not provide enough context to determine which gesture is more effective or meaningful. The mediation assumes a value judgment about what is 'genuine' without sufficient backing from the dialogue. While the judgment is somewhat neutral, it is not fully supported by the conversation's content, which makes it less convincing. The score is a 3 because the judgment correctly identifies a side as more in the right but does not have strong backing arguments.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to shift the conversation from mockery to sharing personal experiences. It acknowledges the emotional aspect of the discussion and encourages empathy. However, it is somewhat vague in its guidance and does not directly address the specific issue of using 'I love you' to end calls. The message is natural in context but could be more specific in guiding positive dialogue. It scores a 4 on the steering metric because it is conciliatory and relevant, but lacks the directness and specificity needed for a 5.",
