    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the person advocating for friends to remember and respect the OP's specific boundary is more in the right. The argument is based on the principle of respecting personal boundaries and the emotional impact of using terms that trigger someone. The mediation acknowledges the OP's experience and the importance of respecting their request, which aligns with common morality and fairness principles. The judgement is clear and supports the perspective that respecting personal boundaries is important, even if it may be challenging for others to do so.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and attempts to foster understanding between the parties. It acknowledges the OP's efforts to communicate their boundaries and emphasizes respect for differences in communication styles. However, it is somewhat vague and does not directly address the specific issue of using 'father' versus 'dad' in this context. The message is natural in the context of the conversation but lacks specificity in guiding positive dialogue around the core issue. It does not provide clear direction on how to handle the situation more effectively, which limits its effectiveness as a steering message.",
