        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the experiences shared by individuals about being controlled or manipulated by their parents are more in the right. The judgement acknowledges the validity of the struggles described, which include emotional manipulation, lack of privacy, and parental control. The mediation does not take a stance on whether these experiences are universally true or not, but rather recognizes the validity of the experiences shared. The judgement is supported by the numerous anecdotes and personal stories shared in the conversation, which highlight the negative impact of such control on individuals' mental health and personal space. The mediation is fair and neutral, as it does not dismiss the experiences of those who have been controlled by their parents but also does not take a position that would invalidate their experiences.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the shared experiences of the users and encourages a supportive environment for sharing stories without judgment. The message is directly relevant to the conversation, which revolves around personal experiences with parental control and privacy issues. It is natural in context and could conceivably be written by a user. The message promotes positive dialogue by emphasizing support and understanding among the participants.",
