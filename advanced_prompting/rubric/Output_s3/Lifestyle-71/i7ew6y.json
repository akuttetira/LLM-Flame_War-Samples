        "rationale": "The mediation provides a nuanced judgment that acknowledges the complexity of the issue. It correctly identifies that praising single mothers for being single mothers is problematic, while also recognizing that some fathers are not worthy of recognition. This balanced approach reflects an understanding of the moral and social nuances involved. The judgment is not overly one-sided and does not dismiss the validity of either perspective entirely. However, it could have been more explicit in its reasoning and less ambiguous in its conclusion. The mediation is fair and reasonable but could be more definitive in its stance.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to steer the conversation towards a more inclusive and supportive discussion about single parents. It avoids taking sides in the debate between praising single moms and criticizing 'father' figures, which is appropriate given the context of the original conversation. The message is relevant to the discussion, encourages respect for all parents, and promotes a neutral, supportive tone. However, it is somewhat vague in its specific guidance and does not directly address the underlying tensions in the conversation, such as the critique of 'father' figures or the debate over whether being a father is meaningful. While it is natural in context, it could have been more specific in guiding the conversation towards the OP's request to 'stop praising single moms just for being single moms.' Overall, it is a reasonable steering message that maintains neutrality and encourages positive dialogue.",
