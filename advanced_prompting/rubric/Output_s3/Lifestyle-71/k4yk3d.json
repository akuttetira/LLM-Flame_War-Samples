    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a clear judgment that the person recognizing the manipulative tactics and willing to set boundaries is more in the right. This aligns with common morality and fairness principles, as it emphasizes the importance of self-respect and healthy boundaries in relationships. The judgment is supported by the context of the conversation, which revolves around identifying and addressing narcissistic behaviors. However, the mediation is somewhat vague in its explanation of why the other party is not in the right, and it does not fully address the complexity of the situation. The judgment is neutral in the sense that it does not assign blame but rather focuses on the importance of setting boundaries. Overall, the judgment is well-reasoned and aligns with the principles of fairness and self-respect.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the importance of recognizing manipulation and setting boundaries, which are key points in the conversation. The message encourages focusing on supporting the OP and providing helpful advice rather than getting caught up in debates about who's right or wrong. It is directly relevant to the conversation and has a high chance of guiding positive dialogue. The message is natural in context and could conceivably be written by a user.",
