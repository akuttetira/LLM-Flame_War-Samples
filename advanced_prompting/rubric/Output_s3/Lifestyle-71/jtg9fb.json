        "rationale": "The mediation provides a judgment that acknowledges both the person who called the police and the person defending their actions as being in the right. The reasoning is based on the context of domestic violence, which is a clear case of a serious and harmful situation. The mediation correctly identifies the need for support and protection for the OP, which aligns with common morality and fairness principles. However, the mediation does not clearly specify which side is in the right, but rather suggests that both are justified. This nuance is appropriate given the context of a traumatic experience being discussed in a support group. The judgment is well-supported by the situation described and aligns with ethical standards. The mediation is not a steering message but a judgment, so the steering metrics are not applicable here. The judgment is fair, effective, and neutral in context.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to steer the conversation towards a constructive direction by focusing on supporting the OP and discussing strategies for future situations. It is relevant to the context of the conversation, which involves a traumatic experience and the need for emotional support. The message is natural in tone and could conceivably be written by a user, as it encourages a positive and supportive dialogue. However, it is somewhat vague in its approach and does not directly address the underlying issues or conflicts in the conversation. It provides a general prompt without specific guidance, which may limit its effectiveness in guiding the conversation towards resolution.",
