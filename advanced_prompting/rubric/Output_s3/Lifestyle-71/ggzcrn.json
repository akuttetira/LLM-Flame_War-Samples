        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the person who connected their personal experience to the broader cultural issue of materialism is more in the right. This aligns with the principles of fairness and morality, as it acknowledges the validity of personal experiences and the impact of cultural norms. The other party's response is dismissive and fails to engage with the deeper issues raised. The judgement is clear and supported by the context of the conversation, which emphasizes the importance of not invalidating someone's values based on their life experiences.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the complexity of the situation and redirects the conversation towards supporting OP, which aligns with the subreddit's purpose. The message is natural in context and could conceivably be written by a user, as it avoids taking sides and focuses on fostering understanding. It effectively steers the conversation back to the original goal of providing support and empathy, which is crucial in this context.",
