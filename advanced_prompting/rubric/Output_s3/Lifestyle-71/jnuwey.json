    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the person who recognizes the manipulation and refuses to engage with the toxic behavior is in the right. The judgement is supported by the conversation, which shows how the toxic behavior is being used to manipulate and control others. The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the situation but clearly states that refusing to engage in toxic behavior is the correct approach. The judgement is neutral and does not take a side in a way that would be seen as biased.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the toxic cycle and encourages focusing on supporting each other. The message is relevant to the conversation and has a high chance of guiding positive dialogue. It is natural in context of the conversation and could conceivably be written by a user.",
