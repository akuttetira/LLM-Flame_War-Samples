    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that Jade's argument is more defensible. The key point is that the items were donated by mistake, not stolen, and Jade purchased them in good faith. Alice's argument that Jade should return the items and face prosecution for possession of stolen goods is not supported by the evidence, as the items were not stolen. The mediation also acknowledges the nuance of the situation, recognizing that the items were not stolen and that Jade's actions were legally sound. The argument is well-supported by the context provided in the conversation, where it is confirmed that the items were accidentally donated and not stolen. The mediation does not take a neutral position but clearly supports Jade's side based on the evidence.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and attempts to steer the conversation back to the facts. It acknowledges Alice's history of shutting down threads and deleting comments, which is relevant to the context. However, the message is somewhat vague in its guidance and does not directly suggest a productive path forward. It also does not clearly address the legal nuances of the situation, which could be important for a fair discussion. The message is natural in context but lacks specific direction for moving the conversation forward in a constructive manner.",
