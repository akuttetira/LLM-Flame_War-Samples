        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument against ABA being abusive and traumatic for autistic individuals is more in line with the experiences and perspectives of the autistic community and those who have faced harm from ABA. The mediation acknowledges the valid concerns raised by the autistic individuals and their advocates, which are supported by the references to harmful practices in ABA therapy. The judgement is backed by the context of the conversation where multiple users share their negative experiences with ABA and the harm it has caused. The mediation does not take a neutral position but rather supports the side that highlights the abusive nature of ABA, which is justified based on the information provided in the conversation. The judgement is well-supported and aligns with the common morality and fairness principles of respecting the autonomy and well-being of autistic individuals.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the shared experiences of dealing with controlling family members and encourages a focus on support and understanding rather than debate. The message is relevant to the conversation, promotes kindness, and is natural in the context of the discussion. It effectively steers the conversation towards a more positive and supportive direction without taking sides or imposing a specific viewpoint.",
