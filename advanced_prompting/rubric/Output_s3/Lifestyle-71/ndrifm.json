    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation output is a judgement that acknowledges the complexity of the situation and the importance of having a plan for dealing with a potentially vindictive ex-partner. It does not take a clear side but instead emphasizes the validity of the discussion around the topic. The judgement is fair and neutral, recognizing the nuances in the conversation without asserting a definitive conclusion. However, it does not fully specify a correct side or provide clear supporting arguments for its position, which limits its effectiveness as a judgement. The message is somewhat vague and does not directly address the specific points of contention in the conversation.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the importance of safety and planning, which are central to the conversation. The message redirects the focus away from determining who is correct and instead encourages sharing strategies, which is relevant and has a high chance of guiding positive dialogue. The tone is natural and fits the context of the conversation, making it seem like a genuine user might say it. It avoids taking sides and promotes collaboration, which is appropriate for a steering message.",
