    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation output provides a judgement that acknowledges the complexity of the situation and prioritizes supporting the OP's experience of abuse over dismissing it. It correctly identifies the side that is more in line with empathy and moral responsibility, which is the perspective that does not question the OP's experience without evidence. However, the judgement is somewhat vague in its reasoning and does not provide specific arguments or evidence to back up its position. While it correctly identifies the more morally appropriate stance, the support for this position is not fully detailed, which slightly reduces its score. The judgement is neutral in the sense that it does not take a definitive stance on the truth of the abuse but rather on the appropriate response to the OP's experience.",
