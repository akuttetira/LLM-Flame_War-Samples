        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the person sharing their experience of abuse by a narcissistic mother and finding validation in a doctor's words is in the right. The judgement acknowledges the complexity of the situation, recognizing the validity of the person's experience and the importance of seeking professional help. It also addresses the dismissive comments from others, which can be harmful and invalidate the person's story. The judgement is supported by the context of the conversation, where the person's experience is portrayed as a deeply personal and validating one. The mediation does not take a neutral stance but clearly supports the person's perspective, which is appropriate given the context.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and aims to foster empathy and understanding. It acknowledges the personal and painful nature of the OP's experience and encourages a focus on support rather than debate. The message is relevant to the conversation, which revolves around validation, healing, and personal struggles. It is natural in context and could conceivably be written by a user. However, it is somewhat vague in its guidance and does not provide specific steps or directions for the conversation to move forward. It is neutral and does not take a side, which aligns with the supportive tone of the original conversation.",
