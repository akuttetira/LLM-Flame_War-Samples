    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a nuanced perspective that acknowledges the complexity of narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) and the potential for emotional abuse to stem from the abuser's own psychological struggles. It avoids a simplistic 'all narcissists are evil' dichotomy and instead suggests that empathy and understanding can be more effective strategies. However, the mediation does not clearly assert which side is correct in the original debate but instead offers a balanced view. The message is well-reasoned and aligns with psychological understanding of NPD, making it a fair and effective mediation. It is also natural in the context of the conversation and could conceivably be written by a user.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the diverse experiences shared in the conversation and emphasizes finding common ground and coping strategies. The message is relevant to the conversation and has a high chance of guiding positive dialogue. It is natural in context and could conceivably be written by a user. However, it does not provide specific guidance or actionable steps, which could be improved. Overall, it scores well on the steering metrics but could be slightly higher if it offered more concrete advice.",
