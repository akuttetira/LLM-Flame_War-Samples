    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the person sharing their personal experience (Koalacita67) is more in the right by acknowledging the validity of their feelings and the pressures they faced. The judgement recognizes that dismissing the OP\u2019s sentiment as immaturity is not fair, and instead emphasizes the importance of understanding individual experiences. The argument is supported by the content of the conversation, where Koalacita67 provides a personal and nuanced perspective that contrasts with the more dismissive comments. The mediation does not take an overly simplistic or biased stance, and it aligns with common principles of empathy and fairness.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the emotional aspect of high school nostalgia and encourages a more empathetic discussion. The message is directly relevant to the conversation, as it addresses the underlying theme of personal experiences and emotional impact. It is natural in context and could conceivably be written by a user aiming to foster positive dialogue. The message avoids taking sides and instead promotes understanding, which aligns with the goal of mediation.",
