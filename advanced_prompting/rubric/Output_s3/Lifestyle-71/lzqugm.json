        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the individuals who shared their personal experiences of abuse and responded with empathy and understanding are in the right. The judgment aligns with common morality and fairness principles by condemning the justification and dismissal of abuse. The mediation does not assign a neutral position but clearly supports the victims' perspectives. The supporting arguments are based on the emotional and psychological impact of abuse, which is a valid and fair basis for judgment. However, the mediation could have been more specific in explaining why the empathetic responses are more morally correct, but overall, it is a strong judgment.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the shared experience of processing trauma and emphasizes supporting each other rather than re-traumatizing. The message is directly relevant to the conversation, which involves individuals sharing personal experiences of abuse and coping mechanisms. It is natural in context and could conceivably be written by a user, as it avoids taking sides and focuses on fostering a supportive environment. The message effectively guides positive dialogue by encouraging empathy and understanding over blame.",
