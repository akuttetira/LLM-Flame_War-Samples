    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a judgement that the employee who reminded the colleague about the parents' relationship is more in the right. This aligns with the discussion where both parties acknowledge the complexity of the situation. The judgement is somewhat defensible, as it recognizes the employee's intent to support the adult child. However, it lacks a clear, comprehensive justification based on moral or fairness principles. The mediation does not fully address the appropriateness of giving opinions on someone else's family, which is a key point in the conversation. While it attempts to balance the perspectives, it does not fully resolve the issue or provide a neutral stance, which could be seen as biased.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The steering message is conciliatory and productive. It acknowledges the differing opinions and shifts the focus to the specific behaviors that led to the warning, which is directly relevant to the conversation. The message is natural in context and could conceivably be written by a user, encouraging a more constructive dialogue. It avoids taking sides and instead guides the conversation toward a more objective discussion of the situation.",
