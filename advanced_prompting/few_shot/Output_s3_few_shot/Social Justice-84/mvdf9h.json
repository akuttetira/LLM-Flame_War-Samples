        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the side citing credible sources like China itself and survivor testimonies is more in the right, as it acknowledges the existence of substantial evidence supporting the claim of genocide. However, it does not fully address the complexity of testimonial reliability or the potential for political bias, which are key aspects of the discussion. This fits a score of 4, as it provides a clear stance with reasonable support but could have been more nuanced in its analysis.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages focusing on facts and finding common ground, which is relevant to the heated discussion. It is somewhat generic and could sound like an AI-generated response, but it is still natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns with a score of 4.",
