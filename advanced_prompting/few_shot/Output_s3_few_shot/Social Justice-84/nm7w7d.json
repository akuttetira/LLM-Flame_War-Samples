    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that those advocating for reporting and taking action against hate speech are more in the right, as they are addressing the severity of the content and seeking to hold the community accountable. The argument is clear and aligns with common moral and ethical standards. However, the mediation does not provide detailed support for this conclusion, such as specific examples or further explanation of why taking action is more justified. This earns it a score of 4.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant to the discussion, focusing on the issue of hate speech and the difficulty of reporting it. It shifts the conversation towards constructive solutions rather than blame, which is appropriate for a steering message. However, it is somewhat generic and could come across as overly scripted or AI-generated. It has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue but is not as natural or tailored as a 5. This fits a score of 4.",
