    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that /LoveForAnimesexuals and /LoveForLandlords share similarities with /LaughingAtPalestine in promoting hate and intolerance, which aligns with the conversation's context. It provides a more nuanced and convincing argument than a simple dismissal, though it could have offered more specific examples or evidence to strengthen its case. This fits a score of 4, as it is accurate and persuasive but not definitively conclusive.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant, focusing on the more obvious hate sub /LoveForLandlords and its connections to /LaughingAtPalestine. It avoids getting bogged down in less relevant or obscure subreddits like /LoveForAnimesexuals. However, it is somewhat generic and could feel more like a generic moderation suggestion rather than a natural, context-specific guide. This aligns with a score of 3.",
