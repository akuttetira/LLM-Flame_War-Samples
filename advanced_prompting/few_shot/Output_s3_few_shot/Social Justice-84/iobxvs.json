        "rationale": "The mediation offers a nuanced judgment that acknowledges the complexity of the situation, suggesting that the purge may have been more than just a necessary step to maintain standards. However, it does not clearly determine which side is more in the right and lacks strong, concrete supporting arguments from the conversation. The reasoning is somewhat vague and does not fully engage with the evidence presented by both sides. This fits a score of 3.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant, encouraging a focus on content and behavior rather than making blanket accusations. It invites a constructive discussion about the reasons for bans and community improvement. While it is somewhat generic, it is still natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
