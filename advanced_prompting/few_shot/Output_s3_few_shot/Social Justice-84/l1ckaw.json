    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the situation by recognizing that the friend's experience with the sub may have been temporary but could have led to deeper issues. It avoids a simplistic judgment about the sub as a whole and instead focuses on the individual's potential struggles. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right in terms of the sub's role or the friend's actions. This fits a score of 3 as it offers some nuance but lacks a clear determination of right and wrong with strong supporting arguments.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages understanding rather than judgment, which aligns with the steering type. It acknowledges the complexity of the situation and invites the participants to focus on common concerns about hate and toxicity. While it is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like an AI, it is still reasonably natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
