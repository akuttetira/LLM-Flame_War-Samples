        "rationale": "The mediation offers a nuanced comparison between two perspectives on the mods' role in the sub. It acknowledges the possibility that the sub's content naturally attracts right-wingers, which is a reasonable view. However, it does not clearly determine which side is more in the right, nor does it provide strong, concrete arguments to support its position. This fits a score of 3, as it offers some nuance but lacks a clear verdict or strong backing.",

        "rationale": "The mediation focuses on the actual content and behavior of the mods, which is relevant and constructive. It shifts the discussion away from speculation and encourages a more factual approach. While it is somewhat generic, it is still effective in guiding the conversation toward a more productive direction. This aligns with a score of 4.",
