        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument against No New Normal and Female Dating Strategy as hate groups is more defensible than dismissing their content as harmless. It acknowledges the nuanced nature of the discussion but does not provide strong, specific arguments to support its position. The mediation is somewhat vague and lacks the depth needed for a strong 5, but it is not entirely wrong. This fits with a score of 4.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant, encouraging the group to focus on specific examples rather than generalizing about subreddits. It addresses the core concern of shutting down hate subreddits but is somewhat generic and could come off as AI-generated. It has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue, though it lacks the natural tone of a human conversation. This aligns with a score of 4.",
