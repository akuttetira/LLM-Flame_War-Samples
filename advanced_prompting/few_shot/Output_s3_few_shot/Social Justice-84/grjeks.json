    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation clearly identifies the wrongfulness of the argument that LGBTQ+ individuals should be persecuted or killed due to their identity, which is a strong and morally sound judgment. It directly addresses the core issue and rejects the harmful stance with clarity. This fits the highest score as it correctly ascertains which side is in the right based on common morality and fairness, and clearly backs up its position with strong arguments.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages respectful dialogue, which aligns with the steering type. It directly addresses the need for civility and understanding, which is relevant to the conversation. However, it is somewhat generic and could come off as too neutral or even AI-generated. It has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue but lacks the specific, actionable steps that would make it more effective. This fits with a score of 4.",
