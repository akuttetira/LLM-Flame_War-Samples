    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the individuals calling out Steve Huffman's past actions and advocating for better moderation are more in the right, as their concerns align with the evident issues of racism, harassment, and poor moderation on Reddit. The argument is backed by the discussion in the conversation, which highlights the real-world impact of these issues on users. However, the mediation could have provided more nuance by acknowledging the complexity of Reddit's moderation challenges and the difficulty of balancing free speech with safety. This fits a 4, as the position is correct with strong arguments, but could be more nuanced.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and directly relevant to the discussion, encouraging a focus on specific examples of problematic behavior and finding solutions. It avoids getting bogged down in the 'ironic' vs. 'sincere' debate, which is a key issue in the conversation. While it is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like an AI, it is still reasonably natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
