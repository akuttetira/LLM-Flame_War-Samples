    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that using humor to mask hate speech is a deliberate tactic to normalize bigotry, which aligns with the discussion in the conversation. It provides a clear, nuanced argument that highlights the harmful intent behind such humor, and it is backed by references to real-world examples and definitions. This fits the criteria for a 5, as it correctly ascertains the right side based on common morality and fairness and clearly backs up its position with strong arguments.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and directly relevant to the discussion about hate speech and the misuse of humor as a cover for offensive content. It clearly calls out the issue without being overly generic or AI-like. The message is natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue by shifting the focus to addressing hate speech rather than debating humor. This aligns well with a score of 5.",
