        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument about mods being unfairly targeted and admins not providing adequate support is more compelling than the claim that mods are simply defending a racist post. It acknowledges the complexity of the situation and the concerns raised about moderation and admin support. However, it does not fully address the ethical implications of the racist content itself or provide a clear, balanced judgment. This fits a score of 4 as it offers a nuanced perspective with reasonable support but could be more thorough in addressing the core issue.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and directly addresses the core issues of frustration and confusion in the conversation. It encourages focusing on specific problems like the mods' handling of the post and admin support, which are relevant to the discussion. While it is somewhat generic and could come off as overly polite, it is still effective in guiding the conversation toward a more constructive direction. This fits a score of 4.",
