        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument against racism, even when disguised as humor, is more compelling than the dismissal of racism as non-existent. It acknowledges the prevalence of racism and the importance of calling it out, which aligns with common moral and ethical standards. However, it does not provide strong, specific arguments or evidence to back up its position, which slightly reduces its score. This fits a 4, as it correctly identifies the more right position but could have been more thorough in its support.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant to the discussion, encouraging a focus on specific examples of problematic content rather than generalizing about hate speech. It also invites a constructive discussion about addressing root causes, which is a positive direction. However, the message feels somewhat generic and could be more tailored to the specific context of the subreddit and the content in question. This aligns with a score of 3.",
