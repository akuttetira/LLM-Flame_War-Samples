    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument about the subreddit being a cesspool of hate and violence, with admins knowing about it but doing nothing, is more defensible than the blanket claim that conservatives are the only ones responsible. It provides a nuanced perspective that acknowledges the complexity of the issue, though it could have been more specific in addressing the actual conversation. This fits a score of 4 as it offers a reasonable and balanced judgment with some supporting reasoning.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation offers a conciliatory and relevant approach by acknowledging the toxicity of the community while suggesting a more nuanced discussion about the intersection of user behavior, platform design, and societal factors. It encourages a constructive dialogue that moves beyond the current toxic dynamics. However, it is somewhat generic and could sound more like an AI-generated response rather than a natural, human-like steering message. This aligns with a score of 3.",
