        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the situation, distinguishing between the Capitol invasion and broader generalizations about Trump supporters. It provides a balanced perspective by recognizing that some individuals were trying to make their voices heard, which is a nuanced and fair assessment. However, it does not fully address the core issue of the violence and the justification for the ban, and the argument is somewhat weak in its support. This fits a score of 3.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages focusing on facts and respectful dialogue, which is relevant to the discussion. It avoids generalizations and promotes a constructive approach. While it is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like an AI, it is still reasonably natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
