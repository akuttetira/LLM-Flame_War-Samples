        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges a nuanced perspective by recognizing that while conservative parties have historically been exclusionary, there is a possibility of inclusion in the future. It provides a balanced view by not outright dismissing the idea of inclusion, which is more defensible than a blanket dismissal. However, it does not clearly argue for or against the inclusion of LGBT individuals in conservative parties with strong, concrete reasoning. This fits a score of 3, as it offers some nuance but lacks strong supporting arguments.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant, encouraging a focus on building coalitions and real inclusivity rather than assuming conservatism is immutable. It acknowledges the historical context of co-optation while suggesting a constructive path forward. However, it is somewhat generic and could come off as more AI-generated or parent-like compared to a more natural, conversational tone. This fits a score of 4 as it is effective in guiding positive dialogue but has minor issues with naturalness.",
