        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that using a racial slur as a substitute is a form of hate speech and should be condemned, which aligns with common moral and ethical standards. It also acknowledges the other side's attempts to deflect or mock the issue but does not fully engage with their arguments. The mediation is clear and directly addresses the core issue, but it lacks nuanced analysis of the broader context of online discourse and free speech. This fits a score of 4, as it is correct but could have been more balanced in its analysis.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and directly relevant to the discussion, focusing on the core issue of hate speech. It encourages agreement on the problem at hand while leaving room for disagreement on solutions. The message is natural and likely to guide positive dialogue, though it is slightly generic compared to a 5. This fits well with a score of 4.",
