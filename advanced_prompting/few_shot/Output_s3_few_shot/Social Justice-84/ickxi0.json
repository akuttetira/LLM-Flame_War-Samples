        "rationale": "The mediation correctly acknowledges the complexity of the situation, recognizing that not all users of the subreddit are complicit in hate and that tolerance is not always appropriate. It provides a nuanced perspective that avoids a blanket condemnation of all PCM users, which is a positive approach. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right and lacks specific, concrete arguments to support its position. This fits with a score of 3, as it offers some nuance but does not fully establish a clear moral or factual stance.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant to the conversation, as it suggests focusing on specific examples rather than generalizing about groups. This approach could help guide the discussion towards more constructive dialogue by encouraging concrete examples and reducing broad accusations. However, it is somewhat generic and could come off as overly simplistic or not deeply tailored to the context. This fits a score of 4 as it is relevant and has a good chance of improving dialogue, though not as natural or specific as a 5.",
