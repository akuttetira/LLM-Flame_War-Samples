        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the discussion does not support the 'shoot to kill' doctrine as more justifiable, instead highlighting the debate around its use and potential for abuse. It accurately reflects the nuanced arguments presented in the conversation, acknowledging the complexity of the issue without taking a clear side. This fits well with a score of 4, as it provides a balanced assessment based on the conversation's content.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant, encouraging the group to focus on specific examples rather than abstract philosophical debates. It offers a constructive direction by suggesting tangible cases where the 'shoot to kill' doctrine has been problematic. While it is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like an AI, it is still reasonably natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
