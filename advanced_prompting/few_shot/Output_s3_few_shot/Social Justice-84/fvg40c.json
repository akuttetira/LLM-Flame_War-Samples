        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the situation, recognizing that while the Chinese government's handling of the pandemic had issues, the argument that they handled it better than other countries is more defensible than the blanket accusations of racism and xenophobia. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right and lacks strong, concrete arguments to support its position. This fits with a score of 3, as it offers some nuance but does not decisively determine who is more in the right or provide strong backing for its stance.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and directly relevant to the conversation, focusing on the factual issues of the Chinese government's actions. It encourages a nuanced discussion by emphasizing the importance of facts and avoiding harmful language. While it is somewhat generic, it is still natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
