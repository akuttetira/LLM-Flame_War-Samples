    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies the diversity within the Libertarian movement and challenges the oversimplified, derogatory characterization of all Libertarians as fascists or bigots. It provides a more balanced and defensible perspective, acknowledging the complexity of political beliefs. However, it does not fully engage with the specific arguments made in the conversation or provide strong, concrete support for its position. This places it at a mid-level score where the argument is generally correct but could be more robust.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages a more specific and constructive discussion about the Libertarian community. It avoids generalizations and invites the participants to focus on specific issues or topics, which is relevant to the conversation. While it is somewhat generic, it is still natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
