        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the defense of the admin's hiring and the backlash against her are more in line with the principles of fair judgment and accountability, rather than attacking her based on personal associations. It acknowledges the complexity of the situation and the importance of not jumping to conclusions based on limited information. However, it does not fully address the ethical concerns around the admin's past actions or the broader implications of the hiring decision. This fits a score of 4, as it provides a nuanced perspective with reasonable support.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages a more nuanced discussion, which is relevant to the ongoing conversation. It acknowledges the emotional weight of the situation while pushing for a constructive dialogue. However, it is somewhat generic and could come off as overly formal or distant, which may reduce its effectiveness in guiding the conversation. This fits with a score of 3.",
