        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument for MassTagger as a better tool for tracking hate speech is more compelling than the blanket claim that all hate subreddits are equally problematic. It acknowledges the strengths of MassTagger while critiquing the overgeneralization in the discussion. This shows a balanced and nuanced understanding of the debate, which fits well with a score of 4.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages learning from different experiences to improve inclusivity and respect. It is relevant to the discussion about hate subreddits and invites constructive dialogue. However, it is somewhat generic and lacks specific, actionable steps. This aligns with a score of 3, as it is conciliatory but not highly specific or natural in context.",
