        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the validity of the criticism against /r/AskTrumpSupporters while also addressing the concerns about r/askthedonald. It provides a balanced perspective that recognizes the flaws in both subreddits but does not fully endorse either. However, it does not clearly determine which subreddit is more in the right or provide strong, concrete arguments to support its position. This fits a score of 3, as it offers some nuance but lacks a clear verdict or strong backing.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and directly relevant to the discussion about the Q&A format and its effectiveness. It encourages a constructive dialogue about potential solutions, which aligns with the goal of improving the sub. While it is somewhat generic, it is still natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This fits well with a score of 4.",
