        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that Kelekona's perspective, which emphasizes engagement with hate groups to counter their influence, is more nuanced and effective than NuclearOops' call for ostracization. It acknowledges the complexity of addressing hate speech and the limitations of both approaches. However, it does not fully explain why Kelekona's approach is more effective or provide concrete arguments supporting this view. This fits with a score of 3, as it correctly identifies the more nuanced approach but lacks sufficient depth in supporting arguments.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant to the discussion about handling hate groups, encouraging a balance between confrontation and support. It acknowledges the complexity of the issue and invites collaborative learning from different perspectives. However, it is somewhat generic and lacks specific, actionable steps to guide the conversation in a more constructive direction. This fits with a score of 3, as it is conciliatory but not highly tailored to the specific context or offering clear guidance.",
