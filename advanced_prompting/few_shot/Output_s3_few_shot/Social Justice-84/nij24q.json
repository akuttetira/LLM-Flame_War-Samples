        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance the concerns about transphobia and hate speech with the importance of free speech, which shows some nuance. However, it does not clearly determine which side is more in the right and lacks specific, concrete arguments to support its position. The statement is somewhat vague and does not directly address the core issue of whether the subreddit's content is harmful or not. This fits a score of 3 as it offers some nuance but lacks clarity and strong support.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant, encouraging the group to focus on the actual hate speech and misinformation rather than getting entangled in arguments about who is right or wrong. It suggests a constructive action (reporting sub posts and mods) that aligns with the community's goal of safety and respect. While it is somewhat generic, it is still natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
