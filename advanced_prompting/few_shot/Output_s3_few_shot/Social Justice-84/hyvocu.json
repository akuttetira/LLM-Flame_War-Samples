    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument about radicalization and hate speech is more compelling than the view that the situation is a natural consequence of user behavior. It acknowledges the potential for harmful content to spread within subreddits and the role of moderators in addressing it. However, it does not fully elaborate on the reasoning or provide concrete evidence from the conversation to support this conclusion. This fits a 4, as it correctly identifies the stronger argument but could be more thorough in its justification.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant to the discussion about moderation and harmful content. It shifts the focus to creating a safe space and promoting respectful dialogue, which aligns with the goal of constructive conversation. However, it is somewhat generic and could sound more like a generic mediation than a natural, context-specific response. This fits a score of 4 as it is on the higher end of the steering scale but not quite a 5.",
