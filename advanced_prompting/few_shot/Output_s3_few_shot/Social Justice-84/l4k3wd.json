    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to acknowledge the validity of internalized homophobia and transphobia as concerns, which is a more nuanced and fair approach. However, it fails to clearly determine which side is more in the right and does not provide strong, concrete arguments to support its position. The statement is somewhat vague and does not fully address the complexity of the issue, which fits a mid-level score where there is some nuance but no clear verdict or strong backing.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The message is conciliatory and encourages focusing on specific hurtful behaviors rather than making assumptions about individuals' motivations. It is relevant to the discussion and invites a more constructive approach to addressing the issue. While it is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like an AI, it is still reasonably natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
