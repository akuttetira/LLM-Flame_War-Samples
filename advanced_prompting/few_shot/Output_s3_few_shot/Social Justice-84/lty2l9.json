        "rationale": "The judgement acknowledges the importance of the subreddit's rules in addressing hate speech and contrasts them with the inflammatory comments. It provides a reasonable assessment of the situation, recognizing the need for guidelines to maintain a respectful discourse. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right in terms of the debate between the subreddit's rules and the users' comments, nor does it provide strong, specific arguments to support its position. This fits a score of 3, as it offers some nuance but lacks a clear verdict or strong backing.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and directly addresses the core issue of pandemic misinformation, which is relevant to the conversation. It encourages a constructive discussion about specific examples of false information and how to correct them, avoiding personal attacks. While it is somewhat generic, it is still natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
