        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument about selective enforcement is stronger than the free speech argument, which shows a clear judgment about which side is more in the right. However, it lacks detailed support from the conversation, such as specific examples of selective enforcement or clear reasoning why the platform's actions indicate bias. This fits a 4, as it correctly identifies the right side but could have provided stronger backing.",

        "rationale": "The message is conciliatory and encourages a nuanced discussion, which is relevant to the conversation about Reddit's handling of The_Donald's subreddit. It addresses the potential for personal attacks and strawman arguments, which are present in the conversation. However, it is somewhat generic and could sound like an AI-generated response. It has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue but is not as natural or specific as a 5. This aligns with a score of 4.",
