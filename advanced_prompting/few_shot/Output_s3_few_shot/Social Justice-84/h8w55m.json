        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the situation and the need for evidence, which is a positive step. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right, nor does it provide strong arguments to support a particular position. Instead, it offers a vague and somewhat generic assessment of the discussion. This fits with a score of 3, as it shows some understanding but lacks clear determination or strong supporting arguments.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages a focus on facts and the investigation, which is relevant to the ongoing discussion. It avoids jumping to conclusions and promotes sharing credible information, which is constructive. However, it is somewhat generic and could come across as overly structured or formulaic. It still has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue and is reasonably natural in context. This aligns with a score of 4.",
