    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the discussion around collective guilt and distinguishes between criticizing Israel's policies and holding all Jews collectively responsible. It correctly identifies that the conversation is more nuanced than simple accusations of anti-Semitism. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right or provide strong arguments to support its position, which is a key requirement for a high score in the judgement category. This fits with a score of 3.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant to the conversation, as it addresses the issue of collective guilt and inflammatory language. It encourages a more constructive dialogue by focusing on specific issues and avoiding generalizations. However, it is somewhat generic and could sound more natural if it had more specific references to the conversation. This aligns with a score of 4.",
