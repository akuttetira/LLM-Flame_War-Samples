        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the concern about the Insurrection Act being used to escalate violence is more compelling than the claim that Trump would use it to suppress his own supporters. It acknowledges the potential for catastrophic escalation and the risks of using military force against civilians, which aligns with common morality and fairness. However, it does not fully address the complexity of the situation or provide a balanced view of both sides. This fits a 4 because it correctly identifies the more compelling argument but could have been more nuanced in its analysis.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant, encouraging the participants to focus on the present and the potential consequences of using military force. It addresses the concerns about history repeating itself but shifts the focus to the inherent problems of such a move. While it is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like an AI, it is still reasonably natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
