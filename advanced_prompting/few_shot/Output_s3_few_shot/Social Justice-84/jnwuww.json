        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the debate around whether the post is a bad attempt at humor or genuine racism, which shows some nuance. However, it does not clearly determine which side is more in the right, nor does it provide strong arguments to support its position. The statement is somewhat balanced but lacks the clarity and conviction needed for a 5. This fits better with a score of 3, as it offers a partially supported take without clearly establishing which side is more justified.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant to the discussion about hate speech and intent vs. impact. It encourages a constructive focus on addressing the issue rather than getting stuck in nuanced debates. While it is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like an AI, it is still reasonably natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
