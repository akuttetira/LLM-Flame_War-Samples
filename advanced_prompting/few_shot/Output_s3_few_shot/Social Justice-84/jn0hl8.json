    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the nuance in the argument by distinguishing between different subreddits and their purposes. It correctly identifies that not all conspiracy-related content is inherently bad, which aligns with the conversation where users discuss the difference between /r/conspiracy and /r/actualconspiracies. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right or provide strong arguments to support its position. This fits a score of 3, as it offers a partially supported take rather than a clear verdict.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The message is conciliatory and acknowledges the complexity of the discussion around conspiracy theories. It invites reflection and learning from different perspectives, which is relevant to the conversation. However, it is somewhat generic and lacks specific, actionable guidance that would directly help the participants move toward a more constructive dialogue. This fits a score of 3, as it is conciliatory but not sufficiently tailored to the specific context or issues at hand.",
