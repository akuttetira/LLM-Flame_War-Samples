    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges a nuanced perspective by recognizing that preserving hate speech as evidence can have some merit, which is a more balanced approach than a blanket claim to erase all hate speech. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right, nor does it provide strong arguments supporting this nuanced view. This fits with a score of 3, as there is some nuance but no clear verdict or strong backing.",

        "rationale": "The message is conciliatory and encourages participants to consider different perspectives, which is appropriate for the discussion around free speech and moderation. It is relevant to the conversation and invites a constructive dialogue about finding a middle ground. However, it is somewhat generic and lacks specific guidance on how to achieve this balance, which slightly reduces its effectiveness. This aligns with a score of 4.",
