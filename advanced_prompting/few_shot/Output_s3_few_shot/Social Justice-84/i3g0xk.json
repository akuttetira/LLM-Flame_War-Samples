    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to assess which side is more in the right by suggesting that those defending Trainmanthe3rd and mocking the original poster are more justified. However, it does not provide clear, neutral reasoning or evidence from the conversation to support this claim. The assessment is somewhat subjective and lacks the objective analysis required for a strong judgement. This fits a lower mid-level score due to the lack of concrete support and neutrality.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory, directly relevant, and effectively guides the conversation back to the main topic. It clearly states the desired focus and encourages civil dialogue, which is appropriate for the context. The message feels natural and would plausibly be written by a user seeking to improve the conversation. This aligns with a score of 5.",
