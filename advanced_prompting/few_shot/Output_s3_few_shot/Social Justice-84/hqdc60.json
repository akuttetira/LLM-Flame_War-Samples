    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the issue by recognizing that transphobia is a legitimate concern within the LGBT community, while also addressing the harm caused by TERFs. It provides a balanced view that is not overly simplistic or dismissive, and it aligns with the nuanced discussion present in the conversation. However, it could be more specific in its arguments and could benefit from clearer references to the conversation's content. This fits a score of 4.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages understanding rather than labeling, which is relevant to the discussion. It invites participants to focus on mutual understanding, which could guide positive dialogue. However, it is somewhat generic and could sound less natural in context. This fits with a score of 4, as it is relevant and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue, though not as natural as a 5.",
