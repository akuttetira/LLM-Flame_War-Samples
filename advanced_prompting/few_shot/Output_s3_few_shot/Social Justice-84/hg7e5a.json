        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the situation, recognizing that the creation of ActualPublicFreakouts was a response to perceived censorship and that the issue of moderation and racism is multifaceted. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right or provide strong arguments to support its position. The statement is somewhat vague and does not fully address the nuances of the debate, which fits a mid-level score.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages focusing on facts and rules rather than personal attacks, which is relevant to the discussion about moderation and subreddits. However, it is somewhat generic and lacks specific guidance on how to achieve a safe space. It could sound a bit like an AI-generated response and doesn't directly address the complex issues of moderation and bias in the subreddits. This fits with a score of 3.",
