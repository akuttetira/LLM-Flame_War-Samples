    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to address the debate by suggesting that anti-hate rhetoric can be problematic, but it does so in a way that is not clearly grounded in the conversation's content. It does not directly engage with the specific claims made by the users about Jewish influence or the nature of hate. The statement is somewhat vague and does not clearly determine which side is more in the right, making it a mid-level judgment. This fits a score of 3.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and directly addresses the issue of the conversation devolving into personal attacks. It clearly suggests a shift in focus to the original topic and its implications, which is relevant and likely to guide positive dialogue. While it is somewhat generic, it is still natural and has a good chance of improving the conversation. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
