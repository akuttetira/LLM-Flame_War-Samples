    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation incorrectly frames the issue by prioritizing the claim about hate groups distributing child exploitation material over the claim that some users are hateful or dishonest. This is misleading because the original discussion centers on the false accusation of child exploitation material being posted by AHS users, which is a serious and harmful claim. The mediation fails to address the core issue of false accusations and instead shifts focus to a different, more complex and potentially misleading narrative. This undermines the original context and risks reinforcing the very conspiracy theories it aims to counter. The score is lower due to this misalignment.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively shifts the focus to the real issue of hate groups spreading child exploitation material, which is a clear and specific concern. It directly addresses the harmful behavior being discussed and encourages a constructive approach by focusing on the actual harm rather than speculation. The message is clear, relevant, and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. However, it is somewhat generic and could benefit from more specific examples or actionable steps. This aligns with a score of 4.",
