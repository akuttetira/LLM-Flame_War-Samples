    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument against minors transitioning without parental consent is more problematic, as it ignores the complexities of informed consent and potential paternalistic control. It provides a nuanced comparison between the two positions, acknowledging the risks and benefits of both approaches. However, it does not fully address the emotional and psychological impact on trans youth or provide concrete arguments for why the paternalistic approach is more flawed. This fits a score of 4, as it offers a reasonable and nuanced judgment with some supporting arguments.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant, encouraging a respectful discussion on the complexities of the issue. It suggests specific areas for constructive dialogue, such as the risks and benefits of puberty blockers and the role of parental involvement. However, it is somewhat generic and could come across as overly structured or formulaic. It has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue but lacks the natural tone and specificity that would make it more effective. This aligns with a score of 3.",
