    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the discussion about in-groups and out-groups is more nuanced and accurate than the simplistic claims of racism and victimhood. It acknowledges the complexity of right-wing ideologies and the role of economic structures in maintaining inequality. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right or provide strong, specific arguments to support its position. This fits a score of 3, as it shows some nuance but lacks a clear verdict or robust backing.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages participants to learn from each other's perspectives, which is relevant to the discussion on power dynamics and social divisions. However, it is somewhat generic and lacks specific guidance on how to find common ground. It could feel a bit like a generic AI response rather than a natural, human-like mediation. This fits with a score of 3, as it is conciliatory but lacks the specificity and naturalness needed for a higher score.",
