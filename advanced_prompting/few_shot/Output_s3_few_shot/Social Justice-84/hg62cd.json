    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that body shaming is a personal attack and provides a stronger argument against it compared to the claim that making fun of appearance is harmless. It offers a clear, morally grounded judgment that aligns with common principles of respect and fairness. This fits the criteria for a 5.",
        "score": 5
    },
    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant to the conversation, as it encourages focusing on the content rather than the tone. It invites constructive dialogue by asking about the point of the post and how to discuss it. While it is slightly generic, it is still natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns with a score of 4.",
