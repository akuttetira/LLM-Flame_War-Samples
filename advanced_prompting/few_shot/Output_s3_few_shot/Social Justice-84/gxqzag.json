        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the issue by distinguishing between simplistic views of rioting and a more nuanced explanation of misinformation spread due to perceived norms. However, it does not clearly determine which side is more in the right, nor does it provide strong arguments to support its position. This fits a score of 3, as it offers some nuance but lacks a clear judgment or strong backing.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and directly relevant to the conversation, as it addresses the issue of misinformation and encourages a focus on facts and impact rather than speculation. It is well-worded and natural in context, though it could be slightly more specific in suggesting actionable steps. This aligns with a score of 4.",
