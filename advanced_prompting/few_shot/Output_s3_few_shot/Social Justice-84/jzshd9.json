    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to distinguish between a critique of reporting on Trump's defeat and hate speech, which shows some understanding of the context. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right and lacks strong, concrete arguments drawn from the conversation. The reasoning is somewhat vague and does not fully engage with the nuances of the debate, which fits a mid-level score.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation directly addresses the core issue of whether reporting on Trump's loss constitutes hate speech, which is relevant to the conversation. It encourages a focused discussion on the context and implications rather than personal attacks, which is constructive. However, the message is somewhat generic and could come off as overly prescriptive or AI-generated. It is still reasonably natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue, which aligns with a score of 4.",
