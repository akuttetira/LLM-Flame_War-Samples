        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument about Christianity's history of violence and supremacy is more nuanced and accurate than the blanket claim against Jews. It acknowledges the complexity of historical and religious contexts without oversimplifying or making unsupported generalizations. This aligns with a high score as it provides a balanced and informed assessment.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation encourages a more nuanced discussion by suggesting a focus on specific examples and historical context, which is relevant and constructive. It also addresses the issue of oversimplification and stereotyping, which is important in this conversation. While the message is somewhat generic and could be seen as overly neutral, it is still effective in guiding the conversation towards a more balanced and informed discussion. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
