        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the person who recognizes the manipulative tactics of a narcissistic personality and is willing to set boundaries is more in the right. This is supported by the conversation where the individual clearly outlines the abusive behavior and the consequences of not setting boundaries. The mediation also acknowledges the complexity of the situation but clearly supports the side that is taking a proactive and healthy approach. This fits well with a score of 5 as it correctly ascertains which side is in the right based on common morality and fairness, and clearly backs up its position with strong arguments.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages focusing on supporting the OP rather than getting caught up in debates. It is relevant to the conversation and invites a constructive direction. While it is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like an AI, it is still reasonably natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
