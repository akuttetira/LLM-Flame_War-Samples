    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the person advocating for friends to respect the OP's boundary is in the right, as it aligns with the principle of respecting personal boundaries and avoiding harm. This is supported by the conversation where the OP clearly explains their sensitivity to the term 'father' versus 'dad' and the frustration with friends not respecting that boundary. The mediation is clear, fair, and directly addresses the issue at hand, making it a strong 5.",
        "score": 5
    },
    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and acknowledges the OP's effort to explain their feelings and boundaries. It encourages mutual understanding and respect for differences in communication styles, which is relevant to the discussion. However, it is somewhat generic and lacks specific guidance on how to move forward constructively. It feels a bit like a generic AI response rather than a natural, human-centered message. This aligns with a score of 3.",
