        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the discussion focuses on the complexity of parental behavior, acknowledging that parents may act out of limited resources and inherited trauma. It provides a nuanced, compassionate take that is more realistic than a simplistic judgment. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right, nor does it provide strong, concrete arguments to back up its position. This fits a score of 3, as it offers some nuance but lacks a clear verdict or strong support.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages mutual learning and support, which aligns well with the shared theme of personal growth and self-discovery in the conversation. It is relevant to the discussion and invites constructive dialogue. While it is somewhat generic, it still feels natural and has a good chance of guiding positive interaction. This fits a score of 4.",
