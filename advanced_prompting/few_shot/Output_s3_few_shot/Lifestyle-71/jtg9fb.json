    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the situation described involves potential domestic violence and that the person who called the police is in the right for seeking help. The person defending their actions is also in the right for supporting the OP's decision. However, the mediation does not fully address the complexity of the situation or provide nuanced arguments. It is clear and correct but lacks depth in reasoning, which slightly lowers the score.",

    },
    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and directly relevant to the conversation, encouraging a constructive focus on supporting the OP and discussing strategies for future situations. It avoids taking sides and promotes a positive, solution-oriented approach. While it is somewhat generic, it is still natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
