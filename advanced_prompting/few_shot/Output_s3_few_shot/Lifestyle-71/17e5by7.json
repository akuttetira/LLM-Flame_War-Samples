        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the person who criticizes the husband's behavior as excessive and calls for accountability is more in the right. It addresses the core issue of responsibility and emotional regulation, which is central to the conflict. However, it could have been more neutral in its tone and provided a more balanced perspective. This fits a score of 4 as it correctly identifies the more just position but could have been more neutral.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant to the conversation, as it shifts the focus from blaming individuals to addressing the husband's behavior and offering practical strategies for managing anger. It is somewhat generic but still natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This fits a score of 4.",
