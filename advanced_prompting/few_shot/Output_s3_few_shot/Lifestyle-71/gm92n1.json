    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the person advocating for leaving a toxic relationship and prioritizing one's own well-being is in the right, aligning with common moral and ethical standards. It clearly supports this position and addresses the issue of abuse and the obligation of the abuser to take responsibility. This fits the criteria for a 5, as it accurately determines who is in the right and provides strong, clear support for the position.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant to the discussion about toxic relationships and the desire for peace. It addresses the issue of conflation between victim's needs and abuser's control, and invites a constructive discussion on recognizing and supporting people leaving toxic relationships. However, it is somewhat generic and could feel more like a generic advice rather than a natural response to the specific context. This aligns with a score of 3.",
