    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation incorrectly identifies the person advocating for a context of abuse as being 'more in the right' while dismissing the original poster's personal experience. This fails to acknowledge the complexity of the situation and the potential harm of perpetuating a narrative of abuse without understanding the context. The argument is not well-supported by the conversation and is overly judgmental, which is why it receives a low score.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages civil dialogue, which is relevant to the context of the conversation. It addresses the potential for harm and emphasizes mutual support, which aligns with the subculture's norms. However, it is somewhat generic and lacks specific guidance on how to navigate the particular dynamics of the sub. This fits a score of 3 as it is conciliatory but not highly tailored to the conversation's nuances.",
