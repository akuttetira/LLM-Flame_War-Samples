        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the discussion is more nuanced, acknowledging the difference between healthy self-criticism and the harmful inner critic. It accurately reflects the conversation's complexity and provides a balanced perspective without taking sides. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right or provide strong, concrete arguments to back its position. This fits with a score of 3, as it shows some nuance but lacks a clear verdict or strong support.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant to the discussion about victim-blaming and self-criticism. It encourages the group to focus on creating a safe space for discussion, which is a constructive and positive direction. The message is naturally phrased and fits well within the context of a support group. However, it is somewhat generic and could be more specific in suggesting actionable steps. This aligns with a score of 4.",
