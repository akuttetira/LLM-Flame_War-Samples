    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the side advocating for personal success and happiness, despite past trauma, is more in the right. It acknowledges the validity of the emotional struggle but emphasizes the positive path of self-actualization over revenge. However, it could have provided more specific arguments or context from the conversation to fully support this stance, which slightly reduces its score. This fits with a 4, as it is correct but could be more nuanced.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages the participants to focus on mutual support rather than competing with each other. It is relevant to the conversation about overcoming parental issues and personal success, and it invites a constructive, positive direction. However, it is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like an AI-generated response. It still has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue, which aligns with a score of 4.",
