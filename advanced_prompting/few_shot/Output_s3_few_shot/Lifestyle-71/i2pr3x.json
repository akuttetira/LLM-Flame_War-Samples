        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges a nuanced perspective on narcissistic abuse, recognizing that it can stem from the abuser's own emotional issues rather than labeling all narcissists as inherently evil. This shows a balanced approach, but it does not clearly determine which side is more in the right or provide strong, specific arguments. The statement is somewhat vague and could be seen as generic, which fits a mid-level score.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages participants to focus on shared experiences and healing rather than conflict. It is relevant to the discussion about coping with narcissistic parents and invites a constructive dialogue. However, it is somewhat generic and lacks specific, actionable steps that could guide the conversation more effectively. This aligns with a score of 3.",
