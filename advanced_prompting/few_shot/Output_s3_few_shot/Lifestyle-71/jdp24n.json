        "rationale": "The judgement correctly identifies the more nuanced approach to processing childhood trauma as more in line with compassionate and healing values, which aligns with common moral and psychological principles. However, it does not provide strong, concrete arguments or clear support for this position, and the phrasing feels somewhat vague. This fits a score of 3, as it correctly identifies the right side but lacks strong backing.",

        "rationale": "The mediation offers a balanced approach by acknowledging the pain of past traumas while encouraging seeking help, which is both conciliatory and relevant to the discussion. It avoids taking sides and instead focuses on supporting the participants' well-being. However, it is somewhat generic and could be more specific in addressing the context of abuse and the need for professional help. This fits a score of 3 as it is conciliatory but lacks the specificity and natural tone that would elevate it to a 4 or 5.",
