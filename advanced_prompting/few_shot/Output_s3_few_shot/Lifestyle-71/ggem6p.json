        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the group advocating for the brother's protection and acknowledging the abuse's long-term effects is more in the right. It provides a clear stance and aligns with the conversation's context, though it could have been more specific about the arguments supporting this position. The score reflects a balanced assessment of the situation with a clear judgment.",

        "rationale": "The message is conciliatory and encourages the participant to seek help from trusted adults, which is relevant to the conversation about abuse and safety. It is reasonably natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. However, it is somewhat generic and could be more specific in suggesting actionable steps. This fits well with a score of 4.",
