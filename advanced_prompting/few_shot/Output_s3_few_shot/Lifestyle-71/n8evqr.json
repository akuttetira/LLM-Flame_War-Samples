    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the person defending Jameela Jamil is more in the right, as they are countering ableist accusations and acknowledging the photographic evidence of her EDS symptoms. The opposing side makes unfounded claims without proper evidence. This is a clear and fair determination based on the conversation, supported by specific arguments. This warrants a score of 5.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and directly relevant to the discussion, as it encourages focusing on supporting Jameela Jamil and others with similar experiences while avoiding derailing the thread. It clearly addresses the issue of media portrayal and aligns with the community guidelines. The message is natural and likely to guide positive dialogue, though it could be slightly more specific in its suggestions. This fits well with a score of 4.",
