        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the person sharing their personal struggles and seeking support is more in the right, as their experience reflects genuine mental health struggles and the need for support. However, the mediation does not provide strong or clear arguments to back up this position, and it fails to address the complexity of the situation, such as the role of toxic relationships and the validity of the other participants' concerns. This fits with a score of 3, as it correctly identifies the more right side but lacks strong supporting arguments.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and offers genuine support by acknowledging the pain and providing resources for help. It avoids judgment and encourages reaching out to trusted adults, therapists, or hotlines, which is relevant to the discussion about mental health and support. The message is natural and likely to guide positive dialogue, though it could be slightly more specific about available resources. This fits well with a score of 4.",
