    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the person defending the OP's decision to set boundaries with their mother, while also acknowledging the potential for abuse, is more in the right. This reflects a nuanced understanding of the situation, recognizing both the importance of personal autonomy and the serious nature of potential abuse. The argument is supported by the context of the conversation and the concern for the OP's well-being. This aligns with a score of 5.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and directly relevant to the conversation, focusing on supporting OP and their decision to set boundaries. It avoids getting bogged down in debates about what is 'normal' or 'acceptable' and instead shifts the focus to mutual respect and support. While it is somewhat generic, it is still natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
