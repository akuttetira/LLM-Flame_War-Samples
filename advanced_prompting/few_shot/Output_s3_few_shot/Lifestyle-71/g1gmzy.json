        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the individuals sharing their experiences of being raised by narcissistic parents and their efforts to heal are more in the right. It acknowledges the validity of their struggles and the importance of healing, which aligns with common morality and fairness. However, it does not clearly state which side is in the right and lacks specific arguments to support its position. This fits with a score of 3, as it offers a partially supported take rather than a clear, well-argued judgment.",

        "rationale": "The message is conciliatory and encourages the participants to focus on mutual support and healing, which is relevant to the ongoing discussion about childhood trauma and parental influence. However, it is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like an AI-generated response. It does not offer specific, actionable steps for support but rather a general invitation to continue the conversation. This aligns with a score of 3, as it is conciliatory but lacks the specificity and naturalness of a higher score.",
