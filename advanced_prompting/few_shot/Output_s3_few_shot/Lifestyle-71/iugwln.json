    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the person sharing their personal experience of domestic abuse is more in the right, as their account is a firsthand account of a traumatic situation. However, it does not provide strong or nuanced arguments to support this position, and it lacks a comprehensive analysis of the broader context of abuse and its impact. This fits with a score of 3, as it correctly identifies the more right side but provides weak or incomplete supporting arguments.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and acknowledges the bravery of sharing personal struggles. It encourages focusing on support rather than debate, which is relevant to the conversation. However, it is somewhat generic and lacks specific, actionable steps to guide positive dialogue. It does not fully align with the context of the discussion about abuse and narcissism, making it slightly less effective than a 5. This fits a score of 3.",
