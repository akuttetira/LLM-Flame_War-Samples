    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the person sharing their personal experience of overcoming emotional manipulation and controlling behavior from their parents is in the right, based on the detailed and empathetic account provided. It also appropriately counters the dismissive comments from others who downplay the difficulty of leaving controlling parents. The argument is supported by the concrete examples and emotional weight of the shared experience, making this a strong and fair judgement. This aligns with a score of 5.",

It highlights the value of different perspectives and promotes a constructive dialogue. While it is somewhat generic and could be more specific in its guidance, it still effectively steers the conversation toward a more positive and supportive direction. This aligns with a score of 4.",
