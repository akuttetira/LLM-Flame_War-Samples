    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the discussion revolves around the moral implications of a historical text and the interpretation of religious texts. The mediator acknowledges that the person pointing out contradictions and problematic aspects of Judaism's relationship with the Torah is more aligned with a nuanced and critical perspective, which is more in line with a fair and thoughtful analysis of the text's implications. This is a more constructive and fair assessment of the discussion.",
        "score": 4
    },
    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation encourages a more constructive dialogue by focusing on understanding perspectives and exploring specific teachings. It invites participants to discuss problematic passages and their relevance to modern practice, which is a fair and neutral approach. It avoids taking sides and instead promotes a collaborative exploration of the topic, which is appropriate for a steering role.",
