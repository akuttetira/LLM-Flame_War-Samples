        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the burden of proof lies with the claimant, which is a sound argument in the context of the discussion about religious claims. It also acknowledges the flaw in blanket dismissals of theism as unprovable, which shows nuance. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right, nor does it provide strong, concrete arguments to support its position. This fits with a score of 3, as it offers a partially supported take rather than a clear determination of right and wrong.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant, encouraging the participants to focus on specific claims rather than general principles. It is well-worded and directly addresses the ongoing discussion about proof and evidence. While it is slightly generic and could be more tailored to the specific arguments in the conversation, it still has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
