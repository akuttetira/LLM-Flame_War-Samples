    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges that the argument about religions following man-made patterns is more convincing than the dismissal of it as a misunderstanding. It provides a balanced perspective by recognizing the validity of the argument while also addressing the counterpoints. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right or provide strong, concrete arguments to support its position. This fits with a score of 3, as it offers some nuance but lacks a clear verdict or strong backing.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages mutual learning and curiosity, which is relevant to the discussion about religion and divine communication. However, it is quite generic and does not directly address the specific arguments or points made in the conversation. It feels a bit like a generic AI response rather than a natural, human-like steering message. This aligns with a score of 3.",
