    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to evaluate the arguments on both sides but fails to clearly determine which side is more in the right. It suggests that the religious tradition argument is more defensible, but this is not convincingly supported by the conversation. The mediation lacks strong, specific arguments to back up its position and does not adequately address the substantial evidence presented on both sides regarding health, trauma, and cultural practices. This fits a lower score due to insufficient support and clarity.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation encourages a focus on factual and scientific discussion while avoiding personal attacks and cultural assumptions, which aligns well with the conversation's nature. It is relevant and directly addresses the debate around circumcision's health benefits and cultural practices. The message is conciliatory and invites constructive dialogue, though it is somewhat generic and could be more specific in its guidance. This fits a score of 4.",
