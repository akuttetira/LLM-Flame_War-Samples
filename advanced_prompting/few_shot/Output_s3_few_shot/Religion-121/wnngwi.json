        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the person questioning the morality of child marriage and the Prophet's actions is more in the right, as the arguments against child marriage are grounded in universal moral principles and human rights. The opposing side's defense of cultural relativism is less compelling in the context of a moral debate. The mediation clearly states which side is more in the right and provides a rationale based on common morality and fairness. This fits the criteria for a 5.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages the participants to focus on specific issues like the age of Aisha and child marriage, which are central to the discussion. It addresses the problematic nature of the conversation by suggesting a more constructive approach, avoiding personal attacks. While it is somewhat generic, it is still relevant and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
