    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument about multiple religions contradicting a single God is more compelling than the personal attacks and ad hominem arguments. It addresses the core issue of the conversation while dismissing the irrelevant and disrespectful comments. This fits a high score as it clearly states which side is more in the right and backs up the position with strong reasoning.",

    },
    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and directly relevant to the discussion about religious diversity and the concept of a single God. It clearly invites a constructive dialogue by asking to focus on the topic and avoid personal attacks or misrepresentations. While it is slightly generic and could be improved with more specific examples, it still effectively guides the conversation toward a more positive and respectful direction. This fits well with a score of 4.",
