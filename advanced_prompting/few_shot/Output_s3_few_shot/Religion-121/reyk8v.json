        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to evaluate the argument by comparing the defensibility of two claims. However, it does not clearly determine which side is more in the right based on common morality and fairness. It also lacks strong, specific arguments to support its position. The statement is somewhat vague and does not fully engage with the nuances of the biblical interpretations and moral considerations at play. This fits a score of 3, as it offers a partially supported take but does not clearly state which side is more in the right or provide strong backing for its position.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and directly relevant to the ongoing discussion, as it encourages participants to focus on specific texts and arguments rather than personal attacks or assumptions. It addresses the heated nature of the conversation and offers a clear direction for more constructive dialogue. While it is somewhat generic, it is still natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
