    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance both sides of the argument, acknowledging the cultural and biological differences of the 7th century while also recognizing the importance of historical context and Hadith studies. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right, nor does it provide strong, concrete arguments to support its position. The mediation is somewhat nuanced but lacks the clarity and strength needed for a 5. This fits better with a score of 3.",

        "rationale": "The mediation directly addresses the core issue of a 9-year-old being married to a 53-year-old, which is a serious and sensitive topic. It emphasizes the importance of discussing the issue without personal attacks or gaslighting, which is appropriate and constructive. The message is clear, relevant, and aims to guide the conversation towards a more respectful and focused discussion. However, it is somewhat generic and could be more specific in its guidance. This aligns with a score of 4.",
