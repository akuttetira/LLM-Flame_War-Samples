    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument against the justification of genocide based on religious texts is more compelling. It acknowledges the moral reprehensibility of such actions regardless of context, which aligns with common moral and ethical standards. However, it does not fully address the claim that all monotheistic gods are the same, and the reasoning is somewhat brief. This fits a score of 4, as it provides a clear and morally sound argument but could be more detailed in its analysis.",
        "score": 4
    },
    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to steer the conversation back to the specific commandments mentioned, which is relevant to the discussion. However, it is somewhat vague and does not clearly guide the conversation in a constructive direction. It lacks specificity in suggesting how to focus on the commandments and their implications, making it less effective than a 5. This fits with a score of 3.",
