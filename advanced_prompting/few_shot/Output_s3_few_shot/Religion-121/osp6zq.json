    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument about religion grounding morality is more defensible than the claim that atheists lack morality. It acknowledges the weakness in the latter argument by pointing out its reliance on anecdotal evidence and cherry-picked examples. This shows a fair and balanced assessment of the opposing viewpoints, which aligns well with a high score.",

    },
    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant, aiming to guide the conversation towards focusing on specific issues rather than making generalizations. It acknowledges the difficulty in understanding each other's perspectives and encourages a more constructive dialogue. However, it is somewhat generic and could come across as overly polite or AI-generated. It has a reasonable chance of improving the dialogue, which aligns with a score of 4.",
