    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the argument that the Quran's perceived imperfections and contradictions are used to challenge the divine infallibility of Islam, which is a significant point in the conversation. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right, nor does it provide strong, concrete arguments to support its position. The statement is somewhat nuanced but lacks the depth and clarity needed for a 5. This fits a 3, as it offers a partially supported take without clearly determining who is in the right.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages a constructive dialogue by focusing on specific verses from the Quran. It addresses the topic directly and invites a more respectful and informed discussion. While it is slightly generic and could benefit from more tailored examples, it is still relevant and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
