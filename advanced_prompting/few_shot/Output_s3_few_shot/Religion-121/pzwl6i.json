    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the person highlighting the inconsistency in how Christians handle historical evidence and expertise is more in the right, as it addresses the core issue of selective engagement with historical evidence. The argument is grounded in the conversation's context and provides a nuanced take on the disagreement between the two sides. However, it could have been more explicit in its reasoning and support for this conclusion. This fits with a score of 4.",

        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the heated discussion and suggests focusing on the actual argument while promoting civility. It is conciliatory and relevant to the conversation, encouraging respect and common ground. However, it is somewhat generic and could sound more natural if it provided more specific guidance or addressed the underlying tensions. This aligns with a score of 4.",
