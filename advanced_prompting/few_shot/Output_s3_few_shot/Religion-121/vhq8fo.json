    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to evaluate the arguments by acknowledging the possibility of moral accountability in the context of hell. It suggests that the side which addresses the idea of punishment for 'as-holes' is more in the right. However, this assessment is somewhat vague and does not clearly define what constitutes 'as-holes' or provide strong supporting arguments from the conversation. The score is a 3 because it offers a partially supported take but lacks clarity and depth in justifying its position.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages the participants to focus on specific arguments rather than assumptions or personal attacks. It directly addresses the issue of getting caught up in personal attacks and suggests a more nuanced exploration of the concept of hell. While it is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like an AI, it is still reasonably natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
