    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies the flaw in the argument that religious popularity is evidence of its validity, pointing out that it relies on an unwarranted assumption about a god's behavior. It provides a clear, defensible position that aligns with common moral and logical standards. The argument is well-supported and directly addresses the core issue of the conversation. This warrants a score of 5.",
        "score": 5
    },
    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to steer the conversation towards a more constructive direction by focusing on the personal meaning and purpose people find in their faith, rather than the popularity of religions. It is somewhat relevant and offers a neutral perspective, but it feels a bit generic and lacks the specificity needed to guide the conversation effectively. The message is not deeply engaging or tailored to the specific arguments being made, which reduces its effectiveness. This aligns with a score of 3.",
