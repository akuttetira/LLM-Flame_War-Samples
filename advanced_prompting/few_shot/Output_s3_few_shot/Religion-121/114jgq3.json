    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the claim that God is inherently evil is less defensible than the argument that God's morality is subjective. It acknowledges the lack of objective basis for the 'evil God' claim and highlights the stronger case for subjectivity. However, it does not fully engage with the nuances of the debate or provide a clear, well-supported conclusion. This fits a score of 4 as it offers a reasonable judgment with some depth but could be more comprehensive.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages a respectful discussion about morality and God's role, which is relevant to the conversation. It acknowledges the heated nature of the exchange and suggests a shift towards focusing on specific arguments rather than personal attacks. However, it is somewhat generic and could sound more like a generic AI response rather than a natural, human-like mediation. This fits a score of 3 as it is conciliatory but lacks the specificity and naturalness needed for a higher score.",
