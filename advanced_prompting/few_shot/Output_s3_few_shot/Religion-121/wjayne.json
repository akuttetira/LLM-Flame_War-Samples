        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges a nuanced perspective by recognizing that the argument about protecting men's libido has some merit, especially in the context of historical vulnerability. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right, nor does it provide strong, well-supported arguments. The response is somewhat generic and lacks the depth needed for a 5. This fits a score of 3, as it offers a partially supported take without clearly determining who is in the right.",

        "rationale": "The message is conciliatory and encourages a discussion on the intersection of modesty, power dynamics, and consent, which is relevant to the conversation. It avoids taking sides and opens the door for a more constructive dialogue. However, it is somewhat generic and could come off as overly academic or distant from the emotional tone of the discussion. This fits with a score of 3, as it is conciliatory but lacks the specificity and naturalness needed for a higher score.",
