    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument defending Muhammad\u2019s marriage to Aisha as not a serious issue is more problematic than the claim that it was predatory and abusive. It acknowledges the ethical concerns raised by the conversation and provides a clear judgment that aligns with common moral and ethical standards. The reasoning is strong and directly addresses the core issue of the debate. This fits a score of 5.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant to the discussion, focusing on the age of consent and power dynamics. It acknowledges the historical context and the evolution of Islamic teachings, which helps guide the conversation towards a more constructive direction. However, it is somewhat generic and could be more tailored to the specific arguments being made. This aligns with a score of 3.",
