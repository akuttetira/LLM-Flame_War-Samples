    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the argument, recognizing that while God may have the right to create, He also has a moral responsibility to prevent suffering. This shows some nuance and understanding of the discussion. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right, nor does it provide strong, concrete arguments to support its position. This fits with a score of 3, as it offers a partially supported take without clearly determining who is more in the right.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages participants to acknowledge the complexity of the issue and the influence of personal experiences and biases. It is relevant to the discussion and invites a more reflective and open-minded approach. While it is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like an AI, it is still reasonably natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
