        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that Mangalz's broad generalizations about atheists are more problematic than the original claim. It acknowledges the original point about applying evidence standards to religion and highlights the issue with Mangalz's sweeping statements. However, it does not fully address the nuances of the debate or provide strong arguments against Mangalz's position. This fits a score of 3, as it offers a partially supported take but lacks the depth and clarity of a 5.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and directly addresses the heated tone of the conversation, encouraging a return to the original topic of differing standards for evidence and belief. It suggests a constructive approach by focusing on the core issue rather than personal attacks or assumptions. While it is somewhat generic, it is still relevant and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
