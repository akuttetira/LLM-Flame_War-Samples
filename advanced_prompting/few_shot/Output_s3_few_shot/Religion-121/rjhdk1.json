    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the argument regarding God's character and the suffering in the world, which shows some understanding of the nuances in the discussion. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right, nor does it provide strong, concrete arguments to support its position. The statement is somewhat vague and lacks the depth needed to convincingly argue one side over the other, which fits with a mid-level score.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The message is conciliatory and acknowledges the passionate nature of the discussion. It invites mutual learning and emphasizes shared humanity, which is relevant to the conversation. However, it is somewhat generic and lacks specific, actionable steps to guide the dialogue. It could be more effective by focusing on specific points of agreement or common values. This fits with a score of 3.",
