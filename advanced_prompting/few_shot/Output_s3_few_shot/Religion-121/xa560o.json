    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the mind-body relationship and provides a nuanced perspective by suggesting that the argument for intentionality is more defensible than the claim that the mind is purely physical. It does not take a clear stance on which side is more correct but offers a balanced view that reflects the ongoing philosophical debate. However, it lacks specific arguments or references to the conversation to fully support its position, which limits its effectiveness as a judgement. This fits a score of 3.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages participants to learn from each other's insights, which is relevant to the ongoing discussion about the mind-body problem. It invites a constructive dialogue by focusing on finding common ground, which is a positive approach. However, it is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like an AI-generated message. It is still reasonably natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue, which aligns with a score of 4.",
