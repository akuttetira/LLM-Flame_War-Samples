        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the person pointing out the flaws in the argument for a universally accepted Bible is more in the right, as they engage with the underlying issues and challenge the assumptions of the other side. However, the mediation is somewhat vague and does not provide strong, concrete arguments to back up its position. It also fails to clearly address the complexity of the debate around religious authenticity and authentication. This fits with a score of 3, as it shows some correctness but lacks the nuance and support needed for a higher score.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and aims to de-escalate the heated exchange by focusing on the actual arguments rather than personal attacks. It is relevant to the conversation and invites a more constructive discussion about the challenges of authenticating religious texts. However, it is somewhat generic and could sound more like a generic mediation script rather than a natural, nuanced response. This fits with a score of 3, as it is conciliatory but lacks the specificity and contextual relevance that would make it more effective in guiding positive dialogue.",
