    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to evaluate the argument by suggesting that the side emphasizing personal experience with Jesus' teachings is more correct. However, it does not clearly define what constitutes 'correct' in this context, nor does it provide strong, concrete arguments to support this position. The assessment is somewhat vague and lacks the depth needed to confidently determine which side is more right based on common morality and fairness. This fits with a score of 3.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages the participants to find common ground and explore spirituality beyond scripture. It is relevant to the discussion and invites a constructive dialogue. However, it is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like an AI-generated response. It has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue but is not as natural as a 5. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
