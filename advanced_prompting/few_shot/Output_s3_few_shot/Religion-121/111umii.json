    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges that both sides have valid points, which shows a balanced approach. It recognizes the complexity of the argument around the Quran's scientific content and the claim that it is man-made. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right and lacks strong, specific arguments to support its position. This fits with a score of 3, as it offers some nuance but does not provide a clear verdict or strong backing.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages respectful disagreement, which is relevant to the ongoing discussion. It suggests a constructive approach by emphasizing understanding and learning from each other. However, it is somewhat generic and could feel more like a standard AI response rather than a natural, nuanced guide. This aligns with a score of 3, as it is conciliatory but lacks the specificity and natural tone that would elevate it to a higher score.",
