    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to evaluate the argument about the universe's design implying a creator, but it fails to clearly determine which side is more in the right. It makes a vague comparison without providing strong, concrete arguments or addressing the core issues in the conversation. The statement is somewhat neutral but lacks the depth and clarity needed to be a strong judgement. This fits with a score of 3.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages the participants to focus on the unknown aspects of the universe rather than personal attacks or assumptions. It is relevant to the ongoing discussion about the existence of a higher power and offers a constructive direction for the conversation. While it is somewhat generic, it is still reasonably natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
