    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the discussion revolves around the definition of faith and its relationship to evidence. It acknowledges the nuanced debate between faith as trust based on evidence and blind faith, which aligns with the conversation's content. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right, nor does it provide strong, concrete arguments to support its position. This fits with a mid-level score where there is some nuance but no clear verdict or strong backing.",

        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the discussion around faith and encourages a focus on evidence, which is relevant and constructive. It invites participants to discuss what types of evidence are most convincing, which could lead to a more productive dialogue. While the message is somewhat generic, it is still conciliatory and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
