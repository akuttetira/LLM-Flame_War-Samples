        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of theistic belief systems and the importance of critical thinking in interpreting religious texts. It recognizes that the side questioning theistic approaches is more in the right by emphasizing the symbolic nature of the Bible and the need for nuanced understanding. However, it does not provide strong, concrete arguments to back up this position, and the conclusion feels somewhat vague. This fits with a score of 3, as it offers a partially supported take rather than a clear, well-argued verdict.",

        "rationale": "The message is conciliatory and encourages mutual understanding, which is relevant to the ongoing discussion. It acknowledges the complexity of the issues and invites participants to avoid oversimplification. However, it is somewhat generic and lacks specific guidance on how to move forward constructively. This fits with a score of 3, as it is conciliatory but not sufficiently tailored to the specific context of the conversation.",
