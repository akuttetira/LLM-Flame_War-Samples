        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the validity of faith and prayer as a means of connection with a higher power, even in the absence of empirical evidence. It recognizes the emotional and spiritual aspects of faith while also addressing the criticism that it can be seen as emotional manipulation. However, it does not fully engage with the stronger arguments against faith, such as the lack of empirical support and the potential for emotional manipulation. This makes it a somewhat balanced but not fully comprehensive judgment, fitting a score of 3.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages mutual learning and finding common ground, which is relevant to the discussion about spirituality, faith, and personal experiences. However, it is somewhat generic and lacks specific, actionable steps to guide the conversation towards a more constructive direction. It feels a bit like a generic AI response rather than a natural, human-led conversation. This fits with a score of 3, as it is conciliatory but somewhat vague and not deeply tied to the specific content of the conversation.",
