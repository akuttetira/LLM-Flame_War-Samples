    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to evaluate the arguments presented in the conversation, acknowledging that the claim about God demonstrating His attributes is more defensible than the claim that God is a cruel monster. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right based on common morality and fairness. The argument about God's attributes is presented as more defensible, but the mediation lacks strong, clear support for this position and does not adequately address the moral concerns raised about God's cruelty. This fits a score of 3 as it offers a partially supported take without clearly establishing the right side.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and aims to redirect the conversation towards the specific ideas being discussed, rather than personal attacks. It is relevant to the ongoing debate about God's attributes and their purpose, and invites a more nuanced exploration of the topic. While it is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like an AI, it is still reasonably natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
