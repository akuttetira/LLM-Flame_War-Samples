        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument about non-acts (thoughts) being equally sinful as actions is more defensible than the blanket claim that homosexuality is inherently immoral. It acknowledges the complexity of the issue and provides a nuanced perspective that aligns with the conversation's arguments. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right, and the supporting arguments are somewhat general. This fits a score of 3, as it offers a partially supported take rather than a clear determination of right and wrong.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant, encouraging a discussion on the complexity of morality. It avoids taking sides and invites a broader perspective on how context, culture, and personal experience shape moral views. While it is somewhat generic, it is still natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
