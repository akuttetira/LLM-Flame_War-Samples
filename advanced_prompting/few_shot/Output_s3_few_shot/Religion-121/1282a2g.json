    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to evaluate the argument by comparing two positions: one that criticizes God's justice as cruel and the other that upholds God's authority. It acknowledges the validity of the first argument but does not clearly determine which side is more in the right. The reasoning is somewhat nuanced but lacks strong, concrete arguments to support its conclusion. This fits a score of 3, as it offers a partially supported take without clearly stating which side is more justified.",

        "rationale": "The message is conciliatory and invites a discussion on moral relativism, which is relevant to the conversation about differing moral standards and justifications. It is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like an AI, but it is still reasonably natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
