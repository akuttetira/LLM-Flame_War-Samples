        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the scientific consensus on the universe's origin (the Big Bang) is more supported by evidence than the claim of intentional design by a higher power. It provides a clear, evidence-based argument that aligns with scientific understanding. The statement is well-reasoned and directly addresses the core of the debate, making it a strong judgment. This fits a score of 5.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages a focus on shared scientific topics like the Big Bang and evolution, which aligns with the conversation's content. It suggests a constructive approach to discussion by avoiding direct confrontation. While it is somewhat generic and could sound AI-generated, it is still relevant and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This fits well with a score of 4.",
