    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges that the people questioning the sincerity of theists are more in the right, which aligns with the discussion in the conversation where many users critique theistic beliefs as insincere or based on psychological factors. However, it does not provide strong, concrete arguments to back this position, nor does it fully address the complexities of faith and human psychology. This fits a mid-level score where there is some nuance but not a clear, strongly supported verdict.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The message is conciliatory and encourages participants to focus on shared experiences and common ground, which is relevant to the discussion about faith and personal experiences. It avoids taking sides and invites a more constructive dialogue. While it is somewhat generic, it is still natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
