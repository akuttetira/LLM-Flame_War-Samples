    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance the discussion by acknowledging the complexity of God's nature and the limitations of human understanding. It recognizes that dismissing God's existence solely due to human comprehension is not as defensible as the argument for a God beyond human understanding. However, it lacks clarity in defining what makes one argument more reasonable and does not provide strong, specific support for its position. This places it around a mid-level score where there is some reasoning but not strong enough to warrant a higher score.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant, encouraging a discussion on the relationship between faith and skepticism. It acknowledges the complexity of the topic and invites a more balanced perspective. While it is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like an AI, it is still reasonably natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
