        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the problematic assumptions of both sides, which shows some understanding of the debate. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right, nor does it provide strong arguments or a clear judgment. The statement is somewhat balanced but lacks the depth and conviction needed for a 5. This fits better with a score of 3, as it offers a partially supported take without fully resolving the issue.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages a constructive dialogue by focusing on specific aspects of God's nature or existence. It is relevant to the discussion and invites a productive exchange of ideas. While it is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like an AI, it is still reasonably natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
