        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the discussion around consciousness and the material vs. immaterial debate, which is appropriate given the depth of the conversation. It also provides a nuanced assessment by suggesting that the argument for non-material consciousness is more defensible than the outright dismissal of such ideas. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right based on common morality and fairness, and the supporting arguments are somewhat vague. This fits with a score of 3, as it offers a partially supported take without a clear verdict.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages the participants to explore a more nuanced understanding of consciousness and the soul. It acknowledges the complexity of the discussion and invites a more open-ended exploration of the topic. While it is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like an AI, it is still reasonably natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
