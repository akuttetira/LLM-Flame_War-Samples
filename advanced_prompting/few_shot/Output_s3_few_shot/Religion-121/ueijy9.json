    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to address the argument about the afterlife and child sacrifice, acknowledging the complexity of the issue. However, it fails to clearly determine which side is more in the right and does not provide strong, concrete arguments to support its position. The statement is somewhat nuanced but lacks the depth and clarity needed for a 5. It also does not adequately address the ethical concerns raised by the participants, particularly the potential for misuse of such arguments. This fits better with a score of 3.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and directly relevant to the conversation, aiming to redirect the discussion towards the core topic of the afterlife and morality. It encourages respectful debate and acknowledges the heat in the conversation. While it is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like an AI, it is still reasonably natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
