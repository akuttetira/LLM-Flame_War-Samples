    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to address the argument by comparing the two claims, but it does so in a way that is somewhat vague and lacks clear reasoning. It does not directly engage with the specific points made in the conversation, nor does it clearly determine which side is more in the right. The comparison between the two claims is not sufficiently detailed or supported by the conversation's content. This places it at a mid-level score where there is some attempt at analysis but not a strong or clear judgment.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and directly relevant to the conversation, encouraging a focus on specific behaviors or statements rather than generalizations. It addresses the issue of blanket statements about atheists and promotes a more constructive dialogue by encouraging examination of specific examples. While it is slightly generic and could be more tailored, it still effectively guides the conversation toward a more nuanced and constructive direction. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
