    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the concern about religious people being exploited is a more defensible position compared to the dismissive labels of 'addict' or 'mentally ill'. It acknowledges the validity of the argument against religious exploitation while critiquing the more harsh and generalized criticism. This shows a nuanced understanding of the conversation and provides a fair assessment of the positions presented. The score reflects this balanced and fair judgment.",

        "rationale": "The mediation suggests separating personal experiences from philosophical debates, which is a constructive and relevant approach. It acknowledges the shift in the conversation and invites a more balanced discussion. While it is slightly generic and could be more specific, it still guides the conversation toward a more constructive direction. This fits well with a score of 4.",
