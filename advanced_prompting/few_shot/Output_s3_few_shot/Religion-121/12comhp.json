        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the issue and recognizes that both perspectives have merit. It does not clearly state which side is more in the right but provides a balanced view that acknowledges the difficulty of reconciling faith with suffering. However, it lacks strong, specific arguments to support its position and does not clearly favor one side over the other. This fits with a score of 3.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and acknowledges the complexity of the discussion around faith, suffering, and divine justice. It encourages empathy and understanding rather than focusing on winning an argument, which is relevant to the conversation. However, it is somewhat generic and lacks specific guidance on how to move forward constructively. This aligns with a score of 3.",
