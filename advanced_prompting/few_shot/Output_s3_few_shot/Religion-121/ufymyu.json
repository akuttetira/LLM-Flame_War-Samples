        "rationale": "The mediation incorrectly frames the debate by suggesting that the patriarchal interpretation of biblical texts is more problematic than the claim about modern relationships. This fails to address the core issue of how religious texts are being used to justify harmful practices. It also lacks a clear, supported stance on which side is more in the right, making it a weak judgment. This fits with a score of 2, as it does not correctly determine who is in the right and provides weak supporting arguments.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant, encouraging a focus on specific examples and interpretations rather than broad generalizations. It addresses the issue of both sides making sweeping statements about the entire Christian faith, which is a common problem in the conversation. While it is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like an AI, it still manages to guide the conversation towards a more constructive direction. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
