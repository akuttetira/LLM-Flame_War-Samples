        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument for a higher power based on the lack of clear proof is more defensible than the dismissive and hostile stance towards the faith. It acknowledges the validity of the opposing viewpoint while pointing out the flaw in the aggressive dismissal. This shows a fair and balanced assessment, which aligns with a score of 5.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and aims to de-escalate the conversation by focusing on ideas rather than personal attacks. It is relevant to the discussion and invites a constructive exploration of arguments for and against the existence of a higher power. While it is somewhat generic, it is still natural in context and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
