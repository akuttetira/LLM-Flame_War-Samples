        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that dismissing the emotional impact of suicidal ideation and blaming the person for not being able to cope is more hurtful and unhelpful than the initial claim. It acknowledges the complexity of mental health issues and the importance of empathy, which aligns with common morality and fairness. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right but offers a nuanced, partially supported take. This fits best with a score of 3.",

        "rationale": "The message is conciliatory and focuses on shared concern for mental health, which is relevant to the conversation. It invites participants to share personal stories or resources, which could guide positive dialogue. However, it is somewhat generic and lacks the specificity needed to address the complex issues raised in the conversation. This fits with a score of 3, as it is conciliatory but somewhat vague and not deeply tailored to the context.",
