        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance the arguments by acknowledging both sides but ultimately leans towards defending the medical procedure argument. However, it does not provide strong, concrete evidence or reasoning to support this stance. The argument is somewhat vague and lacks the depth needed to convincingly justify one side over the other, making it a mid-level score.",

        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the strong emotions and differing viewpoints in the conversation and suggests focusing on facts and consequences rather than personal attacks. It is relevant and encourages constructive dialogue by shifting the focus to the topic at hand. However, it is somewhat generic and could be more specific in guiding the conversation towards factual discussion. This fits a score of 4.",
