        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that dismissing deleted content as irrelevant or trollish is more in line with fair and impartial judgment, as it acknowledges the importance of not engaging with or defending deleted content. However, it lacks specific arguments or evidence from the conversation to support this claim, making it somewhat generic. This fits a score of 3, as it shows some understanding but does not provide strong or concrete support for its position.",

        "rationale": "The message is conciliatory and directly relevant to the ongoing discussion, encouraging participants to focus on the actual arguments rather than discrediting others. It is reasonably natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. However, it is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like an AI, which slightly reduces its effectiveness. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
