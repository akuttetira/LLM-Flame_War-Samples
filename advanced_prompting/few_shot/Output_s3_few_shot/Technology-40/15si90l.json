        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that those questioning the validity of Madison's allegations with a focus on evidence and timing are more in the right than those dismissing her claims without consideration. It acknowledges the complexity of the situation and the need for skepticism, which aligns with the principles of fair and balanced judgment. However, it does not fully address the potential seriousness of the allegations or provide a clear, morally grounded justification for its position. This fits a score of 4, as it shows a good understanding of the situation and offers a nuanced take with reasonable support.",

        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the situation, including the power dynamics and the importance of supporting survivors. It encourages a more nuanced discussion about the consequences of speaking out against powerful figures and the need for support for survivors. While it is relevant and offers a constructive direction, it is somewhat generic and could be more specific in guiding the conversation towards actionable steps. This fits with a score of 3.",
