    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation incorrectly asserts that the argument blaming Maddison for her mental health issues is more problematic than the claim of sexist and abusive workplace behavior. This is a flawed judgment as it fails to acknowledge the validity of the concern about workplace abuse and instead shifts focus to Maddison's alleged responsibility. The mediation does not provide strong or clear support for its position, making it a lower score.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant, encouraging a focus on facts and the impact on Maddison's well-being. It invites a nuanced discussion about toxic work environments and support for affected individuals. While it is somewhat generic, it is still natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
