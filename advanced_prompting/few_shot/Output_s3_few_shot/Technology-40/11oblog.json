        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the N-word's usage and the role of context, which reflects a nuanced understanding of the conversation. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right or provide strong, specific arguments to support its position. The statement is somewhat vague and does not fully engage with the detailed arguments presented in the conversation. This fits a mid-level score where there is some nuance but no clear verdict or strong backing.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The message is conciliatory and encourages respectful dialogue, focusing on understanding perspectives and avoiding personal attacks. It is relevant to the discussion about language, culture, and the use of the N-word, and invites a constructive conversation. However, it is somewhat generic and could be more specific in addressing the nuances of the debate. This aligns with a score of 3, as it is conciliatory but lacks the specificity and naturalness needed for a higher score.",
