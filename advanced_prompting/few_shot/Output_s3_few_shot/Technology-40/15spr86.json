    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument about the 6 9s being a realistic and expensive target for tech companies is more convincing than the joke claim. It acknowledges the technical validity of the 99.9999% availability goal while dismissing the joke as distasteful. This shows a clear judgment based on the conversation's content and provides a reasonable justification, fitting a score of 5.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant, encouraging the discussion to focus on the practical goal of high uptime rather than the comedic intent behind the 6 9s. It invites a constructive dialogue about challenges, which is appropriate for the context. While it is slightly generic, it is still natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This fits a score of 4.",
