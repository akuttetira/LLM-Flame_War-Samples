    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the person defending DiverMary and criticizing AdLucky2882's behavior as toxic and emotionally abusive is more in the right. This judgment aligns with common moral and ethical standards, and it directly addresses the harmful behavior described in the conversation. The argument is clear and backed by the context of the discussion, making this a strong 5.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation directly addresses the main topic of DiverMary's performance and encourages a focused discussion on the game's narrative and what constitutes a 'clutch' performance. It avoids personal attacks and guides the conversation back to the central issue. While it is slightly generic, it is still relevant and likely to encourage constructive dialogue. This fits well with a score of 4.",
