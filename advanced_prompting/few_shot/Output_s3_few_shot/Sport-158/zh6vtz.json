        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to evaluate the debate around Messi's 'no look' assist by suggesting that the defender is more in the right. However, it oversimplifies the complex discussion about soccer skills and terminology. The mediation does not provide a balanced analysis of the arguments, nor does it address the nuances of football terminology and skill. It also fails to consider the broader context of the conversation, which includes cultural and linguistic misunderstandings. This makes it a weak judgment with limited support for its position.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and attempts to redirect the conversation towards a more positive focus on Messi and the 'no look' pass. However, it is somewhat generic and fails to address the underlying tensions in the conversation, such as the debate over terminology and the criticism of certain participants. While it is relevant and could guide positive dialogue, it lacks the specificity and natural tone needed for a 5. This fits better with a score of 3.",
