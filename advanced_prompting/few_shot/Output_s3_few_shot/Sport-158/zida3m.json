    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the situation by recognizing that both teams showed poor sportsmanship and that Van Gaal\u2019s emotional response and Messi\u2019s mocking gestures were unacceptable. It also correctly identifies that blanket accusations of racism and xenophobia are not supported by the evidence. This shows a balanced and fair assessment of the situation, which aligns with a high score.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and directly relevant to the conversation, encouraging participants to focus on the game rather than personal attacks. It acknowledges the passion for football while promoting a more constructive dialogue. The message is reasonably natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue, though it could be slightly more specific in its suggestions. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
