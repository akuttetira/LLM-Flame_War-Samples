    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies the more credible argument that advertising is a long-term process and that the ad was likely created before the game, rather than the claim of a rigged game. It provides a clear judgment based on the context of advertising practices, which aligns with common knowledge. This fits a high score as it directly addresses the core issue and provides a well-reasoned conclusion.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and directly relevant to the conversation, encouraging a focus on facts and the advertising process. It addresses the conspiracy theories mentioned and invites a constructive discussion about the ad's effectiveness. While it is slightly generic and could be improved with more specific examples, it is still natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This fits a score of 4.",
