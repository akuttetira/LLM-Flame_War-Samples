        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the cultural context around South American football fans and challenges the simplistic label of Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s comments as immature. It provides a more nuanced perspective by recognizing the cultural differences and the broader context of fan behavior. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right, nor does it provide strong, concrete arguments to support its position. This fits with a score of 3, as it offers some nuance but lacks a clear verdict or strong backing.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and attempts to address the issue without generalizing an entire culture based on one person's words, which is a positive approach. It also acknowledges Mbapp\u00e9's maturity in the end, which is a constructive point. However, the message feels somewhat generic and could be more naturally phrased as a human would. It is still relevant to the conversation and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue, which aligns with a score of 4.",
