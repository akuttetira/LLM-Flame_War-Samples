        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the validity of the argument about the US team's goal-scoring issues while also recognizing the importance of defense, which shows a nuanced understanding of the discussion. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right or provide strong, concrete supporting arguments. This fits a score of 3, as it offers some nuance but lacks a clear determination of right and wrong.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant, encouraging the discussion to focus on team performance rather than personal attacks. It directly addresses the issue of personal attacks and invites constructive dialogue about strategies and improvements. While it is somewhat generic, it is still natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
