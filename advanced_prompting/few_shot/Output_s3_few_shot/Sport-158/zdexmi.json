    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the discussion around Yugoslavia's potential team, recognizing that both sides present valid points. However, it does not clearly determine which side is more in the right or provide strong, specific arguments to support its position. It offers a balanced but vague statement that lacks the depth needed for a strong judgement. This fits with a score of 3, as it shows some nuance but does not clearly state which side is more correct or back up its position with strong arguments.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and directly relevant to the conversation, encouraging a focus on facts and history rather than generalizations or personal attacks. It addresses the issue of heated discussions and promotes a more constructive approach. While it is somewhat generic, it is still natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
