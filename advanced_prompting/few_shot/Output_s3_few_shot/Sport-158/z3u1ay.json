        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the debate around the type of goal Richarlison scored, which is appropriate given the technical nature of the discussion. However, it does not clearly determine which side is more correct or provide strong arguments to support its position. The statement is somewhat vague and lacks the specific analysis needed to fully resolve the disagreement, which is why it earns a mid-level score.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and directly relevant to the conversation, encouraging a focus on the actual goal and its significance rather than personal attacks. It suggests a constructive way to move the discussion forward by clarifying the type of goal and its importance to soccer fans. While it is slightly generic, it is still natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This fits well with a score of 4.",
