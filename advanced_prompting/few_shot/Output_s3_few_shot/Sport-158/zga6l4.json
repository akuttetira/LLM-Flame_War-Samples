        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the discussion, recognizing that while some fans may act obnoxiously, it is not unique to Morocco and that their win is a legitimate achievement. However, it does not clearly determine which side is more in the right, nor does it provide strong, concrete arguments to support its position. This fits a score of 3, as it offers some nuance but lacks a clear verdict or strong backing.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant, encouraging the group to focus on the match and the excitement of the win rather than personal attacks. It acknowledges Morocco's victory as a positive story, which aligns with the conversation. While it is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like an AI, it is still reasonably natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
