    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation incorrectly assigns moral superiority to the person defending the author's perspective, which includes racist remarks. It fails to address the racism in the comments and instead focuses on the context of the discussion. This is a clear misjudgment of who is more in the right, as the racist comments are not justified or respectful. The score is low because the mediation is wrong and does not provide a fair or neutral assessment.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant, aiming to guide the conversation away from personal attacks and towards the events described. It encourages a more neutral discussion by focusing on separating content from the author's identity. While it is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like an AI, it is still reasonably natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
