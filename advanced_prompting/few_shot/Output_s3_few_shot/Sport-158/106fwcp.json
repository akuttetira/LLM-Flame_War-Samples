        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument about Messi\u2019s handball being omitted is more defensible than the dismissive and hurtful responses. It acknowledges a valid point in the conversation and critiques the tone of the other responses, which shows fairness and nuance. However, it does not fully address the broader context or provide a clear judgment on which side is more in the right. This fits a score of 4, as it offers a reasonable and balanced assessment with some depth.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and directly relevant to the conversation, encouraging a focus on the animation and the omission of the handball incident. It frames the discussion in a respectful manner and invites constructive dialogue. While it is slightly generic and could benefit from more specificity, it is still natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
