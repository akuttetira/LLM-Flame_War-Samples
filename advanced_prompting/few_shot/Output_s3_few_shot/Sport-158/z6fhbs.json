        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the argument that the US had a strong performance in 1942 and recognizes that dismissing it outright is less defensible. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right and provides only a vague, balanced statement without strong supporting arguments. This fits a score of 3, as it offers some nuance but lacks the clarity and support needed for a higher score.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and directly relevant to the conversation, guiding the discussion back to factual information about the World Cup's absence in 1942 and 1946. It suggests a constructive direction by focusing on the US's actual performance rather than speculation. While it is slightly generic, it is still natural and likely to improve the dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
