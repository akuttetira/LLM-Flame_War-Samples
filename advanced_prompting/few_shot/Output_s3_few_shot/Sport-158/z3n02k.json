        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the person highlighting the salary contrast is in the right, as they are pointing out a factual difference in income between a reporter and a sports player. The mediation acknowledges the concern and dismisses the mocking labels like 'tripped' or 'fanboying', which is fair and in line with common morality. However, the mediation is somewhat brief and lacks detailed reasoning or context, which could have strengthened its argument. This fits a score of 4, as it correctly identifies the right side but could have provided more thorough support.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages a constructive dialogue by focusing on the broader topic of sports journalism and player compensation. It is relevant to the conversation and invites specific, thoughtful input from the participants. While it is slightly generic and could be more tailored to the specific context, it still feels natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
