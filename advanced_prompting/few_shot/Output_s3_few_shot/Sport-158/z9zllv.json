        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that drawing parallels between historical colonialism and a soccer match is more inflammatory and divisive than insightful. It directly addresses the issue raised in the conversation and provides a clear, defensible stance against such comparisons. The argument is well-reasoned and aligns with common moral and ethical principles, making it a strong 5.",
