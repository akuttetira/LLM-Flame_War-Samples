    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the argument regarding European dominance in football and cultural disrespect, which shows some nuance. However, it does not clearly determine which side is more in the right or provide strong, concrete supporting arguments from the conversation. The statement is somewhat vague and does not fully engage with the specific claims made in the discussion. This fits a score of 3, as it offers partial insight but lacks a clear verdict or strong backing.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively steers the conversation away from personal attacks and focuses on the intended topic of cultural differences in football. It is relevant, encourages constructive dialogue, and invites specific examples from the participants' experiences. While it is somewhat generic, it is still natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
