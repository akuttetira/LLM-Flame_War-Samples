    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument asserting Pele's superiority without room for discussion is more divisive and less respectful. It acknowledges the validity of differing opinions and the importance of respectful disagreement, which aligns with common morality and fairness. However, it does not explicitly state that the opposing view (that Pele is not the greatest) is equally valid or provide strong arguments to support that position. This fits a 4, as it correctly identifies the issue but could have provided stronger support for the alternative perspective.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages a respectful discussion about Pele\u2019s legacy while acknowledging the subjective nature of evaluating greatness. It guides the conversation toward a more constructive direction by asking for personal perspectives rather than engaging in debate. While it is slightly generic, it is still relevant and natural in context, making it a good steering message. This fits well with a score of 4.",
