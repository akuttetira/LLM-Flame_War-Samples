        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the nuance of the debate by highlighting that past achievements don't fully define someone's current character, which is a fair and balanced perspective. However, it doesn't clearly determine which side is more in the right and lacks specific arguments to support its position. This fits a score of 3, as it offers some nuance but doesn't decisively resolve the conflict or provide strong backing for its stance.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and directly addresses the issue of maintaining civility in the discussion. It encourages constructive dialogue by focusing on specific aspects of the rule change rather than personal attacks. While it is slightly generic, it is still relevant and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This fits a score of 4.",
