        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that attributing violence to Moroccan ethnicity is a flawed generalization, and it appropriately emphasizes the team's skill and dedication as a more defensible explanation. It addresses the core issue of racial bias in the discussion and provides a clear, fair critique of the opposing view. This aligns with a high score as it accurately judges the situation and supports its position with relevant reasoning.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and directly relevant to the conversation, encouraging participants to separate the sport from the emotions and avoid generalizing groups of people. It is well-timed and offers a constructive direction for the discussion. However, it is somewhat generic and could feel a bit like a generic AI response. This fits well with a score of 4.",
