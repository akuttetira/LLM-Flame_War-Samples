        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the argument about the US victory in the War of Independence being relevant, which is a reasonable point. However, it does not clearly determine which side is more in the right, nor does it provide strong, concrete arguments to support its position. It also fails to address the inflammatory and disrespectful language used in the conversation. This fits a score of 3, as it offers some nuance but lacks a clear verdict or strong supporting arguments.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages a focus on historical context, which is relevant to the conversation. It invites specific, constructive dialogue about the War of Independence and its relevance today. While it is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like an AI, it is still reasonably natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
