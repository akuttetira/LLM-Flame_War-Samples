        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the defenders of Costa Rica are more in the right by acknowledging the unexpected nature of the win and the context of Japan\u2019s poor performance. It also critiques the harsh criticism of Costa Rica\u2019s effort, which is fair given the low number of shots on target. The argument is clear and backed by the context of the match, making it a strong 5.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant, focusing on the game itself rather than the outcome. It encourages a constructive discussion about the factors that contributed to Costa Rica\u2019s win, which aligns with the context of the conversation. While it is slightly generic, it is still natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This fits a score of 4.",
