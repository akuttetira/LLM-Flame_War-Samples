    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the belittlement of Croatia's sports achievements is more defensible and less inflammatory than the classless comments about the Canadian coach. It acknowledges the validity of the argument against the coach's behavior while criticizing the tone of the other comments. This shows a clear understanding of the conversation and a balanced judgment, which aligns with a score of 5.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and directly relevant to the conversation, focusing on the specific comments being made rather than the country or sport. It addresses the strong accusation of 'classless behaviour' and invites reflection on its validity. While it is slightly generic and could be seen as a bit too neutral, it effectively steers the conversation towards a more constructive direction. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
