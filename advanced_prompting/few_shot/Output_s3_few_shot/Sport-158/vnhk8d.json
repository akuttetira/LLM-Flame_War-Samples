    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies the nuanced discussion around Camavinga's potential creativity and the implicit racial bias in evaluating players of color. It acknowledges the validity of the arguments made about player development and the role of stereotypes in football commentary. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right or provide strong, concrete arguments to support its position. This fits with a score of 3, as it offers a partially supported take rather than a clear judgment.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant, guiding the conversation towards a more constructive focus on specific examples of Camavinga's playmaking. It addresses the issue of assumptions based on skin color and position, which is important in the context of the discussion. While it is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like an AI, it is still reasonably natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
