        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to acknowledge the argument about oil money while also addressing the concerns about the tournament's financial and social implications. However, it does not clearly determine which side is more in the right, nor does it provide strong or specific arguments to support its position. The statement is somewhat vague and lacks the clarity and conviction needed for a 5. This fits better with a 3, as it offers a partially supported take without clearly stating which side is more in the right.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages a focus on facts and specific concerns, which is relevant to the discussion about the tournament's finances and social impact. It avoids inflammatory language and promotes civil dialogue. While it is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like an AI, it is still reasonably natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
