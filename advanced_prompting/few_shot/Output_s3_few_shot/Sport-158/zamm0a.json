        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument about having professional jobs in football is more defensible than the claim that only unemployed people watch football. It acknowledges the validity of leisure activities and professional careers in the sport. However, it could have been more nuanced by addressing the broader context of football fandom and the diversity of people who engage with the sport. This fits a score of 4 as it provides a reasonable and fair assessment with some room for nuance.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant, aiming to shift the conversation from a divisive topic about jobs to a more positive and shared experience of football. It is naturally phrased and offers a constructive direction for the dialogue. However, it is somewhat generic and could be more specific in suggesting how to proceed. This aligns with a score of 4.",
