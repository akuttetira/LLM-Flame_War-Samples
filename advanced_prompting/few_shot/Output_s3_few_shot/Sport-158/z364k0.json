        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the debate between British and American food, recognizing that both sides have valid points. However, it does not clearly determine which side is more in the right or provide strong arguments to support its position. The statement is somewhat vague and lacks the depth needed for a 5, but it does show some understanding of the nuanced nature of the discussion. This fits a score of 3.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and acknowledges the subjective nature of food preferences, which is relevant to the conversation. It encourages a more inclusive and positive dialogue by focusing on the shared enjoyment of food rather than nationalistic claims. While it is somewhat generic, it is still natural and has a good chance of guiding the conversation toward a more constructive and respectful direction. This fits well with a score of 4.",
