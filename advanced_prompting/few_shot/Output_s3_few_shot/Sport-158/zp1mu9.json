    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument about France's performance is more defensible than the personal attacks and insults. It addresses the core issue of the conversation while acknowledging the negative behavior. However, it does not provide strong, detailed arguments to back up its position, and it is somewhat vague in its assessment. This fits a score of 3, as it partially supports the correct judgment but lacks depth and clarity.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages respectful disagreement, which is appropriate for the context. It avoids name-calling and focuses on constructive topics like strategy and pressure. While it is somewhat generic and could be seen as overly structured, it is still relevant and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This fits a score of 4.",
