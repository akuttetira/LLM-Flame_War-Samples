    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that criticizing a team's performance is different from insulting their fans, which aligns with the conversation's context. It addresses the key issue of personal attacks versus constructive criticism and provides a balanced perspective. However, it does not go beyond this to clearly state which side is more in the right or offer deeper moral or ethical justification. This fits a score of 4, as it provides a clear and defensible stance with reasonable support.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages respectful disagreement, which is appropriate for the context. It directly addresses the topic of discussion (Japan's penalty shootout and overall game) and invites constructive dialogue. While it is somewhat generic, it is still natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
