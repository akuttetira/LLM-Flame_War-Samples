        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the defenders of the emotional moment and the one who called out the troll are more in the right, as they considered context and emotional nuance. It also correctly criticizes the person who jumped to conclusions without understanding the situation. The argument is clear and backed by the conversation's context, which fits a high score.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant, encouraging participants to focus on the main topic of the FIFA shot rather than personal attacks. It invites constructive dialogue by asking for shared experiences, which aligns with the goal of positive interaction. While it is slightly generic, it is still natural and has a good chance of improving the conversation. This fits a score of 4.",
