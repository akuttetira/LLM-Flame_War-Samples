        "rationale": "The mediation correctly acknowledges the cultural context of playful mocking in football and positions it as a form of sportsmanship rather than disrespect. It addresses the underlying tension between different viewpoints and provides a balanced perspective that is more reasonable than a blanket criticism. However, it does not fully engage with the nuances of the debate or provide strong, specific arguments to support its position. This aligns with a score of 3.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant to the discussion about cultural differences in football culture. It encourages learning from each other rather than judging, which is a positive direction. However, it is somewhat generic and lacks specific, actionable steps to guide the conversation towards a more constructive path. This fits with a score of 3, as it is conciliatory but not deeply tailored to the specific context of the conversation.",
