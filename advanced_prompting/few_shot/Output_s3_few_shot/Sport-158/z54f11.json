        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the debate around soccer's popularity and profitability in the US, which is accurate given the conversation. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right or provide strong, specific arguments to support its position. The statement is somewhat vague and lacks the depth needed for a 5. This fits a score of 3, as it offers some nuance but does not fully address the core issue of who is more correct in the debate.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant, encouraging a focus on factual progress in MLS. It shifts the conversation from debate to discussion of specific examples, which can guide positive dialogue. While it is somewhat generic and could be more tailored to the specific context, it still offers a constructive direction. This fits a score of 4.",
