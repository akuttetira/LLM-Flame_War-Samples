        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges that both sides have valid points: Martinez's actions were indeed classless, and the criticism was overly harsh and dismissive. This shows a balanced understanding of the situation. However, it does not clearly determine which side is more in the right or provide strong, specific arguments to support its position. This fits a score of 3, as it offers some nuance but lacks a clear verdict or strong backing.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and acknowledges differing comfort levels with celebration, which is relevant to the conversation. It suggests a compromise by agreeing that some reactions are more annoying and encourages letting it go. However, it is somewhat vague and lacks specific guidance on how to move forward constructively. This fits a score of 3 as it is conciliatory but not highly effective or natural in context.",
