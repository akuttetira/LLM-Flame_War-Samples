    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to evaluate the argument around the racial implications of calling ViniJnr a monkey. It acknowledges the opposing views and slightly favors the argument that the comparison was not racist but a playful insult. However, it does not provide strong, concrete arguments or evidence to support this position, and the reasoning is somewhat vague. This fits a mid-level score where there is some nuance but not a clear, well-supported verdict.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and attempts to guide the conversation towards a more constructive direction by encouraging participants to focus on language and intent rather than making assumptions. It is relevant to the ongoing debate and offers a clear path for more productive dialogue. However, it is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like a generic mediation script. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
