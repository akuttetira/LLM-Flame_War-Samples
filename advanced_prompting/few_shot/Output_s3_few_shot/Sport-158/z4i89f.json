    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the dispute over terminology is about regional preference rather than personal insults, which aligns with the conversation's context. It provides a reasonable judgment that acknowledges the validity of differing terminology without engaging in the personal attacks present in the conversation. This fits a 4 because it correctly identifies the more reasonable stance but could have provided stronger support or clarity.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively shifts the focus back to the original topic of comparing football and soccer, encouraging a constructive discussion about rules, strategies, and cultural significance. It addresses the negative tone of the conversation by suggesting a more positive direction. While it is slightly generic, it is still relevant and likely to guide positive dialogue. This fits well with a score of 4.",
