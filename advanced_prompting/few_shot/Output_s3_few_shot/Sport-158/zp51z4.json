    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument about the penalties is more defensible than the personal attacks and insults. It acknowledges the validity of the claim that Di Maria\u2019s penalty was legitimate and the referee\u2019s mistake with Thuram\u2019s, which aligns with the conversation\u2019s content. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right but instead focuses on the quality of the arguments. This fits a 4, as it provides a reasonable judgment with some nuance but lacks the strongest support or clarity of a 5.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and directly addresses the issue of name-calling and insults, which are present in the conversation. It encourages a focus on the actual game and refereeing decisions, which is relevant to the discussion. While it is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like an AI, it is still reasonably natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
