    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the argument, recognizing that both sides present valid points regarding rule interpretation and referee decision-making. However, it does not clearly determine which side is more correct or provide strong, concrete arguments to support its position. This fits a score of 3, as it offers some nuance but lacks a clear determination of right or wrong.",

    },
    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and directly relevant to the conversation, as it acknowledges the heated tone and suggests focusing on the game and rules rather than personal attacks. It is naturally phrased and could plausibly be written by a user, making it a strong candidate for a high score. However, it is somewhat generic and could be more specific in its guidance. This fits well with a score of 4.",
