    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument about Messi being a 'douchbag' due to his wealth is more inflammatory than the initial joke. It acknowledges the original context and points out the shift towards more negative and divisive statements. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right or provide strong, concrete arguments to support its position. This fits a score of 3, as it offers some nuance but lacks a clear verdict or strong backing.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively steers the conversation back to the original joke and its humor, while avoiding deeper discussions about wealth, politics, or personal attacks. It is conciliatory, relevant, and encourages a constructive focus on the shared context of the meme. However, it is somewhat generic and could feel a bit like a standard mediation script. This fits a score of 4.",
