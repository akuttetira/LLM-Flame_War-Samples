        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges a nuanced perspective by suggesting that the US team\u2019s loss may reflect broader national sports preferences rather than solely blaming the team. However, it does not clearly determine which side is more in the right or provide strong, specific arguments to support its position. This fits a score of 3, as it offers some nuance but lacks a clear judgment or robust backing.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant to the conversation about why some people may not follow soccer. It invites a constructive discussion about the appeal of soccer and potential barriers to engagement, which could guide positive dialogue. While it is somewhat generic, it is still natural and has a good chance of improving the conversation. This aligns with a score of 4.",
