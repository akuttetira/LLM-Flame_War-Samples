    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to acknowledge the emotional impact of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup matches on some individuals, recognizing their continued pain and justification for it. However, it does not provide a balanced or neutral perspective, as it leans towards validating the feelings of those who are still upset while dismissing the views of those who see the trauma as irrelevant. This one-sided approach does not fully align with the principles of fairness and neutrality, resulting in a lower score.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and aims to guide the conversation toward understanding the emotional impact of specific moments. It acknowledges the strong emotions involved and encourages sharing personal memories, which is relevant to the discussion. However, it is somewhat generic and could feel more like a standard mediation script rather than a natural, context-specific response. This fits a score of 3 as it is conciliatory but lacks the specificity and naturalness that would make it a 4 or 5.",
