        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument for valuing individual brilliance in goals is more defensible than the dismissive stance towards team goals. It acknowledges the validity of both perspectives but leans towards supporting the individual brilliance argument, which is more nuanced and grounded in the discussion. However, it does not provide strong, explicit support for its position, which slightly lowers the score.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and directly relevant to the discussion about individual vs. team goals in football. It acknowledges both perspectives and invites a balanced view, which is constructive and likely to guide positive dialogue. While it is slightly generic, it is still natural and well-timed in the context of the conversation. This fits a score of 4.",
