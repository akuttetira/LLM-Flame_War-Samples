        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the existence of multiple valid terms and positions the advocate for a single, universally accepted term as more in the right, which shows some understanding of the nuanced debate. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right based on common morality and fairness, nor does it provide strong arguments supporting this position. This fits better with a mid-level score where there is some nuance but no clear verdict or strong backing.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and acknowledges the importance of clarity and respect for different perspectives. It encourages the participants to agree to disagree and focus on enjoying the game, which is relevant to the ongoing discussion about the terminology of the sport. However, it is somewhat generic and lacks specific suggestions for constructive dialogue. This fits with a score of 3, as it is conciliatory but not deeply tailored to the conversation's context.",
