        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that ucccft's defense of Argentina and Messi is more justified, given the context of the World Cup victory and global support. It also acknowledges the dismissive and xenophobic nature of Weak-Pudding-322's comments. However, the mediation does not provide strong, concrete arguments to support its position, and it is somewhat vague in its assessment. This fits a score of 3, as it correctly identifies the more justified side but lacks strong supporting arguments.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant to the discussion, focusing on shared appreciation for Messi and the sport. It avoids taking sides in the debate about national pride and encourages a more neutral, positive focus. However, it is somewhat generic and lacks specific, actionable steps to guide the conversation. This fits a score of 3, as it is conciliatory but not deeply tailored to the specific context or offering meaningful direction.",
