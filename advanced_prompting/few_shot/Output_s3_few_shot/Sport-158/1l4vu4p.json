        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges that the Europa League win provides some justification for Ange's management, which is a more balanced view than dismissing his achievements entirely. It offers a nuanced stance that recognizes the value of the trophy while also addressing the league performance. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right, nor does it provide strong, concrete arguments to support its position. This fits a score of 3, as it shows some nuance but lacks a clear verdict or strong backing.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant, encouraging the participants to appreciate Ange\u2019s achievements without immediately judging him on his league performance. It acknowledges a specific point from the conversation and invites a more balanced perspective. While it is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like an AI, it is still reasonably natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
