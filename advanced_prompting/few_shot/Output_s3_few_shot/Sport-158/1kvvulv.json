        "rationale": "The mediation correctly acknowledges the complexity of the debate, recognizing that while football has become increasingly political, the claim that it has always been political is more exaggerated. It provides a balanced view by distinguishing between historical context and modern political engagement. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right or provide strong, specific arguments to support its position. This fits a score of 3, as it offers some nuance but lacks a clear verdict or strong backing.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages the participants to focus on specific examples rather than personal attacks. It is relevant to the ongoing discussion and invites a constructive dialogue by suggesting learning from each other's perspectives and finding common ground. While it is somewhat generic, it is still reasonably natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
