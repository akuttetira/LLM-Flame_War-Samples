        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the discussion around Pel\u00e9's legacy and contrasts it with the personal attacks and accusations of racism or envy. It provides a balanced perspective by recognizing the nuance in the argument, but it does not clearly state which side is more in the right or offer strong, specific arguments to support its position. This fits a score of 3, as it shows some understanding but lacks clear determination and strong backing.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages a respectful, positive conversation about Pel\u00e9's legacy. It shifts the focus away from negative or divisive comments and invites participants to share personal memories and appreciation for his impact. While it is somewhat generic, it is still relevant and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This fits a score of 4.",
