        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the users defending the poster's design and expressing pride in their creation are more in the right, as they are focusing on the positive aspects of the user's achievement. However, it lacks a clear, morally grounded argument and does not fully address the context of the conversation, which includes mockery and belittlement. This fits a score of 3, as it correctly identifies the more justified side but provides weak or incomplete support.",

        "rationale": "The mediation shifts the focus to the poster itself, which is relevant and constructive. It encourages sharing personal creations, which can foster positive dialogue. However, the message feels a bit generic and not as naturally tailored to the specific context of the conversation. It has a moderate chance of guiding positive dialogue, which aligns with a score of 3.",
