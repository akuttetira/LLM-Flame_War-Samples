    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to address the debate by suggesting that the focus should be on Qatar's specific exploitation of migrant workers rather than dismissing the World Cup altogether. However, it does not fully acknowledge the valid points made about worker exploitation in Western countries or the broader context of global inequality. The argument is somewhat balanced but lacks the nuance and comprehensive analysis needed for a strong judgement, which fits a score of 3.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and directly relevant to the conversation, encouraging a focus on the specific issue of worker exploitation in Qatar. It acknowledges the complexities of the issue and suggests a productive direction for discussion. However, it is somewhat generic and could be more tailored to the specific arguments being made. This fits with a score of 4, as it is relevant and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue, though it could be more natural or specific.",
