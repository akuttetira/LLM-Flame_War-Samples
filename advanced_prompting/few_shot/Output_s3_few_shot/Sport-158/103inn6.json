        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that football culture and development are more significant factors in a country's success than Italian heritage. It provides a clear, reasoned argument that aligns with the conversation's content and offers a balanced perspective. The reasoning is sound and directly addresses the core of the debate, making this a strong judgement.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant, aiming to guide the conversation towards a more constructive focus on football culture and its impact on performance. It acknowledges the passion in the discussion and encourages a shift from opinion to factual analysis. While it is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like an AI, it is still reasonably natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
