        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of cultural norms around public displays of affection in Qatar, which is a nuanced approach. However, it does not clearly determine which side is more in the right or provide strong arguments to support its position. It also fails to address the specific context of the original conversation, which involves a public display of affection between a father and child. This fits with a score of 3, as it offers some nuance but lacks a clear determination of right or wrong and insufficient support for its position.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant, encouraging the discussion to focus on cultural differences rather than assumptions. It invites the participants to share resources or examples, which is a constructive way to guide the conversation. While it is somewhat generic, it is still natural and has a good chance of improving the dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
