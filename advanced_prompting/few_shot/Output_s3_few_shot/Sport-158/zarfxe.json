        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument against Uruguay being a top-tier team is more defensible than the claim that they are a 'big team' based solely on historical achievements. It acknowledges the nuance in the discussion by distinguishing between historical significance and current performance. However, it does not fully address the counterarguments about recent performances and the context of international competition, which slightly weakens its support. This fits with a score of 4.",

        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the differing opinions about Uruguay's status as a 'big team' and encourages a focus on current performance rather than past achievements. This is conciliatory and relevant to the discussion, and it invites a more constructive dialogue by emphasizing current performance. However, it is somewhat generic and could be more specific in guiding the conversation. This fits with a score of 4.",
