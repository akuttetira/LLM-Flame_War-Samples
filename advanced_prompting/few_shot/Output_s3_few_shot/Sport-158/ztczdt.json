        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the defense of the handmade card as a genuine expression of admiration is more in line with common morality and fairness. It acknowledges the context of fandom and personal expression, which is a reasonable interpretation. However, it does not fully address the opposing view or provide a balanced analysis of the situation. This fits a score of 4, as it correctly identifies the more just position but could have been more nuanced in its reasoning.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages a shift in focus to the artwork rather than the author\u2019s intentions. It is relevant to the conversation and invites constructive interaction by asking participants to share their own creations or opinions about the card. While it is somewhat generic, it is still natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
