        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies a flaw in the argument that past performance against a rival is a reliable indicator of future success, which is a key point in the discussion. It also acknowledges the role of a coach's decisions in determining a match's outcome, which is another central issue. The reasoning is sound and directly addresses the core arguments in the conversation. This fits a high score as it provides a clear, nuanced judgment with strong support.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages the group to focus on the game and Messi rather than personal attacks or generalizations. It is relevant to the conversation and invites a more constructive discussion. While it is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like an AI, it is still reasonably natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
