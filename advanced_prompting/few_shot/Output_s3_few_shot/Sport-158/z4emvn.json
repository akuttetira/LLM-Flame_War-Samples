    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the person trying to explain the geographical distinction between Asia and Australia is more in the right, as their argument is based on factual geographical knowledge. Siggi_pop's responses are condescending and dismissive, which is not constructive. The mediation clearly states this conclusion and supports it with the context of the conversation, making it a strong judgment. This aligns with a score of 5.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation successfully shifts the focus from the semantic debate about Australia's geographical classification to the shared excitement of the tournament. It is conciliatory, relevant, and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. However, it is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like an AI-generated response. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
