    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the validity of both perspectives but gives more weight to the argument that Senegal's performance against the Dutch is a better indicator of their potential against England. This shows some nuance and critical thinking, though it doesn't fully resolve the debate or provide strong, concrete supporting arguments. This fits a score of 3, as it offers a partially supported take without clearly determining the right side.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and directly relevant to the conversation, encouraging a more balanced discussion by focusing on facts and inviting consideration of Senegal's strengths. It avoids taking sides and promotes a constructive dialogue by asking for reasons to support the possibility of Senegal beating England. The message is natural and well-timed, making it a strong steering message. This aligns well with a score of 5.",
