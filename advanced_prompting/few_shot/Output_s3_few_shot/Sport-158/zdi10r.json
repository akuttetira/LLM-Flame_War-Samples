        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument against Brazil's cultural celebration of goals as machismo and xenophobic bias is more defensible than the blanket dismissal of their entire culture. It acknowledges the complexity of cultural expressions and the potential for misinterpretation, which shows a nuanced understanding of the discussion. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right but offers a partially supported take. This fits best with a mid-level score where there is some nuance but no clear verdict or strong backing.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant, encouraging participants to focus on specific behaviors rather than generalizing entire cultures. It acknowledges disagreement while promoting a more constructive approach. However, it is somewhat generic and could come off as overly prescriptive or AI-generated, which slightly reduces its naturalness. This fits a score of 4 as it has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue but is not as naturally phrased as a 5.",
