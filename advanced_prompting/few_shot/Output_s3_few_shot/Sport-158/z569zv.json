    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the discussion around Qatar's human rights record, particularly regarding LGBTQ+ issues, and avoids simplistic judgments. It correctly identifies that the conversation is more nuanced than either blanket statements of oppression or uncritical support. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right or provide strong, concrete arguments to support its position. This aligns with a score of 3, as it offers a partially supported take rather than a clear, well-argued judgment.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant, encouraging the participants to focus on specific examples and facts rather than generalizations. It invites a constructive dialogue by asking for concrete issues experienced or seen in Qatar. While it is somewhat generic, it is still natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
