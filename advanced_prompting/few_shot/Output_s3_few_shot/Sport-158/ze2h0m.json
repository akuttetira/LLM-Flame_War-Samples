    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument against Brazilian players' celebratory behavior is more defensible than the blanket accusation of xenophobia and racism against all Brazilians. It acknowledges the complexity of the situation and provides a balanced perspective, which aligns with a high score. The reasoning is clear and supported by the conversation's context.",

    },
    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant, encouraging the group to focus on specific behaviors rather than generalizations. It addresses the tension in the conversation and promotes a more constructive dialogue by shifting the focus to individual actions. While it is somewhat generic, it is still natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
