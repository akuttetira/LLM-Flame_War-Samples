    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument about Croatia's strong team play and strategy is more convincing than the accusation of cowardice. It addresses the core of the debate and provides a balanced perspective. However, it does not fully engage with the nuances of the discussion or provide a clear, comprehensive judgment on which side is more in the right. This places it at a mid-level score.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages a shift in focus from personal opinions to the actual game and broader themes of team success. It is relevant to the conversation and invites constructive dialogue. While it is somewhat generic, it is still natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
