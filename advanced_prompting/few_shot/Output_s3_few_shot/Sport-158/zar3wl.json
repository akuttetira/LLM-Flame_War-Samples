        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that Suarez's past behavior and reputation do contribute to the justified outrage against him, and it provides a more defensible argument than the opposing view. However, it does not fully address the nuance of the debate, such as the difference between past actions and current behavior, or the context of the World Cup. It also lacks detailed supporting arguments, which slightly reduces its strength. This fits a score of 4.",

        "rationale": "The message is conciliatory and encourages a more balanced discussion by focusing on Suarez's actual performance rather than just the controversies. It is relevant to the conversation and invites a constructive, specific discussion. While it is somewhat generic, it is still natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
