    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the debate around luck versus skill in Morocco's victory, which is a nuanced and fair approach. It correctly identifies that the argument about luck is more defensible than the blanket claim that Morocco is a lucky team that will not succeed. However, it does not fully address the broader context of the conversation or provide strong, concrete arguments to support its position. This fits a score of 4, as it shows reasonable nuance and partial support for one side over the other.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and aims to de-escalate the conversation by focusing on Morocco's achievement and team spirit. It acknowledges the win without getting bogged down in personal or bitter criticism. However, it is somewhat generic and lacks specific guidance on how to move forward constructively. It is reasonably natural but not as tailored to the context as it could be, which places it at a 4.",
