        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that questioning the likelihood of a repeat match and the validity of the 'Hand of God' goal is more nuanced and fact-based compared to making blanket claims about team deservingness or player greatness. It acknowledges the complexity of the situation and offers a balanced perspective, though it could have provided more specific reasoning or evidence to support its position. This aligns with a score of 4.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant to the conversation, as it shifts the focus to the actual match and the goal rather than hypotheticals or personal opinions. It invites a constructive discussion about the 1986 match, which is a natural follow-up to the conversation. However, it is somewhat generic and could be more tailored to the specific context of the 2022 World Cup match. This fits a score of 4.",
