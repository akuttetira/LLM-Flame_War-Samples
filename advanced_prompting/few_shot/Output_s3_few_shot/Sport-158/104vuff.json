        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the side defending the World Cup's legitimacy and criticizing the opposing side for bias is more in the right, as it acknowledges the complexity of sports events and the lack of evidence for the claim that the tournament was rigged. However, it does not fully address the emotional and subjective nature of the debate, and the criticism of the opposing side for 'perceived bias' is somewhat vague. This fits a 4, as it provides a reasonable judgment with some support but lacks the strongest possible arguments or nuance.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant, encouraging a shift from personal attacks to discussion of actual gameplay and refereeing. It is well-worded and directly addresses the tone of the conversation, making it likely to guide positive dialogue. While it is not overly natural or personalized, it is still effective and fits well within the context. This aligns with a score of 5.",
