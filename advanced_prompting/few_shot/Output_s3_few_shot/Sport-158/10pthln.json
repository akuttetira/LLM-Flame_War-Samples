    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance the discussion by acknowledging the validity of concerns about Messi's behavior and performance, while also countering the more extreme personal criticisms. However, it still leans towards defending Messi's actions and performance, which does not fully address the nuanced debate in the conversation. The argument is somewhat weak in its support and lacks a clear, neutral stance. This fits with a score of 3.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant, encouraging a focus on specific incidents rather than generalizing about Messi's character or abilities. It addresses the tension in the conversation by suggesting a more constructive approach to discussion. While it is somewhat generic, it is still reasonably natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
