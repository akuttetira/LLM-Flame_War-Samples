    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the defenders of the game are more in the right, as they are countering baseless hate and misinformation. It clearly states that the negative side is spreading unfounded negativity and personal attacks, which aligns with common morality and fairness. However, the mediation lacks specific examples or detailed arguments to back up its position, which slightly reduces its strength. This fits with a score of 4, as it correctly identifies the right side but could have provided stronger support.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and directly addresses the issue of personal attacks and hate speech, which is relevant to the conversation. It encourages a more constructive focus on the game itself rather than attacking opinions. While it is slightly generic and could sound more like a parent or AI, it is still natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
