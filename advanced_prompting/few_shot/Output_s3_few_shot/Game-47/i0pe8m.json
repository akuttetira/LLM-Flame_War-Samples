    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the argument about misinterpretation being more reasonable than the accusations of shilling or fanboy behavior without evidence. It provides a balanced perspective by recognizing the validity of one side's concern while critiquing the other's approach. This fits a 4 score as it offers a nuanced, partially supported take on the situation.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation directly addresses the specific topic of the scene with Ellie under the water, which is central to the conversation. It encourages a focused discussion on the scene's meaning rather than getting sidetracked by political or personal attacks. The message is concise, relevant, and aims to guide the conversation towards a more constructive and meaningful direction. While it is slightly generic, it is still natural and has a good chance of improving the dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
