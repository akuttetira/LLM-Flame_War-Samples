        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the nuanced discussion around the low frame rate in the Spider-Man: Miles Morales suit, recognizing valid points on both sides. It also highlights the argument that the low frame rate is a deliberate artistic choice to show Miles' growth as more compelling. This shows an understanding of the conversation and provides a clear, supported judgment. However, it could have been more detailed in explaining why the artistic choice is more compelling. This fits well with a score of 4.",

        "rationale": "The mediation encourages civil discussion and focuses on the art itself, which is relevant to the conversation. It acknowledges differing opinions and invites a constructive dialogue about the animation style. However, it is somewhat generic and could be more specific in guiding the conversation towards a productive direction. This aligns with a score of 3.",
