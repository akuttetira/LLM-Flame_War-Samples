    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the stock price drop is more likely due to market fluctuations rather than intentional manipulation. It provides a clear, reasoned argument based on the conversation, distinguishing between organic market movement and deliberate stock manipulation. This fits the criteria for a 5, as it accurately ascertains the more reasonable position and supports it with relevant arguments from the conversation.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is conciliatory and directly addresses the issue of personal attacks and inflammatory language. It encourages a focus on facts and actual news, which is relevant to the discussion about stock prices and rumors. While it is somewhat generic, it is still natural in context and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
