    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the discussion, recognizing that both the feasibility and cost of 3D printing custom PS5 side panels have valid points. It does not clearly state which side is more in the right but provides a balanced view of the arguments presented. However, it lacks specific arguments or evidence to support its position, which is a key factor in determining a higher score. This fits with a score of 3.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation encourages a constructive direction by focusing on community-driven projects and marketplaces for custom PS5 accessories. It is relevant to the conversation about 3D printing and customization and invites discussion on collaborative efforts. While it is somewhat generic, it is still natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
