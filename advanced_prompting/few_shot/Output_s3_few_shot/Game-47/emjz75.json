        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument about WWE 2K17 being a good game despite its flaws is more reasonable compared to the inflammatory and personal attacks. It addresses the core issue and contrasts it with the more extreme and disrespectful comments. This fits a high score as it clearly states which side is more in the right and provides a reasonable justification.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and directly relevant to the conversation, as it encourages participants to focus on the game rather than personal insults. It is natural in context and could plausibly be written by a user, making it a strong candidate for a 5. The message is clear, constructive, and has a high chance of guiding positive dialogue.",
