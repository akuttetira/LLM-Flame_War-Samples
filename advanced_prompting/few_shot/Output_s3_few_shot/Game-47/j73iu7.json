        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the nuanced debate between closed captioning and subtitles, recognizing that both terms have valid contexts. It correctly identifies that the initial insult was less significant compared to the deeper discussion about terminology. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right or provide strong arguments to support its position, which is why it earns a 3. The statement is partially supported but lacks the clarity and confidence of a 5.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation shifts the focus from the technical discussion about subtitles and captions to the content of the video, which is a constructive approach. It encourages participants to evaluate the message rather than get stuck in terminology. While it is slightly generic and could be more specific, it is still relevant and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns with a score of 4.",
