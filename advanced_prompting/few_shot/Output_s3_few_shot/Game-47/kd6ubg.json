    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the PS5 controller flash feature was available on the PS4 in 2014, which means the users pointing this out are more accurate. The argument is supported by specific references to the PS4 and the 2014 context, making it a clear and fair judgment based on the conversation. This aligns with a score of 5.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and directly relevant to the conversation, as it aims to shift focus from debates about the novelty of the PS5 controller feature to its actual function and how it works. It is reasonably natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue, though it could be slightly more specific in suggesting how to discuss the feature. This aligns with a score of 4.",
