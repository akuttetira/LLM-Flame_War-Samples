        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that KoreanGamer22's suggestions for addressing the hacking issue and promoting fair play are more reasonable than the blanket claims of 'hackers ruining the game' and 'devs being too scared'. It acknowledges the complexity of the issue and the need for balanced, constructive solutions. This fits well with a score of 4, as it provides a nuanced assessment that recognizes the validity of different viewpoints and offers a more thoughtful perspective than a simple judgment.",

        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the issue of hacking and suggests focusing on solutions rather than blame, which is a constructive approach. It references a specific solution mentioned by another user, which adds relevance. The message is conciliatory and encourages a positive direction, making it likely to guide positive dialogue. However, it could be slightly more specific in suggesting actionable solutions. This aligns with a score of 4.",
