        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument about the game's poor direction and the leaker's actions is more defensible than the blanket claim that the game is ruined by the leaks. It acknowledges the complexity of the situation, distinguishing between the game's content and the controversy around the leaks. However, it does not fully address the broader implications of the leaks or provide a clear, supported conclusion about who is more in the right. This fits a score of 3 as it shows some nuance but lacks a strong, well-supported verdict.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages participants to focus on the game's direction and impact rather than attacking each other. It is relevant to the ongoing discussion and invites a respectful conversation. However, it is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like an AI response. It does not fully address the specific concerns raised in the conversation, which makes it slightly less effective than a 5. This aligns with a score of 3.",
