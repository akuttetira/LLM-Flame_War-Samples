    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument about Felix's past comments and his 'cult following' is more defensible than the dismissive view of his design. It acknowledges the complexity of the situation, recognizing that past actions can influence public perception but does not fully address the validity of the design comparison or the broader context of the discussion. This fits a score of 4 as it provides a nuanced perspective but lacks a definitive conclusion.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively steers the conversation towards the design itself rather than focusing on Felix's personal character, which is a positive direction. It is relevant to the discussion and encourages a more constructive focus. However, it is somewhat generic and could be more specific in how it suggests moving forward. This fits with a score of 4.",
