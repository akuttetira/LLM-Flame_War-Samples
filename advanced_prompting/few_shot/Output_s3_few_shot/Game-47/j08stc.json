        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the criticism of the game's writing and character development is more justified than the dismissive and condescending responses. It acknowledges the valid concerns about the character's motivation and story, while also addressing the tone of the opposing views. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right, nor does it provide strong, concrete arguments to back up its position. This fits with a score of 3, as it shows some nuance but lacks a clear verdict or strong supporting arguments.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages respectful dialogue, which is appropriate given the context of a heated discussion about a video game character. It directly addresses the issue of personal attacks and promotes civil discourse. However, it is somewhat generic and could feel more like a standard moderation message rather than a tailored response to the specific conversation. This fits a score of 4 as it is relevant and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue.",
