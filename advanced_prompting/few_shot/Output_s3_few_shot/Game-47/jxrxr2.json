    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the claim about the launch being botched due to marketing mismanagement is more plausible than the broader claim that the entire industry is inherently flawed. It provides a nuanced assessment that acknowledges the specific context of the launch while dismissing the generalization about the industry. This fits a 4, as it offers a clear, supported judgment with reasonable confidence.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation encourages a more specific and constructive discussion by focusing on examples of marketing decisions leading to shortages, which is relevant to the conversation. It invites participants to share personal experiences, which can foster more meaningful dialogue. However, the message is somewhat generic and could come off as overly prescriptive or AI-generated. It is still reasonably natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue, which aligns with a score of 4.",
