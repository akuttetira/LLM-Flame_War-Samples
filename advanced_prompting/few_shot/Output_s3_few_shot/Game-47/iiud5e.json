        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument for prioritizing console sales is more defensible than the claim that PC ports are inherently better. It acknowledges the complexity of the issue and provides a balanced perspective. However, it does not clearly state which side is more in the right and lacks strong, specific arguments to support its position. This fits a score of 3, as it offers some nuance but does not fully address the core issue with sufficient clarity or strength.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages a balanced discussion about the pros and cons of PC ports without focusing on fanboyism or console wars. It is relevant to the conversation and invites a constructive dialogue. However, it is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like an AI-generated response. This aligns with a score of 4.",
