    "judgement_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to acknowledge the valid points made by those who defend The Last of Us 2, while also addressing the criticisms. However, it does not clearly and fairly evaluate the merits of the game's story or provide a balanced perspective. It leans more towards defending the game rather than offering an impartial assessment. This fits a score of 3, as it offers some nuance but lacks strong, clear arguments for or against the game's story.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and encourages a nuanced discussion about TLOU2, which is relevant to the ongoing debate. It invites specific, constructive feedback about the game's strengths and weaknesses, which could guide positive dialogue. While it is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like an AI, it is still reasonably natural and has a good chance of improving the dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
