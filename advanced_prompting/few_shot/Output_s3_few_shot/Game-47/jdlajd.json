        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the freedom of speech versus corporate responsibility debate, which is a key aspect of the discussion. However, it does not clearly determine which side is more in the right, nor does it provide strong, specific arguments to support its position. The statement is somewhat vague and does not fully engage with the nuances of the conversation, which fits a mid-level score where there is some nuance but no clear verdict or strong backing.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation suggests a discussion on balancing freedom of speech with user safety, which is relevant to the conversation. It encourages a nuanced exploration of the topic rather than taking a definitive stance. However, the message is somewhat generic and doesn't directly address the specific points made in the conversation, such as the difference between platforms and governments, or the context of Sony's policy. This makes it slightly less effective than a more tailored approach, fitting a score of 3.",
