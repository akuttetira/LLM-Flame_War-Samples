        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument about whether a feature that is exploitable by players is a bug is more nuanced and justified than the blanket claim that it's not a bug because it's in the game. It acknowledges the complexity of defining bugs versus features in gaming contexts, which is a fair and balanced approach. This aligns well with a score of 5 as it provides a clear, supported verdict based on the discussion.",

        "rationale": "The message is conciliatory and encourages the participants to focus on specific mechanics and their impact on gameplay, which is relevant to the discussion. It invites constructive dialogue by asking for common ground on what constitutes a bug versus an exploit. While it is somewhat generic, it is still natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
