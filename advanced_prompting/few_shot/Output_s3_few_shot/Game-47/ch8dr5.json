        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument about market pressure and broader appeal is more defensible than the blanket accusations of corporate greed and SJW ideology. It acknowledges the complexity of the situation and provides a balanced perspective, which is fair and neutral. However, it does not fully engage with the specific arguments made in the conversation, such as the concerns about EA's influence and the role of SJW culture. This makes it slightly less nuanced than a 5, but still a strong judgment.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant, encouraging a more nuanced discussion about CDPR's motivations and the broader context of the gaming industry. It acknowledges the complexity of the situation and invites a constructive dialogue. While it is somewhat generic and could sound a bit like an AI, it is still reasonably natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
