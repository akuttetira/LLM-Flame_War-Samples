        "rationale": "The mediation incorrectly assigns the 'right' to the person expressing frustration with Bloodborne's design, while dismissing the other person's criticism of their attitude. This is unfair and does not accurately reflect the complexity of the discussion. The mediation fails to acknowledge the valid points made about game design while also not properly addressing the dismissive tone. This fits a low score as it is clearly wrong about who is more in the right and lacks proper support.",

    "steering_score": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is conciliatory and relevant, encouraging participants to focus on shared experiences rather than getting defensive. It shifts the conversation toward constructive dialogue by suggesting sharing favorite parts or strategies. While it is somewhat generic, it is still natural and has a good chance of guiding positive dialogue. This aligns well with a score of 4.",
