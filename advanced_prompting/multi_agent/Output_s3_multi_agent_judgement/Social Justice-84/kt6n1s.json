        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the situation, recognizing that not all Trump supporters were violent and that the Capitol invasion was not necessarily a peaceful protest. It also highlights the importance of not making blanket claims about a group, which is a balanced and fair approach. The reasoning is thoughtful and considers multiple perspectives without taking an extreme stance.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance the arguments but fails to adequately address the core issues. It does not clearly condemn the hate speech or the promotion of violence, which are central to the /r/AgainstHateSubreddits rules. The judgment is somewhat neutral but lacks the necessary critical evaluation of the harmful content and the justification for the ban. The mediation also does not clearly state that the user's actions were in violation of the subreddit's rules, which is essential for a fair and effective judgment.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced view by acknowledging the complexity of the situation and the difference between individual actions and group labels. It correctly notes that not all Trump supporters were violent and that the Capitol invasion was not necessarily a peaceful protest. However, it could have done more to address the specific violations of subreddit rules related to hate speech and the promotion of violence. The score reflects a fair assessment that the mediation is thoughtful but could be more explicit in its condemnation of the harmful content.",
