    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that using a racial slur as a substitute is a form of hate speech and should be condemned. The reasoning acknowledges the serious nature of the issue and the importance of addressing it directly, rather than deflecting or mocking. The judgement is fair and effective in highlighting the more justified argument.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation output fails to address the specific context of the conversation, which revolves around a Reddit user's attempt to use 'jogger' as a racial slur and the subsequent backlash. The judgment is overly broad and does not engage with the nuanced arguments presented, such as the use of private messages to avoid public confrontation and the discussion around banning subreddits. The mediation also does not adequately consider the potential for misinterpretation or the role of online discourse in shaping racial terminology.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively addresses the core issue of using a racial slur as a substitute and highlights the importance of condemning hate speech. However, it could have provided a more nuanced analysis of the online discourse context, such as the role of private messages and subreddit banning. The score reflects a balance between the valid condemnation of hate speech and the need for a more detailed examination of the specific online context.",
