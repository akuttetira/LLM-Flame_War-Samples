    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the complexity of the situation by recognizing the societal change argument as more defensible. It addresses the critique of a blanket claim about Elliot Page's motivation while highlighting the broader context of societal shifts in gender roles. This shows a balanced and nuanced understanding of the discussion.",
        "score": 5
    },
    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance two perspectives but fails to adequately address the core issue of hate and misinformation in the comment section. It does not clearly condemn the hate-filled rants or the use of misogynistic slurs, and it does not fully support the argument that Elliot Page's coming out is for attention. The judgment is somewhat neutral but lacks the necessary critique of the harmful rhetoric present in the conversation.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced perspective by acknowledging the societal change argument as more defensible while addressing the critique of the blanket claim about Elliot Page's motivation. However, it could have done more to condemn the hate-filled rhetoric and misogynistic slurs present in the conversation. The score reflects a reasonable balance between acknowledging valid points and the need for stronger criticism of harmful content.",
