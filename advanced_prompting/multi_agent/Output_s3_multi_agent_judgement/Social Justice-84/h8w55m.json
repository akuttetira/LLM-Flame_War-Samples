    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the situation and the lack of conclusive evidence, which is a balanced approach. It avoids making definitive claims about lynching while recognizing the possibility of foul play. The response is neutral and does not take a side, which is appropriate given the lack of clear evidence. However, it could have been more specific in addressing the arguments presented.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation output fails to decisively determine which side is correct, instead presenting a balanced view that lacks concrete judgment. It does not address the specific arguments or evidence presented by either side, nor does it provide a clear conclusion. The discussion is complex, and the mediation does not adequately evaluate the claims of lynching versus the possibility of other explanations, such as suicide or coercion. As a result, the mediation is overly neutral and does not fulfill the requirement of providing a judgment on which side is correct.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced view by acknowledging the complexity of the situation and the lack of conclusive evidence. It correctly notes that the discussion is more nuanced than blanket claims of lynching. However, it could have done more to address specific arguments and evidence presented, such as the possibility of drugs rendering victims unconscious or the role of coercion. The mediation avoids taking a definitive stance but could have offered a more thorough evaluation of the claims made by both sides.",
