    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the issue by recognizing that the spread of misinformation can be understood as a result of people seeking to reject established norms, which is a more nuanced perspective than a simplistic blame on rioting. It also references the concept of 'normality' and societal bias, which are relevant to the discussion. The response is fair, balanced, and does not take a clear side but instead highlights the depth of the argument.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation output fails to adequately address the original claim that R/AltRightChristian is spreading fake news about George Floyd's death. It also does not clearly determine which side is correct in the debate, instead offering a vague acknowledgment of nuance. The response lacks a clear judgment and fails to engage with the specific arguments presented in the conversation.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the complexity of the issue by addressing the nuance in the argument about misinformation and societal bias. It does not take a clear side but instead provides a balanced perspective that engages with the concepts of normality and societal bias. However, it could have more directly addressed the original claim about the spread of fake news. Overall, it strikes a good balance between fairness and engagement with the arguments presented.",
