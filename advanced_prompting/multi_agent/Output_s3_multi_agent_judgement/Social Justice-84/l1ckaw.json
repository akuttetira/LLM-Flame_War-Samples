    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the situation by recognizing that the original poster's friend may have been temporarily affected by the sub's toxic environment, which is a nuanced and fair assessment. It also highlights the importance of not making blanket judgments about the sub as a whole, which shows understanding of the context and the potential for individual variation in experiences. This approach is balanced and avoids oversimplification.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation output fails to address the core issues raised in the conversation. It does not clearly determine which side is correct in the debate about the subreddits and their content. The output is vague and does not provide a clear judgment on the validity of the claims made about the subreddits being neo-nazi or anti-Semitic. It also does not adequately address the personal story of the friend and the concern about the impact of the sub on individuals. The judgment is too neutral and lacks the necessary depth to resolve the conflict effectively.",

        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced view by acknowledging the complexity of the situation, recognizing that the original poster's friend may have been temporarily affected by the sub's toxic environment, and avoiding a blanket judgment about the sub as a whole. It also addresses the nuances of the discussion without oversimplifying the issues. However, it does not fully engage with the specific claims about the sub being neo-nazi or anti-Semitic, which are central to the original argument. The score reflects a fair assessment of the mediation's strengths and limitations.",
