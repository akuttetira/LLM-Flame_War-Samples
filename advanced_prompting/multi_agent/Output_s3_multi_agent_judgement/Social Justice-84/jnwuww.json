        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the issue by recognizing that the post could be a bad attempt at humor rather than genuine racism. This approach is fair and considers the nuances of the discussion, allowing for a balanced perspective. It does not outright dismiss the post as hate speech but also does not fully validate it as humor. The reasoning is thoughtful and allows for the possibility of different interpretations.",

        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance the argument that the post could be a bad attempt at humor versus hate speech, but it fails to adequately address the core issue of racial slurs and their inherent racism. The judgment leans towards the 'bad attempt at humor' side, which is insufficient given the presence of a racial slur and the context of the subreddit. The mediation does not clearly condemn the post as hate speech, which is necessary given the content.",
