        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the complexity of the issue, recognizing that social media platforms have a responsibility to limit hate speech and protect vulnerable groups. It also correctly points out that the 'censorship can only be done by the government' argument is flawed, as social media platforms do have significant power and influence. The reasoning is balanced and acknowledges the need for limiting harmful speech while also recognizing the limitations of the First Amendment.",

        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the issue but leans towards the argument that social media platforms should limit hate speech. However, it fails to adequately address the nuances of free speech, the role of government in censorship, and the potential for abuse by powerful entities. The judgment is somewhat one-sided and does not fully consider the counterarguments about the limits of free speech and the responsibility of platforms.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively addresses the core issue by recognizing the responsibility of social media platforms to limit hate speech and protect vulnerable groups, while also acknowledging the limitations of the First Amendment. It correctly identifies the flaw in the 'censorship can only be done by the government' argument and balances the discussion between the need for limiting harmful speech and the role of government in censorship. The reasoning is well-reasoned and provides a nuanced perspective.",
