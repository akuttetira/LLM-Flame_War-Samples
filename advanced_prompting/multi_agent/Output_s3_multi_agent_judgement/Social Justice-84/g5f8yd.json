    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the debate around non-binary identity and recognizes the defensibility of the argument that non-binary individuals are not 'fakes.' It provides a balanced perspective by not taking a definitive side but instead highlighting the merits of one argument over the other. This approach reflects a fair and neutral evaluation of the discussion, which is important in a sensitive and polarized topic.",

    },
    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation fails to adequately address the core issues of identity gatekeeping and the harmful implications of labeling individuals as 'bad actors' or 'fakes' based on subjective criteria. It also overlooks the problematic nature of the comments that reduce non-binary identities to performative acts, which can be discriminatory and exclusionary. The judgment is too vague and does not clearly establish which side is more correct in the context of the discussion.",

        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the debate around non-binary identity and recognizes the defensibility of the argument that non-binary individuals are not 'fakes.' It provides a balanced perspective by not taking a definitive side but instead highlighting the merits of one argument over the other. However, it could have done more to address the harmful implications of labeling individuals as 'bad actors' or 'fakes' based on subjective criteria, which is a critical issue in the discussion. The score reflects a fair assessment that acknowledges the mediation's strengths while noting its limitations in addressing the core concerns.",
