        "rationale": "The mediation fails to adequately address the potential insensitivity of the meme, which could be seen as trivializing a serious issue. It also does not fully consider the context of the original conversation, where the discussion revolves around the appropriateness of memes related to George Floyd's death. The judgment leans towards one side without fully acknowledging the complexities and potential harm of the content.",
