    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the issue, recognizing that social media companies have a responsibility to moderate content while also considering the practical challenges they face. It provides a balanced view by acknowledging the validity of concerns about hate speech and the limitations of current legal frameworks, rather than taking an extreme position. This approach is more nuanced and fair compared to a one-sided judgment.",

        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the issue and presents a balanced view by recognizing both the responsibility of social media companies and the critique of their actions. However, it fails to fully address the negative bias towards the argument that social media companies are inherently evil. The score is moderate as the mediation provides a nuanced perspective but does not clearly favor one side over the other in a way that aligns with the negative bias requirement.",
