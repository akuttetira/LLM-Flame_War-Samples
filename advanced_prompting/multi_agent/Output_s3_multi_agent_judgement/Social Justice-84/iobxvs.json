        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the situation and provides a balanced perspective by recognizing the argument about purging left-wing spaces as more compelling. It avoids taking a definitive side and instead focuses on the reasoning behind the arguments presented, which is a fair and effective approach.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation fails to adequately address the core issue of whether the actions were a purge of left-wing spaces or a necessary step to maintain community standards. It leans towards the latter but does not provide sufficient evidence or reasoning to support this conclusion. The argument is somewhat biased towards the idea that the actions were not a purge, without clearly countering the evidence presented by the users who claim it was. This lack of balanced analysis weakens the mediation's fairness and effectiveness.",

It does not take a definitive side but instead focuses on the reasoning behind the arguments, which is a fair approach. However, it could have provided more specific context or evidence to support its conclusion, which would have strengthened its effectiveness.",
