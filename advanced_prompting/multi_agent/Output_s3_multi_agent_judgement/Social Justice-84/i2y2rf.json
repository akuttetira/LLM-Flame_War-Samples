    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the arguments presented, recognizing that the far right's use of cognitive dissonance as a tool to silence others is a valid point. It also correctly identifies the far right's 'religionization' of politics as a key factor in their success. The judgment is nuanced and does not oversimplify the issue, which is important given the polarized nature of the discussion.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance the discussion by acknowledging the far right's use of cognitive dissonance as a tool, but it fails to address the validity of the claims made by the far right and the broader issues of political polarization. The mediation also does not adequately challenge the blanket accusations against the left, which can be seen as dismissive and not fully neutral. The score is lower due to the lack of critical examination of the far right's arguments and the failure to provide a balanced perspective.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the complexity of the arguments, recognizing the far right's use of cognitive dissonance as a tool to silence others and the 'religionization' of politics. It provides a balanced perspective without oversimplifying the issue, which is crucial in a polarized discussion. However, it could have done more to address the validity of the far right's claims and the broader implications of political polarization.",
