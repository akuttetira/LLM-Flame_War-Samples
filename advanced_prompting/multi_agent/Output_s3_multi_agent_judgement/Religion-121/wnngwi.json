    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the validity of the arguments against child marriage and the Prophet's actions, which is a positive aspect. It recognizes the moral concerns raised by the other party, showing a balanced approach. However, it could have been more nuanced in addressing the cultural relativism argument and the complexity of historical context. The score reflects the recognition of the stronger moral argument against child marriage and the Prophet's actions, while also noting the need for more depth in the discussion.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges that the person questioning the morality of child marriage and the Prophet's actions is more in the right. However, it fails to address the critical flaw in reasoning that cultural relativism does not justify morally unacceptable actions. The mediation also overlooks the fact that the person defending the Prophet's actions uses a biased and selective interpretation of religious texts and historical context, which is a significant flaw in their argument. The mediation does not adequately consider the ethical implications of child marriage and the potential for cultural relativism to be misused to justify harmful practices.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the person questioning the morality of child marriage and the Prophet's actions presents a stronger moral argument. However, it fails to adequately address the critical issue of cultural relativism and the ethical implications of justifying harmful practices based on historical context. The mediation also does not sufficiently challenge the selective interpretation of religious texts by the defending party. The score reflects the recognition of the stronger moral argument but also the need for a more comprehensive evaluation of the cultural and ethical dimensions of the debate.",
