    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the issue, recognizing that the medicalization of gender dysphoria is a contentious topic with valid concerns from both sides. It provides a balanced perspective by stating that the person advocating for the medicalization of gender dysphoria is more in the right than those who dismiss the issue without considering the harm caused by societal norms. This reflects a nuanced understanding of the debate, acknowledging the potential harm of forced conformity while not dismissing the concerns of those who believe in the medical approach.",

    },
    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation output incorrectly asserts that the person claiming the medicalization of gender dysphoria is child abuse is more right. The argument fails to address the complexity of gender dysphoria, the role of medical professionals, and the ethical considerations involved. It also overlooks the diversity of opinions and the lack of consensus on the topic. The judgment is not based on a thorough examination of the arguments presented but rather on a biased interpretation of the issue.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance the debate by acknowledging the complexity of the issue and the potential harm of forced conformity to societal norms. However, it oversimplifies the argument by asserting that one side is more right without thoroughly addressing the nuances of gender dysphoria, medicalization, and the ethical considerations involved. The score is moderate as the mediation shows some awareness of the complexity but lacks depth in evaluating the arguments presented.",
