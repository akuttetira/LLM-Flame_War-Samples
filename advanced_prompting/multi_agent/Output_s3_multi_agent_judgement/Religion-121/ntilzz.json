        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges that the person pointing out flaws in the argument for a universally accepted Bible is more correct, but it doesn't fully address the negative bias. The response fails to properly critique the other side's arguments and doesn't clearly demonstrate why the opposing side is wrong. The mediation also doesn't provide a thorough analysis of the arguments, making it somewhat superficial.",
