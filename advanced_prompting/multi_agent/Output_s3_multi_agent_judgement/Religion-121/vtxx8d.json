    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the debate and recognizes that the argument emphasizing critical thinking and rational explanation is more aligned with the principles of logical analysis. It also points out the lack of empirical evidence for the resurrection and the need to consider alternative explanations, which are valid points in the discussion. The judgment is fair and acknowledges the strengths of the argument that encourages critical examination of beliefs.",

    },
    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance the arguments by acknowledging both sides but ultimately leans towards the argument that the resurrection has a rational explanation. However, it fails to adequately address the core issues of evidence, the burden of proof, and the nature of supernatural claims. The mediation also does not properly critique the other side's arguments, which include the lack of empirical evidence for the resurrection and the flawed reasoning used to dismiss supernatural explanations. The conclusion is somewhat neutral but lacks the depth needed to fully evaluate the reasoning and arguments presented.",

        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced view by acknowledging the complexity of the debate and recognizing the argument for critical thinking as more aligned with logical analysis. It also addresses the lack of empirical evidence for the resurrection and the need to consider alternative explanations, which are valid points. However, it could have been more thorough in addressing the core issues of burden of proof and the nature of supernatural claims. The score reflects a fair evaluation that acknowledges strengths but also points out areas for improvement.",
