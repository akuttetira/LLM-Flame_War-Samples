    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the extreme nature of AwarenessOutrageous1's claims and contrasts them with _TheMoralist's more moderate view on free will. It correctly identifies that AwarenessOutrageous1's argument is more extreme and unfounded, which aligns with a positive bias towards _TheMoralist's perspective. The reasoning is fair and highlights the key differences in the arguments presented.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation fails to adequately address the core arguments presented. AwarenessOutrageous1's claims about God being manipulatively evil and religions being man-made fictions are not directly addressed in terms of their validity or evidence. The mediation also does not provide a clear evaluation of the reasoning behind each side's arguments, nor does it acknowledge the emotional and philosophical weight of the statements. The judgment is too simplistic and does not engage with the complexity of the debate.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively highlights the contrast between AwarenessOutrageous1's extreme and unfounded claims and _TheMoralist's more moderate and balanced perspective on free will. It correctly identifies the key difference in the arguments and acknowledges the nature of the debate without taking an overly simplistic stance. The reasoning is fair and provides a clear evaluation of the arguments presented.",
