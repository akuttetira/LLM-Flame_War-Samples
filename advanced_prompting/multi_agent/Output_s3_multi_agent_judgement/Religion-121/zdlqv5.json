It also highlights that not all parental influence is inherently negative, which shows a balanced understanding of the issue.

        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges that teaching children one's beliefs is a form of raising them, which is a fair point. However, it fails to adequately address the concerns raised about the potential for harmful indoctrination, especially when parents impose their beliefs without allowing children to critically engage with them. The mediation also doesn't clearly determine which side is more correct, leading to a lack of decisive judgment.",
