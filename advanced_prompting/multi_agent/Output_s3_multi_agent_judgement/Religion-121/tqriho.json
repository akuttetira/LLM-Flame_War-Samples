        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the argument and the flawed logic on both sides. It correctly identifies that the side questioning God's love and morality presents more coherent arguments and highlights the misinterpretations of biblical texts by the other side. The judgment leans towards the side that questions God's love and morality, which is a fair assessment given the context of the discussion.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation incorrectly claims that the people questioning God's love and morality are more right than the one claiming God is perfect. The argument is complex and involves multiple perspectives, with both sides presenting valid points and misinterpretations. The mediation fails to adequately address the nuances of the debate and the potential for subjective interpretations of religious texts. It also oversimplifies the discussion by suggesting one side is more correct than the other without sufficient evidence or analysis.",

        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to evaluate the arguments but fails to adequately address the nuanced and complex nature of the debate. While the side questioning God's love and morality does present coherent arguments and highlights misinterpretations, the other side also raises valid points about the nature of God and the limitations of human understanding. The mediation oversimplifies the discussion by suggesting one side is more correct than the other without sufficient analysis of the religious texts and the context of the debate.",
