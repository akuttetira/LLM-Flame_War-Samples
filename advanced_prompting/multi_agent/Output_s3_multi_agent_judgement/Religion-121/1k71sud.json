        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the discussion around a unified Islamic state and the role of nationalism, which shows an understanding of the nuances in the conversation. It avoids taking a simplistic stance and instead highlights the need for a more nuanced perspective, which is a positive aspect of the mediation.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation fails to address the core issues presented in the conversation. It presents a vague and overly optimistic view of a khilafa without acknowledging the complex historical, political, and social realities of the situation. The discussion includes valid concerns about nationalism and its role in conflict, but the mediation does not clearly determine which side is correct or provide a balanced analysis of the arguments. It also lacks concrete reasoning and fails to engage with the specific points made by the participants.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the complexity of the discussion around a unified Islamic state (khilafa) and the role of nationalism, which is a positive aspect. It avoids taking a simplistic stance and instead highlights the need for a more nuanced perspective. However, it does not fully engage with the specific arguments presented, such as the potential for a khilafa to function as a union of Muslim countries rather than the elimination of nations, or the historical and political realities of the situation. The mediation is somewhat vague in its approach and does not provide a clear resolution or balanced analysis of the arguments.",
