    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of interpreting Jesus' teachings and recognizes the value of personal experience in understanding them. It also addresses the critique of relying solely on scripture, which is a fair and balanced approach. The judgment is not outright dismissive of one side but acknowledges the merits of considering multiple perspectives, which shows a reasonable attempt to evaluate the arguments presented.",
        "score": 4
    },
    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation fails to address the core issues of the argument. It does not correctly evaluate the reasoning or arguments presented. The mediation suggests that one side is more correct than the other without providing a clear, evidence-based justification. It also overlooks the logical inconsistencies and lack of empirical support for the claims made by the argument that Jesus' teachings are open to interpretation through personal experience. The mediation is overly simplistic and does not engage with the complexities of the debate.",

    },
    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced view by acknowledging the complexity of interpreting Jesus' teachings and the role of personal experience. However, it oversimplifies the debate by not adequately addressing the historical and textual evidence presented, such as the authenticity of Jesus' teachings and the reliability of the Bible. While it recognizes the value of multiple perspectives, it fails to critically evaluate the arguments regarding the historical context and the nature of religious claims. The score reflects a moderate assessment, as the mediation is somewhat balanced but lacks depth in addressing the key points of contention.",
