    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument acknowledging moral accountability is more aligned with Christian doctrine, as it recognizes the idea of judgment based on actions. The reasoning acknowledges the possibility of punishment for wrongdoing, which is a key aspect of Christian teachings. The score reflects the accuracy of the judgment in aligning with the core theological perspective of moral responsibility.",

    },
    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation incorrectly claims that the argument for hell as a place of punishment for 'as-holes' is more correct than the one dismissing eternal suffering. This overlooks the fundamental disagreement over the nature of hell and the moral implications of eternal suffering. The mediation fails to acknowledge the complexity of the debate and the potential for both sides to have valid points within their theological frameworks. It also ignores the emotional and ethical concerns raised by the other side regarding the treatment of loved ones and the nature of divine justice.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a reasonable assessment by acknowledging the argument for moral accountability as more in line with Christian doctrine, which does emphasize judgment based on actions. However, it oversimplifies the complex theological and ethical debate around hell, eternal suffering, and the nature of divine justice. The mediation does not adequately address the emotional and ethical concerns raised by the other side regarding the treatment of loved ones and the implications of eternal punishment. The score reflects a balanced view that acknowledges the mediation's strengths but also points out its limitations in fully addressing the nuanced debate.",
