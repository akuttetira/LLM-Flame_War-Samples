    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the nuanced discussion around the definition of faith and the distinction between faith based on evidence and blind faith. It correctly identifies that the debate is complex and that the definition of faith significantly impacts the argument. The mediation recognizes that faith can be useful when based on evidence, which aligns with the arguments presented by participants like thrww3534. It also acknowledges the opposing view that faith without evidence is unreliable, as argued by L0nga. The mediation provides a balanced assessment that reflects the complexity of the discussion and the validity of both perspectives.",

        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the debate around faith and evidence, recognizing that faith can be based on evidence and thus not inherently useless. However, it does not fully address the core arguments presented, such as the dictionary definitions and the distinction between different types of faith. The mediation leans towards a balanced view but fails to decisively evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each side's arguments, particularly the claim that faith is inherently useless for finding truth. The score reflects a moderate evaluation of the mediation's ability to fairly and effectively assess the arguments presented.",
