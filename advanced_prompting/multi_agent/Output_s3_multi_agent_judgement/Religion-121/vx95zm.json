    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the discussion around supernatural phenomena and the nuances in definitions, which is a positive aspect. It recognizes that the debate is not a simple binary but involves deeper considerations of definitions and scientific understanding. However, it does not clearly determine which side is correct in the argument, which is necessary for a mediation output. The score reflects the balance between acknowledging the complexity and the need for a clear determination of correctness.",
