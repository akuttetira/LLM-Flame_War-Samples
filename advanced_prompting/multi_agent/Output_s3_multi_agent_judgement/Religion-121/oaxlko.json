    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the argument regarding the burden of proof and the nature of theistic claims. It correctly identifies that the burden of proof is a key issue in debates about theism, and that dismissing theism as unprovable is too simplistic. The judgment is fair and balanced, recognizing the nuances in the discussion without taking a clear side. The reasoning is sound and acknowledges the difficulty of proving supernatural claims through logic alone.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the burden of proof argument but fails to adequately address the flaws in the opposing side's reasoning. The response is somewhat neutral but does not fully engage with the complexities of the debate, such as the subjective nature of religious experience and the philosophical implications of proof in metaphysical claims. It also does not clearly establish why the burden of proof is more sound than the blanket dismissal of theism.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the complexity of the burden of proof argument and the difficulty of proving supernatural claims through logic alone. It correctly identifies that dismissing theism as unprovable is too simplistic and recognizes the nuances in the discussion. However, it could have provided a more detailed explanation of why the burden of proof is more sound than the blanket dismissal of theism, which would have strengthened the argument.",
