    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the argument, recognizing that the claim about Aisha's age is based on presentist interpretations and selective historical evidence. It also notes that the argument is more flawed than the claim that the marriage was to a minor. The mediation provides a balanced view, highlighting the issues with the argument's methodology while also addressing the other side's claims. The reasoning is fair and considers the historical context and the use of evidence.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance the argument by acknowledging the flaws in both sides but ultimately favors the claim that Muhammad's marriage to Aisha was not a marriage to a minor. However, the reasoning is somewhat vague and does not thoroughly address the historical, cultural, and evidential complexities of the issue. The mediation fails to clearly establish why the presentist interpretation is more flawed than the claim of a minor, and it does not adequately engage with the historical context and the evidence presented by both sides. The score is moderate because the mediation attempts to be balanced but lacks the depth and clarity needed to fully justify its conclusion.",
