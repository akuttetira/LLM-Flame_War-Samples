    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the argument regarding divine justification for child suffering, recognizing that the claim of divine intervention as a valid justification is more problematic. This shows an understanding of the nuanced debate between theistic and secular perspectives on suffering. The score reflects the ability to evaluate the arguments presented and recognize the deeper issues in the theistic justification.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation fails to address the core issue of whether divine justification for child suffering is valid or not. It simply states that one argument is more problematic than the other without providing a clear reasoning or evaluation of the arguments presented. The mediation does not adequately consider the nuances of the debate, such as the ethical implications of suffering for the sake of spiritual growth, the role of free will, or the moral responsibility of believers. The response is vague and lacks a critical analysis of the arguments, making it unsatisfactory as a judgment.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the debate around divine justification for child suffering, recognizing that the theistic argument is more problematic. It provides a balanced view by highlighting the ethical concerns associated with justifying child suffering, which is a key aspect of the discussion. However, it could have offered more detailed reasoning or context to fully address the nuances of the arguments. The score reflects a fair evaluation of the mediation's ability to recognize the deeper issues in the theistic justification.",
