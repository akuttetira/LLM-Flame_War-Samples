It recognizes that both sides have valid points, showing a balanced approach. However, it does not clearly determine which side is correct, which is necessary for a fair judgment. The mediation is neutral and avoids taking a definitive stance on the theological debate, which is appropriate given the sensitive nature of the topic.",
