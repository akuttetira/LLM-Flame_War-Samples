    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the 'aboutness' argument and the difficulty in explaining intentionality in purely physical terms. It also recognizes that the mind's relationship with the body is more nuanced than a simple physical reduction. The judgment is balanced, highlighting the strengths of both sides without taking an extreme stance. The reasoning is thoughtful and considers the philosophical and scientific nuances of the debate.",

    },
    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges that the argument for intentionality being non-physical is more defensible, which is a nuanced and balanced view. However, it does not fully address the complexities of the debate, such as the role of physical processes in explaining intentionality, the fallacy of composition, and the distinction between physical and non-physical properties. The score is moderate because the mediation provides a reasonable balance but could have been more thorough in evaluating the arguments.",

It provides a balanced perspective by recognizing the strengths of both sides without taking an extreme stance.
