    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument for fetal rights is more defensible, as it acknowledges the complexity of the issue and the lack of consensus on when life begins. It also recognizes the opposing view's stance on bodily autonomy but finds the state enforcing a ban on abortions for any reason less justifiable. The reasoning is fair, neutral, and acknowledges the nuances of the debate.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation's conclusion is somewhat biased towards the pro-life perspective, which is not neutral. It fails to adequately address the complexity of the debate, particularly the ethical and legal considerations surrounding abortion. The mediation also overlooks the argument that the state should not enforce personal beliefs on individuals, which is a key point in the pro-choice stance. The reasoning is not fully balanced and does not consider the nuances of both sides' arguments.",

        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced assessment of the debate, acknowledging the complexity of the issue and the lack of consensus on fetal rights. It correctly identifies that the argument for fetal rights is more defensible, while also recognizing the opposing view's stance on bodily autonomy. However, it could have done more to address the ethical and legal considerations surrounding abortion and the role of the state in enforcing personal beliefs. The reasoning is generally fair and neutral but could be more comprehensive.",
