        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the discussion involves complex theological arguments and personal attacks. The person engaging with Christian theology and the trinity provides detailed reasoning and references to biblical texts, while the other participant resorts to personal attacks and refuses to engage constructively. The mediation acknowledges the depth of theological discussion and the need for respectful dialogue, which is fair and effective.",
