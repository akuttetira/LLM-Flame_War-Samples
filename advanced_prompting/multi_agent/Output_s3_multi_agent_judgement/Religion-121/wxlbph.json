    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the scientific argument regarding lactose intolerance and the historical context of milk consumption, which are key points in the discussion. It also recognizes the complexity of interpreting religious texts in light of modern scientific understanding. The judgment is balanced, giving credit to the scientific perspective while not outright dismissing the religious text's authority. This shows a nuanced understanding of the debate and a fair evaluation of both sides.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges that the argument against the Quran's advice on milk is more defensible, which is a fair assessment. However, it fails to fully address the nuances of the debate, such as the linguistic interpretation of the verse, the historical context of milk consumption, and the scientific validity of the claims. The mediation also does not adequately consider the religious perspective that the Quran is infallible and that the advice is meant for those who can consume it. The score is moderate as the mediation provides a balanced view but lacks depth in addressing the key points of contention.",

        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced view by acknowledging the scientific argument regarding lactose intolerance and the historical context of milk consumption, while also recognizing the religious text's authority. However, it could have delved deeper into the linguistic interpretation of the verse and the nuances of the debate surrounding the Quran's infallibility. The score reflects a fair assessment that acknowledges the scientific perspective but also respects the religious context.",
