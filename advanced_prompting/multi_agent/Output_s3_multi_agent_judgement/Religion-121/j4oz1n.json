    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the analysis of audio and video frame by frame by users like 'ursaemusic' and 'zerosuitsalmon' provides strong evidence of editing. These users pointed out specific technical aspects like audio cuts and reflections in the video that clearly indicate manipulation. The mediation also acknowledges the debate around morph cuts but emphasizes that the evidence supports the conclusion that the video was edited, which is a fair and balanced assessment.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation suggests that those analyzing the video frame by frame and pointing out the audio cut are more correct than those dismissing it as a morph cut without evidence. However, the mediation fails to address the complexity of the issue, including the possibility of a genuine medical condition, the technical aspects of video editing, and the context of the video's origin. It also does not adequately consider the arguments from both sides, leading to a biased conclusion that leans towards the analysis of the video rather than a balanced evaluation.",

        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced assessment by acknowledging the technical evidence from users like 'ursaemusic' and 'zerosuitsalmon' that supports the conclusion of video editing. However, it also recognizes the debate around morph cuts and does not fully address the complexity of the issue, including the possibility of a genuine medical condition. The score reflects a fair evaluation that acknowledges both sides of the argument but leans slightly towards the technical evidence.",
