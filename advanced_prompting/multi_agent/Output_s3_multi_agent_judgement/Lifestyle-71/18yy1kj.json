    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the issue, recognizing that both perspectives have merit. The argument that giving flowers can be seen as trivializing the experience is valid, but the mediation also notes that the alternative perspective of dismissing the gesture as traumatic or unnecessary is less nuanced. The mediation shows a balanced view by acknowledging the value of thoughtful gestures while also highlighting the potential for overreaction.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation suggests that those questioning the value of giving flowers are more correct, but this overlooks the valid concerns of both sides. The argument that periods are a normal, non-event is reasonable, but the counterpoint that periods can be traumatic for some children is also valid. The mediation fails to adequately address the nuanced perspectives presented, such as the cultural context and the individual experiences of the child. It also dismisses the emotional support aspect without fully acknowledging the potential for trauma.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced view by acknowledging that both perspectives have merit, but it leans more towards the side that questions the value of giving flowers. While it correctly identifies that periods can be a normal, non-event, it fails to fully address the emotional support aspect and the potential for trauma in some children. The score is moderate as the mediation attempts to balance the arguments but does not fully capture the nuanced perspectives presented.",
