        "rationale": "The mediation correctly acknowledges the complexity of the situation, recognizing the validity of the person's experience with a narcissistic mother and the importance of their doctor's validation. However, it could have been more nuanced in addressing the concerns raised by others, such as the potential for misinterpretation or the importance of professional boundaries. The judgment leans towards the person sharing their experience, which is fair, but could have been more balanced in considering the perspectives of those who raised concerns about the doctor's comments.",
