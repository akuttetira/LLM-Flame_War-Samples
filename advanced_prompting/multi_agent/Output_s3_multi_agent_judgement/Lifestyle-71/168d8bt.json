        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the primary concern is the child's safety and the parents' behavior, which are more significant issues than the personal attacks and inflammatory comments. The judgment reflects a focus on the serious implications of the parents' actions and the potential danger to the child, which aligns with a fair and neutral evaluation of the situation.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the concern for the child's safety and criticizes the personal attacks, which is a positive point. However, it fails to address the underlying issues of the parents' behavior and the potential harm caused by the husband's actions. The mediation is somewhat neutral but lacks depth in evaluating the severity of the situation and the responsibility of the parents. It also does not adequately address the emotional impact on the daughter's friend and the broader implications of the parents' actions.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively highlights the primary concern of the child's safety and the parents' harmful behavior, while appropriately addressing the need to limit personal attacks. It strikes a balance between acknowledging the serious nature of the situation and maintaining a neutral tone. The positive rationale is well-supported, and while the negative rationale raises valid points about depth, the mediation as a whole is fair, effective, and focused on the key issues.",
