    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of processing childhood trauma and recognizes the importance of both healing and validation. It provides a balanced perspective that respects the emotional journey of individuals while also upholding the guidelines of a support forum. This approach is fair, nuanced, and considers the context of abuse without normalizing harmful behaviors.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation output fails to address the specific context of abuse and the importance of not normalizing or validating abusive behavior. It overly generalizes the discussion without considering the potential harm of invalidating experiences, which is a key concern in the original conversation. The judgment is not neutral and shows a bias towards a more empathetic approach without properly evaluating the risks of normalizing abuse.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation offers a balanced perspective that acknowledges the complexity of processing childhood trauma while also respecting the guidelines of a support forum. It recognizes the importance of healing and validation without normalizing abusive behavior, which aligns with the positive rationale. However, it does not explicitly address the need to avoid invalidating experiences, which is a key concern in the original conversation. The score reflects a middle ground between the two rationales, acknowledging the mediation's strengths while noting its limitations.",
