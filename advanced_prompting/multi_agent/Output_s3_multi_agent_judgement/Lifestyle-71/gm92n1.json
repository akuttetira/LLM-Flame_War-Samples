    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies the side that advocates for leaving a toxic relationship and prioritizing one's well-being as the more just and reasonable position. The arguments presented by this side emphasize the importance of self-respect, the harmful effects of toxic relationships, and the invalidation of the idea that victims should remain in abusive situations. The reasoning is sound and aligns with the principles of healthy relationships and personal autonomy.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument advocating for leaving a toxic relationship is more aligned with the principles of self-respect and safety. However, the judgment could be more nuanced. While the mediation is generally fair, it oversimplifies the complexity of the situation by not adequately addressing the potential for misinterpretation of the original conversation. Some comments, like the deleted ones, may have been context-dependent, and the mediation does not fully account for the possibility of miscommunication or differing perspectives. The judgment is mostly correct but could be more balanced in its analysis.",

        "rationale": "The mediation accurately identifies the side advocating for leaving a toxic relationship and prioritizing self-respect as the more just position. It correctly highlights the invalidation of the idea that victims should remain in abusive situations, which is crucial in this context. However, the mediation could have been more nuanced by acknowledging the complexity of the original conversation and the potential for context-dependent interpretations, as noted in the negative judge's response. The score reflects a balanced assessment of the mediation's accuracy and its need for greater nuance.",
