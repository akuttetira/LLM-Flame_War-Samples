    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the value of emotional gestures like hugs and recognizes the potential meaning behind the 'I love you' phrase, which aligns with the original conversation's themes of emotional connection and vulnerability. It also critiques the dismissive attitude towards emotional expression, which is fair and reflective of the discussion. The reasoning is thoughtful and considers the emotional context of the conversation.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation incorrectly assumes that a hug is more effective than a simple 'I love you' statement. It also dismisses the 'I love you' as 'weirdo' without considering the context or the emotional intent behind the statement. The judgment shows a bias towards physical gestures over verbal expressions of affection, which may not be fair or neutral.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced view by acknowledging the value of both emotional gestures and the potential meaning behind the 'I love you' phrase. It correctly identifies the dismissive attitude towards emotional expression as problematic, which aligns with the conversation's themes. However, it slightly oversimplifies the complexity of emotional communication by prioritizing hugs over verbal expressions. The reasoning is generally fair and considers the emotional context, but could be more neutral in its assessment.",
