    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that prioritizing personal success and happiness over revenge is the more constructive approach. The arguments supporting this view highlight the importance of self-worth, resilience, and moving forward without being defined by past trauma. The reasoning is sound, and the judgment aligns with the positive bias by emphasizing growth and self-actualization over retribution.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation incorrectly assumes that advocating for personal success and happiness is inherently more right than seeking revenge or validation. The conversation includes valid points about the importance of personal success and self-worth, but it also acknowledges the complexity of dealing with toxic family dynamics. The mediation overlooks the emotional and psychological toll of not seeking revenge, and fails to recognize that some individuals may feel the need to assert their independence through more direct means. The judgment is overly simplistic and does not fully account for the nuanced perspectives presented.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced view by recognizing the value of personal success and happiness while acknowledging the complexity of dealing with toxic family dynamics. It correctly identifies that prioritizing self-worth and growth is a more constructive approach than revenge. However, it could have been more nuanced in addressing the emotional and psychological aspects of the situation. The score reflects a fair assessment of the mediation's strengths and limitations.",
