        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the person who connected their personal experience to a broader cultural issue is more justified in their perspective. The other party dismissed the original concern as dramatic, which is not supportive. The mediation acknowledges the validity of the emotional impact of being invalidated by a parent and the cultural context of materialism, which are key points in the discussion.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance the perspectives but fails to fully address the negative bias. It acknowledges the person's personal experience and the broader cultural issue, but does not sufficiently critique the dismissive response. The mediation leans towards the person who connects personal experience to cultural issues, which may not be the most neutral or fair assessment given the context of the conversation.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the validity of the person's personal experience and the cultural context of materialism, while also pointing out the dismissive nature of the other party's response. It provides a balanced assessment by recognizing the emotional impact of being invalidated by a parent and the broader societal issues at play. However, it could have been more neutral in its conclusion by not clearly favoring one perspective over the other.",
