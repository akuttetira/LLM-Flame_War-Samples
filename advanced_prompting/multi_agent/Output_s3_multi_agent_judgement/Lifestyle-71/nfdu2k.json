        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the importance of individual autonomy in health decisions and recognizes the validity of differing opinions about vaccines. It highlights the right to make informed choices and the importance of respecting others' views, which is a fair and balanced approach. The judgment does not take a definitive stance on the correctness of vaccine policies but emphasizes the value of open dialogue and respect for diverse perspectives.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation output fails to address the core issue of the conversation, which revolves around family dynamics, personal autonomy, and the role of misinformation. It generalizes the debate without acknowledging the specific context of the participants' experiences, such as the impact of parental influence and the emotional toll of standing up to antivaxx family members. The judgment also overlooks the importance of factual accuracy and the potential harm of spreading misinformation, which is a key concern in the subreddit's guidelines. The mediation does not provide a balanced view of the arguments presented, nor does it consider the ethical implications of dismissing others' health choices.",

        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced view by acknowledging the importance of individual autonomy in health decisions and the right to express opinions about vaccines. It recognizes the complexity of the issue without taking a definitive stance on the correctness of vaccine policies. However, it could have done more to address the specific context of family dynamics and the emotional challenges faced by individuals standing up to antivaxx family members. The score reflects a fair assessment of the mediation's strengths and weaknesses.",
