    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the personal experience and valid sentiment expressed by Koalacita67, recognizing that high school can be a meaningful and enjoyable period for many people. It also addresses the dismissive tone in some comments and affirms the OP's feelings, which is a fair and balanced approach. The judgment is well-reasoned and supports the perspective that personal experiences and emotions should be taken seriously in such discussions.",

    },
    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation fails to adequately address the nuanced arguments presented. While it acknowledges the personal experience of Koalacita67, it does not properly consider the counterpoint that high school can be a time of peak experiences and that not everyone 'peaks' in high school. The judgment also overlooks the emotional and psychological aspects of the discussion, which are central to the original post and the responses. The mediation is somewhat biased towards Koalacita67's perspective without fully evaluating the other viewpoints.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges Koalacita67's personal experience and validates the OP's sentiment, which is crucial in a discussion about subjective experiences. It also recognizes that some comments may be dismissive, which is important for maintaining a balanced and respectful dialogue. However, it could have provided a more nuanced analysis of the different viewpoints presented, such as the argument that high school can be a peak experience for some. Overall, the mediation is fair and supports the valid emotional and personal perspectives shared.",
