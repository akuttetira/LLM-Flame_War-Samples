    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the person advocating for friends to respect the OP's specific boundary is more in the right. The discussion highlights the importance of respecting personal boundaries, especially in sensitive contexts like abuse. The argument emphasizes the emotional impact of using terms that trigger someone, which is a valid concern. The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the situation but ultimately supports the perspective that respecting personal boundaries is crucial, even if it's challenging for others to do so.",

        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the person advocating for friends to respect the OP's boundary is in the right. However, the judgment is somewhat vague and does not fully address the complexity of the situation. The OP's request is valid and important, but the mediation does not adequately consider the perspective that some people may not be able to consistently respect boundaries due to lack of awareness or intention. The judgment could have been more nuanced, acknowledging both the importance of the boundary and the challenges in enforcing it. Overall, the mediation is fair but could have been more detailed in its reasoning.",

It acknowledges the validity of the OP's concern and the challenge of enforcing it, which is a balanced approach. The mediation does not fully address the complexity of the situation, such as the difficulty in changing behavior or the potential for miscommunication, but it still provides a fair and respectful assessment of the key issue.",
