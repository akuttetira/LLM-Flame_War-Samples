    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the importance of setting boundaries with family members and recognizes the potential for abuse, which is a key point in the discussion. It also correctly identifies that the original post was about a parent-child relationship, not a spousal one, and that the comment about 'no normal person would do that' was inappropriate in context. The judgment is fair and balanced, giving credit to those who support the OP's autonomy while critiquing the dismissive comments.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the situation and recognizes the importance of setting boundaries with a parent, which is a valid and respectful stance. However, it fails to fully address the serious issue of potential abuse and the importance of consent in any relationship. The judgment leans too much towards defending the OP's decision without adequately considering the potential for abuse and the need for clear boundaries in all relationships, especially between parents and children. This oversight weakens the mediation's effectiveness and neutrality.",
