    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges that the argument for football being inherently apolitical is more defensible, which aligns with the reasoning in the conversation where one side argues that football has not always been political and that politics are a recent addition. The mediation also correctly identifies the counter-argument that football has always been political, but it does not fully resolve the debate, as both sides present strong points. The score reflects the balance between the two perspectives, with a slight edge to the argument that football is not inherently political.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance the argument by acknowledging both perspectives but leans slightly towards the claim that football is inherently apolitical. However, it fails to adequately address the strong historical and cultural evidence that football has always been intertwined with politics. The mediation also does not clearly resolve the debate about the role of politics in modern football, leaving room for further contention. The reasoning is somewhat neutral but lacks depth in evaluating the historical and cultural context of football's political involvement.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the complexity of the debate by recognizing that both perspectives have merit. It correctly identifies that the argument for football being inherently apolitical is more defensible, while also noting the counter-argument that football has always been political. However, it does not fully engage with the historical and cultural context provided in the conversation, which could have strengthened the resolution. The score reflects a balanced approach that acknowledges the strengths of both sides but could have been more thorough in addressing the historical evidence.",
