        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument about Mbappe's nationality and ethnicity being used to mock him is more valid and sensitive than the claim about his talent. It acknowledges the potential for racial bias and the importance of not diminishing someone's achievements based on their background. The reasoning is fair and highlights the more concerning aspect of the conversation.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation incorrectly prioritizes the argument about nationality and ethnicity over the argument about talent. The conversation contains racist and derogatory remarks about Mbappe's talent and background, which are more harmful and factually incorrect. The mediation fails to adequately address the racist undertones and instead shifts focus to a less critical point. The judgment is not neutral and shows a bias towards defending Mbappe's nationality rather than condemning the racist comments.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively addresses the key issue of racial bias in the conversation, acknowledging that the argument about Mbappe's nationality and ethnicity being used to mock him is more sensitive and concerning. It correctly identifies the more problematic aspect of the discussion while also recognizing the validity of the talent argument. The reasoning is fair and balanced, though it could have provided more context about the specific racist remarks in the conversation.",
