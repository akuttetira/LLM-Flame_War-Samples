        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the global popularity and financial viability of soccer, which is a key point in the discussion. It also recognizes the US-specific perspective while giving more weight to the broader argument. The reasoning is balanced and highlights the strengths of soccer's global appeal, which is a fair and effective judgment.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation fails to address the core arguments presented. The negative bias is evident in the judgment that dismisses the US perspective as overly simplistic. The mediation overlooks the strong financial data supporting the NFL, MLB, and NBA, and the fact that soccer's popularity is not universally recognized, especially in the US. The judgment also fails to acknowledge the valid point about soccer's global appeal and the argument that it is not just about monetary value.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively balances the global appeal of soccer with the US-specific context, acknowledging the financial strength of American sports while recognizing soccer's broader popularity. It avoids taking a clear side and provides a nuanced perspective that addresses key points from both sides of the argument.",
