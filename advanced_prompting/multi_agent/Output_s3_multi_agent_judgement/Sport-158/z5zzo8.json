    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the supportive and solution-oriented nature of the comments, which is a positive aspect. It correctly identifies that the commenters are providing support rather than making assumptions or threats, which is a fair and neutral assessment of the situation.",
        "score": 4
    },
    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation fails to address the core issue of the original conversation, which revolves around speculation and commentary on a person's potential infidelity. The judgment that 'commenters are more in the right' is overly simplistic and does not critically evaluate the flawed reasoning or potential harm in the comments. The mediation also lacks neutrality by not acknowledging the problematic nature of making assumptions about someone's personal life without evidence.",

    },
    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation partially addresses the conversation by acknowledging the supportive nature of the comments, but it fails to adequately address the problematic aspect of making assumptions about someone's personal life without evidence. While it recognizes the comments as being more supportive than threatening, it does not fully critique the flawed reasoning or the potential harm in the comments. A score of 3 reflects a balanced view that acknowledges some positive aspects but also points out the lack of critical evaluation.",
