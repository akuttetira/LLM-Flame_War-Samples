    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the strong arguments against Suarez, including his past misconduct and the validity of public outrage. It also recognizes the counterargument that his past actions may not fully justify current treatment, but ultimately leans towards the side that sees Suarez's behavior as a valid reason for public criticism. The reasoning is balanced and acknowledges the complexity of the issue.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation fails to adequately address the complexity of the arguments presented. It dismisses the claim that Suarez's past actions are irrelevant to his current situation without providing a thorough analysis of the evidence. The mediation also overlooks the nuanced debate around the use of offensive language and the context of his actions. A more balanced evaluation would consider the historical context, the specific incidents cited, and the differing interpretations of Suarez's behavior.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced view by acknowledging both sides of the argument. It recognizes the validity of Suarez's past behavior and the public's reaction, while also noting that his past actions may not fully justify current treatment. However, it could have done more to address the nuances of the offensive language incident and the context of his actions.",
