    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the discussion and recognizes valid points on both sides, which shows a balanced approach. It avoids taking a clear stance and instead highlights the nuanced nature of the debate, which is appropriate given the historical and cultural context of the conversation. The mediation does not favor one side over the other and remains neutral in its assessment.",

    },
    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation output fails to decisively determine which side is correct, instead presenting a balanced view that does not address the specific arguments or historical context presented in the conversation. While it acknowledges the complexity of the discussion, it does not clearly evaluate the validity of the claims made by either side, which is necessary for a fair and effective mediation. The output also lacks a clear judgment on the historical and political nuances of the topic, which are central to the debate.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the complexity of the discussion and recognizes valid points on both sides without taking a clear stance. It addresses the nuanced nature of the debate, including historical and cultural context, and maintains neutrality. However, it could have provided a slightly more detailed evaluation of the arguments presented, but overall it strikes a good balance between fairness and objectivity.",
