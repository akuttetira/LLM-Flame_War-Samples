        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to judge the 'wrongfulness' of the comment but lacks concrete reasoning. It fails to address the context of the conversation, which is about sports teams and their matchups. The comment about wearing a dildo on one's head is extreme and inappropriate, but the mediation does not provide a clear, neutral justification for this judgment. It also does not explain why the other comments are 'simply expressing team preferences' without context. The reasoning is vague and lacks a fair evaluation of the situation.",
