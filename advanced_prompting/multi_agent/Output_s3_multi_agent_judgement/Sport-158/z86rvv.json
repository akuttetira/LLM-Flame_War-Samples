        "rationale": "The mediation correctly acknowledges the complexity of fan behavior in both Argentina and Brazil, recognizing that generalizing entire fan bases as racist is unfair. It highlights the nuance in the arguments presented, which is important for a fair evaluation. The judgment is balanced and avoids taking sides in a simplistic manner.",

        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the issue and the unfair generalization of fan behavior, which is a positive approach. However, it could have been more critical of the argument that all Argentine fans are racist, as the original conversation includes statements that explicitly call Brazilian fans racists. A more balanced judgment would have considered the context and potential bias in the arguments presented.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively addresses the issue of generalizing fan behavior and acknowledges the complexity of the arguments presented. It correctly identifies that blaming all Argentine fans for the actions of a few is unfair, which is a key point in the conversation. However, it could have been more critical of the explicit racist statements made by some users, particularly the one that directly calls Brazilian fans racists. The score reflects a balanced approach that recognizes the nuance but could have been more thorough in addressing the specific criticisms.",
