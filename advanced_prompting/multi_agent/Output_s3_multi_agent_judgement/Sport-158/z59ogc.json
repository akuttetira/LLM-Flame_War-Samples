    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the argument, recognizing that the draw could be seen as a sign of the US team's growing strength rather than a loss. It also correctly identifies that the claim of US inferiority is less defensible. The reasoning is fair and considers multiple perspectives, though it could have been more detailed in explaining the nuances of the debate.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation incorrectly concludes that the argument about the US team's draw being a sign of their growing strength is more defensible. The conversation contains multiple instances where users criticize the US team's performance, including claims that the US team is not a serious competitor and that the draw is a result of the US team's lack of skill. The mediation fails to address these criticisms and instead supports a perspective that is not well-supported by the conversation. The reasoning is flawed and does not accurately reflect the arguments presented.",

        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced view by acknowledging that the argument about the US team's draw as a sign of growing strength is more defensible than the claim of US inferiority. It correctly identifies that the claim of US inferiority is less defensible, which aligns with the positive rationale. However, it could have been more detailed in addressing the criticisms of the US team's performance mentioned in the conversation. The score reflects a fair assessment that recognizes the mediation's strengths while noting its limited depth in addressing the conversation's nuances.",
