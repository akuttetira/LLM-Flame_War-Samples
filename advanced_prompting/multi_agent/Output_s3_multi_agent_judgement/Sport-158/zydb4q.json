        "rationale": "The mediation fails to address the core issue of the debate between mourning and celebrating Pel\u00e9's life, instead focusing on the personal attacks and accusations. It also does not clearly determine which side is correct in the argument, leaving the judgment vague and unhelpful. The mediation lacks a clear, fair, and neutral evaluation of the arguments presented.",
