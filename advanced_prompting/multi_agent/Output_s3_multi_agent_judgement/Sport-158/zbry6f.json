        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the debate, recognizing that both sides present valid points. It correctly identifies that the argument about American football and baseball being more skillful and entertaining is more defensible, while also noting the cultural factors that influence perceptions of soccer. This balanced approach reflects a fair and nuanced understanding of the discussion.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance the arguments but fails to adequately address the core issue. It acknowledges the skill and entertainment value of American football and baseball but does not fully counter the claim that soccer is inherently boring or less impressive. The mediation also does not clearly resolve the cultural factors argument, which is central to the discussion. The reasoning is somewhat balanced but lacks depth in evaluating the validity of the claims made by both sides.",
