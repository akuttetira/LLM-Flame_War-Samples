        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the debate and the validity of points on both sides, which is fair and balanced. However, it does not decisively determine which side is correct, which is expected in a mediation context. The response is neutral and does not show a clear bias, making it a 4/5. It avoids taking sides and presents the discussion as nuanced, which is appropriate for a mediation setting.",
