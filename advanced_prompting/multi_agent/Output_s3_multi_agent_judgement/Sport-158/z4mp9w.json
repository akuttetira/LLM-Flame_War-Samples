    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the differing perspectives on the situation, recognizing that some view the action as a minor annoyance while others see it as disrespectful. It gives credit to those who defend McKennie's actions as less severe, which is a fair and balanced assessment considering the context and the arguments presented.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation slightly favors the defenders of McKennie's actions, but the reasoning is flawed. While it's true that using a photographer's bib to dry hands could be seen as a minor annoyance, the mediation downplays the potential for perceived disrespect and insensitivity. The argument that it's 'just rude' is valid, and the mediation fails to adequately address the cultural context and the potential for offense, especially in a high-stakes event like the World Cup. A more balanced approach would consider both perspectives but not dismiss the concern about rudeness and disrespect.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced view by acknowledging both perspectives: the defense that the action is a minor annoyance and the criticism that it is disrespectful. It correctly identifies that the situation is subjective and context-dependent, which is important given the nature of the debate. However, it slightly leans towards the defenders, which the negative response argues is a flaw. Overall, the mediation is fair and effective in addressing the key points of the conversation.",
