        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the argument but fails to decisively determine which side is correct. It avoids taking a clear stance, which is expected, but the lack of a clear judgment may be seen as insufficient given the context of the conversation. The mediation is neutral and balanced, but it does not provide a strong enough conclusion to fully resolve the debate.",

It maintains a neutral and balanced approach without taking a clear side, which is appropriate given the nature of the conversation.
