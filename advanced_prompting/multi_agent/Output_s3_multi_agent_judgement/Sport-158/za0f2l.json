It avoids taking a clear side and instead emphasizes the need for a more objective analysis of the game's data.

        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the argument but fails to decisively determine which side is correct. It avoids taking a clear stance and instead presents both sides as valid, which is fair but not fully effective in resolving the dispute. The discussion revolves around the merits of possession as a metric, with valid counterpoints from both sides. However, the mediation does not provide a clear conclusion or judgment on which perspective is more accurate or justified based on the evidence presented.",
