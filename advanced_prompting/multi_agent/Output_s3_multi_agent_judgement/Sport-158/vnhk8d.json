        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the nuanced discussion around Camavinga's potential creativity and the implicit racial bias in evaluating players of color. However, it fails to adequately address the specific arguments made by both sides. The mediation does not clearly determine which side is correct, and it does not provide a balanced evaluation of the arguments presented. It also does not address the technical aspects of Camavinga's playing style and the validity of the claims about his creativity.",
