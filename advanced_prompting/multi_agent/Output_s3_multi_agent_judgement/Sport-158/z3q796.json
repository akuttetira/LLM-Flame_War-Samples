    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the comments made by normalmisha are more offensive and inappropriate compared to the others. The judgment focuses on the content of the comments and their insensitivity, which is a valid assessment of the conversation. The reasoning is clear and highlights the more harmful behavior, which aligns with the goal of mediation to address and resolve conflicts fairly.",

    },
    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation incorrectly assumes that being late to the conversation is not a valid point of contention, while failing to acknowledge that the comments made by normalmisha may have been contextually appropriate. The judgment also fails to consider the possibility that the comments could have been misunderstood or that the timing of the response might have been relevant. The mediation shows a bias towards the side that criticizes normalmisha without fully addressing the context or the potential for misinterpretation.",

    },
    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a reasonable assessment by acknowledging the more harmful behavior of normalmisha's comments compared to the others. However, it oversimplifies the situation by not fully considering the context of the conversation, such as the timing of the responses and the potential for misinterpretation. While the positive rationale is valid, the negative rationale highlights important contextual factors that should be considered in mediation. The score reflects a balanced view that the mediation is partially effective but lacks full neutrality and context consideration.",
