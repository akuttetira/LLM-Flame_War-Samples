    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of advertising timelines and the possibility of pre-planned campaigns, which is a reasonable and evidence-based approach. It also correctly identifies the more credible argument regarding advertising processes over the claim of a rigged game, which is a fair and balanced judgment.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation fails to adequately address the core argument about the ad's creation timeline and the possibility of the game being rigged. It dismisses the concern about the ad being released too quickly without sufficient evidence or consideration of the emotional impact on viewers. The reasoning is somewhat dismissive and lacks a balanced evaluation of the arguments presented.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced assessment by acknowledging the credibility of the advertising process argument while also addressing the concern about the ad's release timeline. It correctly identifies the more plausible explanation for the ad's timing and avoids dismissing the original concern outright. However, it could have done more to explore the emotional and ethical implications of the rapid ad release.",
