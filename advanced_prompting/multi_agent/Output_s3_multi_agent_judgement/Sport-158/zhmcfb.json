    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the historical context of Article 25 and the presence of a large Jewish population in Argentina, which are important points in the discussion. It also correctly identifies that blanket claims of widespread racism and Nazi sympathies are not fully supported by the conversation. The mediation provides a balanced perspective by recognizing valid arguments on both sides while giving more weight to the historical and demographic context.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation fails to adequately address the strong arguments presented by multiple users that Argentina has a history of racial discrimination and racism, including the racial policies outlined in Article 25 of the Constitution and the historical context of Nazi sympathies. While the mediation acknowledges the historical context, it downplays the widespread experience of racism reported by users from Brazil and other South American countries. The judgment appears to favor the argument that Argentina is not predominantly racist, which may not reflect the broader experiences and historical realities discussed in the conversation.",
