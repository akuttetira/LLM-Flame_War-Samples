    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the situation, recognizing that the gesture was intended as a tribute and that it may be misinterpreted. It also addresses the counterargument that the gesture could be seen as racist, but ultimately finds the argument that it is a misinterpretation more compelling. This shows a balanced consideration of both sides, with a favorable assessment of the side that emphasizes intent and context.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation fails to adequately address the core issue of racial insensitivity. While it acknowledges the possibility of misinterpretation, it does not sufficiently counter the argument that the gesture could still be considered racist. The judgment leans towards the side that claims the gesture is racist, which is a flawed conclusion given the context and potential for misunderstanding. The mediation also does not provide a clear, neutral evaluation of the arguments presented.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the situation by considering both the intent behind the gesture and the potential for misinterpretation. It correctly identifies that the argument emphasizing intent and context is more compelling than the blanket claim of racism. However, it could have provided a more thorough analysis of the potential for racial insensitivity and the nuances of cultural context. The score reflects a balanced evaluation that recognizes the mediation's strengths while noting its limitations in fully addressing the racial implications.",
