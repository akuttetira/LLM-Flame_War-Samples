        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the argument, recognizing that both sides have valid points. However, it fails to clearly determine which side is correct based on the evidence presented. The discussion involves subjective interpretations of what constitutes a foul in football, and the mediation does not provide a definitive conclusion. While it is fair to say the issue is nuanced, the mediation could have been more explicit in addressing the core of the dispute.",
