    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the core argument is about the reason for England's loss, with the claim that France was superior being more defensible than blaming England's fans for their reaction. The reasoning acknowledges the debate over team performance and the emotional response of fans, which is a fair and balanced assessment of the conversation.",

        "rationale": "The mediation incorrectly labels the argument that England\u2019s loss is due to France\u2019s superiority as 'more defensible' when it fails to address the actual reasoning presented. The mediation overlooks the fact that the conversation is filled with insults and personal attacks, not a clear argument about team performance. Additionally, the mediation incorrectly frames the discussion as a debate about team performance rather than a series of disparaging remarks. The judgment is biased and fails to properly analyze the arguments presented.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively addresses the core issue of the conversation by distinguishing between the argument about team performance and the emotional reactions of fans. It correctly identifies that the claim about France's superiority is a more defensible point than blaming fans for being salty. However, it does not fully address the underlying tone of the conversation, which is filled with personal insults and hostility. The score reflects a balanced assessment that acknowledges the mediation's strengths while noting its limitations in fully addressing the negative tone of the original discussion.",
