        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the argument, recognizing that both sides present valid points regarding rule interpretation and referee discretion. It avoids a definitive judgment and instead highlights the nuanced nature of the debate, which is appropriate given the context of the discussion.",

        "rationale": "The mediation output fails to provide a clear judgment on which side is correct, instead presenting the argument as nuanced with valid points on both sides. This lack of decisive judgment undermines the purpose of a mediation, which is to resolve the dispute by determining the correct interpretation. The mediation does not address the specific rule interpretation or the referee's role effectively, and it does not offer a clear resolution to the debate. As a result, the mediation is overly vague and does not meet the standards of a fair and effective resolution.",

However, it fails to provide a clear resolution or determination of which interpretation is correct, which is essential in a mediation.
