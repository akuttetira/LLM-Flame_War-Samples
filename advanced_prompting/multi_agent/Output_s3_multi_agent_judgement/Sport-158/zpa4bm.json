    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the valid concern about the financial implications of the FIFA World Cup and the argument that oil money might be involved, which is a reasonable and nuanced approach. It also recognizes the social context and the real concerns raised by users, showing a balanced perspective.",

    },
    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation output fails to adequately address the complexity of the argument. While the claim about oil money is presented as more defensible, it overlooks the broader context of the conversation, including the emotional and social implications raised by the users. The mediation also does not provide a balanced evaluation of the arguments, showing a bias towards one perspective without sufficient reasoning or evidence. Additionally, the response is vague and lacks a clear, neutral judgment on which side is correct.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced acknowledgment of the financial and social implications discussed in the conversation, recognizing the validity of concerns about the FIFA World Cup's funding and the emotional context of the users' comments. However, it could have been more specific in addressing the arguments presented, particularly the debate around oil money versus other forms of funding. The response is fair but somewhat vague in its conclusion.",
