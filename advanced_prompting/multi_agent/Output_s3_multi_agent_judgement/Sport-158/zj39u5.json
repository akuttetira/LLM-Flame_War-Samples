    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the validity of the argument that Croatia's draw-heavy performance in the group stage could indicate a 'group of death,' which is a reasonable and fair assessment of the discussion. It also correctly identifies that dismissing Croatia as a poor team or their strategy as luck is less convincing. The reasoning is balanced and highlights the stronger argument presented in the conversation.",

    },
    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation fails to adequately address the core arguments presented. It dismisses the claim that Croatia is not a good team and that their strategy is luck-based, which are valid points raised by multiple users. The mediation also overlooks the context of the group stage and the fact that drawing with strong teams like Belgium and Morocco does not necessarily indicate a 'group of death' in terms of tournament success. The judgment is biased towards the argument that Croatia's performance is not a result of being in a difficult group, despite the evidence suggesting otherwise.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced assessment by acknowledging the argument that Croatia's draw-heavy group stage performance could indicate a 'group of death,' while also recognizing the counterarguments that Croatia may not be a strong team and that their strategy might be luck-based. However, it does not fully engage with the nuances of the discussion, such as the context of the group stage and the implications of drawing with strong teams. The score is moderate as the mediation is fair but could have been more thorough in addressing all perspectives.",
