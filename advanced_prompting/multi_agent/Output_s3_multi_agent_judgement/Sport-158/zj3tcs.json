    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that Khunzar-ri's defense of their country and right to enjoy rivalries is more justified. The argument acknowledges the legitimacy of national pride and rivalry, while also pointing out the inflammatory and racist nature of Legoleamela's comments. This judgment is fair, effective, and neutral in evaluating the contributions of both parties.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation incorrectly labels Legoleamela's comment as 'racist' without proper context. The comment 'A person who have no country post this' is not inherently racist, and the subsequent exchange does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that Legoleamela's remarks were racist. The mediation also fails to acknowledge the complexity of the conversation and the potential for misinterpretation. Additionally, the judgment is overly one-sided and does not address the broader context of the discussion.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the legitimacy of Khunzar-ri's defense of their country and the right to enjoy rivalries, while also correctly identifying Legoleamela's comments as inflammatory and potentially racist. The rationale provided by the positive judge is well-reasoned, fair, and balanced, recognizing the context of national pride and the harmful nature of the other party's comments. The negative judge's concerns about context and potential misinterpretation are valid but the mediation's overall assessment is appropriate given the content of the comments.",
