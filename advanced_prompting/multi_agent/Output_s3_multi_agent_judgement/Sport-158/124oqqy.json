        "rationale": "The mediation effectively highlights the distinction between historical performance and coach's impact. It acknowledges the flaws in using past results as a predictor and recognizes the significant role a coach can play in a match's outcome. The reasoning is balanced and addresses the key points raised in the conversation.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation's conclusion is somewhat flawed. It fails to adequately address the specific arguments presented by both sides. The claim that a coach's decisions can single-handedly determine the outcome of a match is overly simplistic and ignores the complex interplay of factors in sports. Additionally, the mediation does not sufficiently critique the argument that past performance is a reliable indicator of future success, which is a common fallacy in sports discussions. The judgment is somewhat neutral but lacks depth in evaluating the reasoning behind each side's claims.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively addresses the key points of the conversation by distinguishing between historical performance and coach's impact. It correctly identifies the flaw in using past results as a predictor and acknowledges the significant role a coach can play. However, it could have provided more nuanced analysis of the complex factors in sports outcomes. The reasoning is generally balanced but could have been more comprehensive.",
