        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that ucccft's defense of Argentina and Messi is more justified, as it acknowledges the global admiration for the team and Messi, and addresses the xenophobic comments made by Weak-Pudding-322. The argument is fair, effective, and neutral in tone, providing context and examples to support the conclusion.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation incorrectly labels Weak-Pudding-322's comments as 'xenophobic' without proper context. The user's statement about Argentinians being 'a-holes' is a personal opinion, not a generalization about all Argentinians. Additionally, the mediation fails to acknowledge that Weak-Pudding-322's point about fan loyalty and the possibility of decreased support in 2026 is a valid concern. The judgment is biased and does not fully consider the complexity of the arguments presented.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the global admiration for Argentina and Messi, as well as the xenophobic nature of Weak-Pudding-322's comments. However, it oversimplifies the discussion by not fully addressing the valid concern about fan loyalty and the potential for decreased support in 2026. The conclusion is somewhat fair but could have been more balanced.",
