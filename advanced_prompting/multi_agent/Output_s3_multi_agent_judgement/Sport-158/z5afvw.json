    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of comparing Saudi Arabia's human rights record to other countries, recognizing the historical context of some nations and the nuances of refugee treatment. It also highlights the potential for unfair comparison, which shows a balanced approach to the discussion. The judgment is reasonable and considers multiple perspectives without taking a one-sided stance.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation incorrectly prioritizes the argument about Saudi Arabia's human rights record over the criticism of its refugee policy. The mediation fails to address the validity of the refugee policy criticism, which is more directly relevant to the discussion. The judgment is flawed because it dismisses the refugee issue without proper analysis, showing a bias towards defending Saudi Arabia's position without sufficient evidence.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the discussion, recognizing both the historical context of Saudi Arabia's human rights record and the refugee policy criticism. It provides a balanced perspective by suggesting that the human rights argument is more defensible, but it does not fully address the validity of the refugee policy criticism. The judgment is somewhat reasonable but could have been more thorough in evaluating both sides.",
