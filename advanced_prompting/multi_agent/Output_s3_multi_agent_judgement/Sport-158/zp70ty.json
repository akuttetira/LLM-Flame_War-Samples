    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the original comment praised Peter Drury's commentary, and the response from 'Miguelomaniac' addressed the troll's inability to take a joke. The judgment acknowledges the constructive engagement with the troll's comment rather than dismissing it outright, which is fair and reasonable.",

    },
    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the conversation but fails to address the potential for misinterpretation and the context of online interactions. It also overlooks the possibility that the original comment could be seen as overly enthusiastic or dismissive, and does not fully consider the nuances of the exchange. The judgment leans towards one side without thoroughly examining all perspectives.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the original comment's positive intent and the constructive response to the troll's comment. It recognizes the value of engaging with the troll's message rather than dismissing it, which reflects a balanced approach. However, it could have provided more context about the online dynamics at play and the potential for misinterpretation, which the negative rationale points out. Overall, it is a fair and reasonable assessment.",
