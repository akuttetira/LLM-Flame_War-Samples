    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the defense of the handmade card as a genuine expression of admiration is more justified. The argument acknowledges the creative intent behind the card and counters the dismissive label of 'dickriding' with a more nuanced perspective. This shows a balanced understanding of the situation and a fair evaluation of the arguments presented.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation incorrectly concludes that the defender of the handmade card is more right. The criticism of 'dickriding' is a valid expression of disdain for insincere admiration, and the defense of the card as a genuine expression of admiration is not necessarily more correct. The mediation fails to acknowledge the nuance in the conversation and the potential for subjective interpretation of 'dickriding' as a term of abuse.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced view by acknowledging the defense of the handmade card as a genuine expression of admiration while also recognizing the validity of the criticism of 'dickriding' as a dismissive term. However, it slightly oversimplifies the nuance of the conversation by not fully addressing the context and potential subjectivity of the term 'dickriding'. The score is a middle ground between the positive and negative responses.",
