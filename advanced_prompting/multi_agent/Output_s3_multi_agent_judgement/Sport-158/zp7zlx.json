        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance both sides but fails to address the underlying issues of toxicity and lack of respect in the conversation. While it acknowledges that Martinez's behavior was classless, it doesn't adequately condemn the harsh and disrespectful tone of the criticism. The judgment is overly neutral and doesn't clearly identify the more problematic side of the exchange.",
