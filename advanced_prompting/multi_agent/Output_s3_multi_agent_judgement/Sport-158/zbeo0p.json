        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the person defending the referee's kindness and impartiality is more in the right. The arguments from the deleted user provide specific, factual information about the referee's behavior and character, while the other posters engage in aggressive, inflammatory, and unsubstantiated claims. The mediation acknowledges the validity of the defense and the lack of substance in the opposing arguments, which is a fair and effective assessment.",

        "rationale": "The mediation fails to acknowledge the lack of concrete evidence supporting either side's claims. The 'defender' of the referee's kindness provides a personal account without credible sources, while the 'aggressive posters' make baseless accusations. The mediation incorrectly assumes the defender is more correct without addressing the lack of factual basis for either argument. The judgment is biased and lacks critical evaluation of the arguments presented.",
