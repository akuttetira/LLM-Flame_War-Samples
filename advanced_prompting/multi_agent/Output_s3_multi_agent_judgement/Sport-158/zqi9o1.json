        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the reasonable argument for protecting Cristian Romero and his son from inappropriate behavior, which is a fair and respectful approach. It avoids endorsing calls for physical harm or humiliation, which aligns with a neutral and effective mediation stance. The judgment is balanced and highlights the importance of respecting individuals, even in the context of public figures.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation fails to address the core issue of whether Cristian Calderon's actions were inappropriate or harmful. It instead shifts focus to a more abstract concept of 'reasonableness,' which is not grounded in the specific context of the conversation. The mediation also overlooks the potential for physical harm and humiliation mentioned in the comments, which were explicitly discussed in the conversation. The judgment is vague and does not provide a clear reasoning for why one side is more correct than the other.",
