    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the argument, recognizing that Japan's victory could be seen as undeserved due to external factors or overhyped opponents. It also critiques the blanket claim that the win was 'insane' or 'unfair' without evidence, which shows a balanced approach to the discussion. The reasoning is fair and considers multiple perspectives without taking a definitive side.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the argument but fails to adequately address the underlying bias and lack of evidence in the original claims. The judgment leans towards the side that Japan's victory was fair, but it doesn't sufficiently counter the argument that the win was 'insane' or 'unfair' without proper justification. The mediation also doesn't engage with the emotional and nationalistic undertones in the conversation, which are significant in this context.",
