    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of predicting sports outcomes and differentiates between a reasonable argument about past performance and an overly definitive claim. It correctly identifies that the claim 'England will NEVER win the World Cup again' is too absolute and not supported by the evidence presented, while the argument about past performance is more nuanced and reasonable.",

    },
    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance the argument by acknowledging England's past performance as a factor but also critiques the absolute claim that they will never win again. However, the reasoning is somewhat flawed because it doesn't fully address the underlying issue of the blanket statement being overly deterministic. The mediation also fails to consider the possibility that the original claim might be based on historical context rather than a definitive conclusion. The score is moderate because the mediation provides some nuance but lacks a more comprehensive analysis of the arguments presented.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively addresses the key issue by distinguishing between a reasonable argument about past performance and an overly absolute claim. It correctly identifies the problematic nature of the 'never win again' statement while acknowledging the validity of considering historical performance as a factor. The response is fair, balanced, and provides a clear distinction between the two viewpoints.",
