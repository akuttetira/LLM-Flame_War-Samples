    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the validity of the argument that the DualSense has more features and better battery life than the DualShock 4, which is a correct point. It also addresses the concern about battery life but does not fully resolve the debate around the controller's battery life compared to other controllers. The reasoning is fair and considers multiple perspectives, but it could have been more comprehensive in evaluating the claims about firmware updates and battery life.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance the discussion by acknowledging the DualSense's features and battery life while addressing concerns about battery life. However, it fails to adequately address the technical and practical aspects of firmware updates for the DualShock 4, which are a key point of contention. The mediation also doesn't clearly establish which side is more correct in the debate, leading to a lack of definitive judgment.",
