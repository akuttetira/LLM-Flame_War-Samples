    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges that KoreanGamer22's suggestions are more reasonable, which is a positive step. However, the mediation does not thoroughly address the complexities of the issue, such as the cultural context of cheating in Asian gaming communities, the role of region locks, and the broader societal factors influencing these behaviors. The score is moderate as the mediation partially recognizes the validity of alternative viewpoints but lacks a comprehensive analysis of the underlying issues.",

        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced view by acknowledging the validity of KoreanGamer22's suggestions while also recognizing the complexities of the issue. It does not oversimplify the problem or make sweeping generalizations about cultural differences. However, it could have delved deeper into the systemic and cultural factors that contribute to the hacking issue, such as the role of region locks and the broader societal pressures in some Asian gaming communities. The score reflects a fair and nuanced evaluation of the mediation.",
