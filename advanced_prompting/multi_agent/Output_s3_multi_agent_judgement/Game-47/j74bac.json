        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced view of the discussion, acknowledging the complexity of 3D printing custom PS5 side panels. It recognizes valid points on both sides, such as the challenges of size, cost, and technical feasibility, as well as the potential for customization and creativity. The judgment is fair and acknowledges the nuanced nature of the debate.",

        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the issue and presents a balanced view, recognizing valid points on both sides. However, it lacks a clear resolution or determination of which side is correct, which is necessary for a meaningful judgment. The mediation does not explicitly address the technical feasibility, cost, or practicality of 3D printing PS5 side panels in a way that provides a definitive conclusion.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively captures the nuanced discussion around 3D printing custom PS5 side panels, acknowledging both the technical challenges (size, cost, feasibility) and the potential for customization and creativity. It provides a balanced view without taking a definitive stance, which is appropriate given the complexity of the issue. However, it could have slightly more explicitly addressed the technical feasibility and practicality aspects to provide a more complete assessment.",
