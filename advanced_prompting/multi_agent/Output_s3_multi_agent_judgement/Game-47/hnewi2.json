        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the discussion, recognizing that both sides present valid points. It highlights that the conversation is nuanced, with some arguments being more substantiated than others. This approach shows a balanced perspective without taking a definitive stance on which side is entirely correct, which is fair and objective.",

        "rationale": "The mediation output fails to clearly determine which side is correct in the debate over the severity of the pandemic compared to past events. It provides a general statement that the discussion is nuanced but does not offer a specific judgment on the validity of the arguments presented. The mediation lacks a clear resolution and does not address the specific points made by the users, such as the death toll, recovery rates, and historical comparisons to past pandemics. As a result, the mediation is vague and does not provide a fair or effective resolution to the dispute.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the complexity of the discussion and the validity of multiple perspectives without taking a definitive stance. It recognizes that some points are more substantiated than others, which is a fair and balanced approach. However, it could have provided a slightly more specific evaluation of the arguments presented, such as the death toll, recovery rates, and historical comparisons. Nonetheless, the overall approach is neutral, fair, and effective.",
