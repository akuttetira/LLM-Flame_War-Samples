        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the situation, recognizing that the leaks and controversy are influenced by both the game's direction and the leaker's actions. It also highlights the importance of not making blanket claims about the game's quality based on the leaks. This balanced approach reflects a fair and nuanced understanding of the arguments presented in the conversation.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance the arguments but fails to fully address the core issues. It acknowledges the complexity of the situation but does not clearly determine which side is more correct. The mediation leans towards the argument that the leaks and controversy are a result of the game's poor direction and the leaker's actions, but this conclusion is not strongly supported by the evidence presented. The mediation also does not adequately address the concerns about the spread of false information and the impact on the gaming community.",

        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced view by acknowledging the complexity of the situation and the influence of both the game's direction and the leaker's actions. It correctly notes that making blanket claims about the game's quality based on leaks is problematic. However, it does not fully address the concerns about the spread of false information and the impact on the gaming community, which are significant aspects of the discussion. The score reflects a fair assessment of the mediation's strengths and weaknesses.",
