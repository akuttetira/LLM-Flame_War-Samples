        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the PS5 controller flash feature is not new and was available on the PS4 in 2014. The reasoning acknowledges the contributions of users who provided historical context and technical details, which support the claim that the feature predates the PS5. This judgment is fair and effectively addresses the debate by recognizing the validity of the historical perspective.",

        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the PS5 controller flash feature was available on the PS4 in 2014, which undermines the claim that it is a PS5 exclusive feature. However, the mediation fails to acknowledge that the feature's functionality may have been enhanced or made more accessible on the PS5, and it does not fully address the valid points made by those who argue that the PS5's implementation is more advanced or user-friendly. The reasoning is mostly accurate but lacks nuance.",

        "rationale": "The mediation accurately acknowledges that the PS5 controller flash feature was available on the PS4 in 2014, which directly counters the claim of it being a PS5 exclusive feature. It correctly identifies the more valid perspective of the users who provided historical context. However, it could have slightly more fully addressed the nuances of the feature's evolution, but the overall judgment is fair and effective.",
