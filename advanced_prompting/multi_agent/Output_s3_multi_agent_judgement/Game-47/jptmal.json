        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the second response, which points out the eBay sellers as the real victims, is more constructive and reasonable compared to the first response, which uses personal attacks. The judgment highlights the positive aspect of the second response while appropriately addressing the negative behavior in the first.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the validity of pointing out eBay sellers as victims but fails to fully address the negative bias towards the original poster's concerns. It also does not adequately condemn the personal attack ('stfu') without providing a clear justification for why that is problematic. The judgment is somewhat balanced but lacks depth in addressing the negative aspects of the original argument.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the constructive aspect of the second response by highlighting the eBay sellers as the real victims, while appropriately addressing the negative behavior in the first response with the 'stfu' personal attack. It provides a balanced assessment that recognizes the merits of one response while pointing out the flaws in the other, making it a fair and effective mediation.",
