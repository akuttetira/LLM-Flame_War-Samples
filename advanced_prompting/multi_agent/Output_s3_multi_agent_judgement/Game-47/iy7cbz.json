    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation correctly acknowledges that consoles can run games at 4K 60 FPS with optimized settings, which is supported by the discussion on how console developers can tailor settings for hardware. It also addresses the counterpoint that PC hardware can achieve 4K 60 FPS with optimized settings, which is also valid. The mediation provides a balanced view by not taking a single side entirely, which is fair and effective.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges that consoles can run games at 4K 60 FPS with optimized settings, which is a fair point. However, it fails to address the key issue that PC hardware can also achieve 4K 60 FPS with optimized settings, and the claim that consoles are inherently better at optimization is not universally true. The mediation also doesn't adequately address the complexity of game optimization and the fact that PC gaming offers more flexibility in settings. The score is moderate as the mediation partially acknowledges the complexity of the issue but doesn't fully counter the argument that PC hardware can also achieve 4K 60 FPS with optimized settings.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the complexity of the issue by recognizing that both consoles and PCs can achieve 4K 60 FPS with optimized settings. It correctly identifies that consoles are often optimized for specific hardware, which is a valid point. However, it could have done more to address the counterargument that PCs can also achieve similar results with proper settings. The mediation provides a balanced view but could have been more thorough in explaining the nuances of optimization across platforms.",
