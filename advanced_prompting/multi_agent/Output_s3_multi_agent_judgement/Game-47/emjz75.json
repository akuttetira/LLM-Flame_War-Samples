        "rationale": "The mediation fails to address the specific arguments presented in the conversation and instead makes a general judgment about the reasonableness of the argument. It also overlooks the presence of inflammatory and personal attacks, which are not necessarily tied to the quality of the game itself. The judgment is overly simplistic and does not provide a nuanced analysis of the conversation.",
