        "rationale": "The mediation output acknowledges the complexity of the debate and avoids taking a clear side, which is fair and balanced. However, it could have been more specific in addressing the core issue of backwards compatibility and the role of the PS1 and PS2 in the retro gaming scene. The score is moderate as the mediation avoids taking a definitive stance but could have provided more detailed analysis.",
