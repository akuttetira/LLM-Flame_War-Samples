    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the issue of artificial inflation in the GPU market caused by eBay scalpers and fake bids, which is a valid concern among users. It also correctly points out that the claim that everyone needs the latest GPU to play modern games is overly broad and not universally true, as many games run well on older GPUs. The reasoning is balanced and addresses both sides of the argument with appropriate nuance.",

        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the issue of eBay scalpers but fails to fully address the validity of the claims about the necessity of the latest GPU. It also does not adequately consider the diverse perspectives on gaming performance and the specific needs of different users. The judgment is somewhat balanced but lacks depth in evaluating the reasoning behind each side's arguments.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively addresses the key points in the conversation by acknowledging the issue of eBay scalpers and the artificial inflation of the GPU market, which is a valid concern. It also correctly identifies that the claim that everyone needs the latest GPU is overly broad and not universally true, as many games run well on older GPUs. The mediation provides a balanced perspective without overemphasizing either side, making it a fair and reasonable assessment of the discussion.",
