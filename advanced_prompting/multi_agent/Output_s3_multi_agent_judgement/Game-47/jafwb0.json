        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument about game performance on older hardware not affecting quality is more defensible. It acknowledges the nuanced discussion around cross-platform games and their quality, which is a key point in the conversation. The judgment is fair and captures the complexity of the debate without taking an extreme stance.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation fails to adequately address the core argument being made. The original discussion centers on the quality of cross-platform games and whether their performance on older hardware impacts their value. The mediation's conclusion is vague and doesn't clearly determine which side is more correct. It also doesn't properly acknowledge the logical fallacy in the claim that all cross-platform games are inferior, which is a key point in the conversation. The judgment lacks specific reasoning and fails to engage with the nuances of the debate.",
