    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the discussion, recognizing both market pressures and corporate motivations. It provides a balanced view by defending the market-driven reasoning behind CDPR's decision while critiquing the oversimplified corporate greed narrative. This approach reflects a nuanced understanding of the arguments presented.",

    },
    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance perspectives but fails to fully address the underlying issues. While it acknowledges market pressure as a factor, it overlooks the significant criticisms of EA's influence on game development and the broader corporate greed argument. The mediation also fails to adequately address the SJW-related criticisms and the debate over CDPR's corporate nature. The reasoning is somewhat flawed in not fully considering the negative biases and the complex interplay of factors in the conversation.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively balances the discussion by acknowledging market pressures as a valid reason for CDPR's decision while critiquing the oversimplified corporate greed narrative. It addresses the key points raised in the conversation, providing a nuanced perspective that reflects the complexity of the arguments. However, it could have done more to engage with the broader criticisms of EA's influence and the SJW-related concerns mentioned in the conversation.",
