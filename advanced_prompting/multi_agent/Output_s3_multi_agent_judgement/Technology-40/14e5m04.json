        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the situation, recognizing that user dissatisfaction could impact Reddit's IPO. It also notes that the claim about the blackout being a failure is not as defensible as the argument about potential negative impacts on the IPO. The reasoning is balanced and considers multiple perspectives, showing an understanding of the arguments presented.",

        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges that the argument about user unhappiness potentially affecting the IPO is more defensible, but it fails to adequately address the core issues of the debate. The mediation does not thoroughly evaluate the claims made by both sides, nor does it provide a clear, neutral assessment of the evidence presented. It also does not properly consider the lack of concrete data supporting the claims about the impact on metrics or the long-term value of Reddit. The judgment is somewhat balanced but lacks the depth needed to fairly assess the complexity of the arguments.",

        "rationale": "The mediation correctly identifies that the argument about user dissatisfaction potentially affecting the IPO is more defensible than the claim that the blackout was a failure. It acknowledges the complexity of the situation and the different perspectives involved. However, it could have provided a more thorough evaluation of the evidence and considered the lack of concrete data supporting the claims about the impact on metrics or long-term value. The reasoning is balanced but could have been more comprehensive.",
