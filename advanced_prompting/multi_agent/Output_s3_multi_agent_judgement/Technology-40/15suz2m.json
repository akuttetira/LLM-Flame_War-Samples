    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the situation and recognizes the validity of the argument that Louis Rossmann's community may have issues with racism, even if he is not directly responsible. It also notes the other side's dismissal of concerns and use of personal attacks, which is a fair assessment of the interaction. The judgment is balanced and considers the nuances of the arguments presented.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges that the person raising concerns about Louis Rossmann's community is more in the right, which is a positive stance. However, it fails to fully address the complexity of the arguments presented. The mediation overlooks the counterarguments that suggest the person raising concerns may be engaging in harassment or misrepresenting Rossmann's views. It also does not adequately consider the context of the debate, such as the potential for personal attacks and the importance of maintaining a respectful dialogue. While the mediation shows some understanding of the situation, it lacks depth and fails to fully evaluate the nuances of the arguments on both sides.",
