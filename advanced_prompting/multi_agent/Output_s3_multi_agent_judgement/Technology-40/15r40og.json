    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the situation by considering both perspectives. It recognizes that Billet Labs might have been coerced or unaware of the NDA implications, which is a nuanced and fair approach. It also challenges the blanket accusation against LTT, which is important for maintaining neutrality. The reasoning is thoughtful and balanced, giving credit to both sides without taking a definitive stance on who is entirely correct.",

        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the situation and the possibility of coercion or lack of awareness on Billet Labs' part, which is a balanced approach. However, it downplays the argument that LTT is scummy for selling the video, which is a strong claim made by multiple participants. The mediation fails to adequately address the ethical and legal implications of LTT's actions, and the score should reflect that it does not fully counter the negative bias argument against LTT.",

It recognizes the possibility that Billet Labs may have been coerced or unaware of the NDA implications, which is a nuanced approach. However, it also challenges the strong claim that LTT is scummy for selling the video, which is a valid point as the mediation does not take a definitive stance on who is entirely correct.
