        "rationale": "The mediation output fails to provide a clear resolution or judgment on which side is correct. It instead presents both perspectives as equally valid, which is overly neutral and does not address the underlying issues or provide a reasoned conclusion. The conversation contains significant debate and conflicting viewpoints, but the mediation does not adequately analyze the arguments or provide a fair assessment of the merits of each side. The lack of a definitive judgment undermines the effectiveness of the mediation.",
