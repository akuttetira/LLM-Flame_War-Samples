        "rationale": "The mediation effectively highlights the complexity of the leadership structure and the potential issues with blurred authority lines. It acknowledges the concerns about Linus potentially undermining Terren's role as CEO, which is a key point in the discussion. The reasoning is balanced and considers the implications of the structure on authority and decision-making, making it a fair and thoughtful assessment.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the leadership structure but fails to address the core issue of authority and power dynamics. It suggests that Linus overruling Terren is more problematic, but this overlooks the potential for abuse of power and the importance of clear boundaries in leadership roles. The mediation also does not fully consider the implications of the structure on the company's operations and employee morale.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively addresses the key issue of authority and power dynamics in the leadership structure. It correctly identifies that the potential for Linus to overrule Terren as CEO is more problematic than the reverse, as it undermines Terren's role and creates confusion in the hierarchy. The reasoning is balanced and acknowledges the complexity of the situation without oversimplifying it.",
