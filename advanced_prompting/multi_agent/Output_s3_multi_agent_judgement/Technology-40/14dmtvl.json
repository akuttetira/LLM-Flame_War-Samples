    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the valid concerns about reducing electronic waste and sustainability, which is a key point in favor of the EU regulation. It also correctly points out that the opposing argument is overly broad, as it claims EU regulations will stifle innovation and consumer choice without considering the potential benefits of user-replaceable batteries. The reasoning is balanced and recognizes the complexity of the issue.",

        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges that both sides have valid points but leans towards the argument for user-replaceable batteries. However, it fails to adequately address the complexity of the issue, such as the trade-offs between repairability, design, and environmental impact. The judgment is somewhat balanced but lacks depth in evaluating the specific arguments and potential consequences of the regulation.",

        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced view by recognizing the validity of both sides' arguments. It acknowledges the sustainability benefits of user-replaceable batteries while also noting the opposing argument's overgeneralization. However, it could have delved deeper into the specific trade-offs and potential consequences of the regulation, offering a more comprehensive analysis.",
