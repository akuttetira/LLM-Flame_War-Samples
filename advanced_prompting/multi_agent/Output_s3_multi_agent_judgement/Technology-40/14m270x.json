        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the situation and provides a balanced assessment by recognizing the validity of both perspectives. It highlights the argument about the protest being pointless and users getting bored as more convincing, which is a fair evaluation of the arguments presented. The reasoning is clear and does not take an extreme stance, making it a reasonable judgment.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation fails to address the complexity of the issue and oversimplifies the arguments. It dismisses the claim that the protest was a 'gigantic waste' and that users left due to boredom, while not adequately countering the argument that the protest was a 'tribal issue' and that some users were 'brainwashed.' The mediation also doesn't consider the possibility that both factors could be at play. The reasoning is flawed because it doesn't engage with the nuances of the debate and assumes one side is more convincing without proper analysis.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the complexity of the situation by recognizing that both perspectives have merit. It provides a balanced assessment by highlighting the argument that the protest being pointless and users getting bored is more convincing, while also noting the other perspective. This approach is fair and reasonable, reflecting the nuanced discussion in the conversation.",
