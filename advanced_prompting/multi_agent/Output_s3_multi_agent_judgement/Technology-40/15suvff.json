        "rationale": "The mediation fails to address the core issues of accountability and responsibility. It overlooks the significant criticisms towards LMG's handling of the prototype and the workplace culture issues, which are central to the discussion. The mediation also does not adequately consider the broader context of the company's repeated mistakes and the community's response, which are crucial for a fair assessment. The judgment is too neutral and does not account for the systemic failures and the need for real change.",
