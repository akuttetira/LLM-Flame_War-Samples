        "rationale": "The mediation incorrectly identifies the 'right' party in the conversation. The user, Terrible_Cut_3336, uses harsh and personal insults, which are not just disrespectful but also inappropriate in a public forum. The mediation fails to recognize the severity of the personal attacks and the lack of constructive dialogue. The judgment is not neutral and shows a bias towards the other side, which is not fair or effective.",
