        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the validity of the concerns raised by the user about comment deletion, recognizing the possibility of intentional action by the company. It also addresses the counterargument by suggesting it could be a YouTube glitch, showing a balanced consideration of both perspectives. This approach reflects a fair and nuanced judgment that gives weight to the user's experience while not dismissing the alternative explanation.",

        "rationale": "The mediation fails to adequately address the core issue of whether the comment deletion was intentional or a technical glitch. It leans towards justifying the accusers without sufficiently countering the argument that the issue might be a simple YouTube error. The reasoning is somewhat biased towards the accusers without providing a balanced assessment of the evidence presented.",

        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced assessment by acknowledging both perspectives: it recognizes the user's concern about intentional comment deletion while also considering the possibility of a YouTube glitch. This approach shows an effort to understand both sides without clearly favoring one over the other, which is fair and reasonable given the limited information.",
