        "rationale": "The mediation message is somewhat vague and lacks specific guidance on how to handle the content and tone of the conversation. It mentions keeping the discussion civil and focused, but does not address the specific issues raised in the conversation, such as the use of emojis, the context of abuse, or the potential for triggering content.
