        "rationale": "The mediation message is somewhat vague and lacks specific guidance on how to address the complex dynamics discussed in the conversation. It suggests focusing on specific issues and avoiding assumptions, but does not clearly outline what those issues are or how to navigate the emotional and ethical challenges presented.
