        "rationale": "The mediation message acknowledges the community's support and focuses on the OP's healing journey and holding abusers accountable. However, it is somewhat vague in its guidance and does not explicitly address the need for a more respectful and supportive tone in the discussion. It also fails to directly address the concerns raised about the statute of limitations and the importance of time in healing.",

It maintains a supportive tone and avoids contentious topics like the statute of limitations, which is appropriate given the sensitive nature of the discussion.
