        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and lacks specificity in addressing the underlying issues in the conversation. It fails to acknowledge the complex dynamics between different parent figures and the potential for stigmatization. The message is overly general and does not provide clear guidance on how to navigate the discussion constructively. Additionally, it does not address the controversy around the term 'father' and the debate over who qualifies as a parent.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message effectively addresses the core issue of avoiding stigmatization or excessive praise for single parents. It promotes inclusivity and acknowledges the challenges faced by all parents, which is appropriate given the conversation's context. However, it could have been more specific in addressing the debate around the term 'father' and the differing opinions on parental responsibility. The message is clear and neutral, but could have provided more guidance on navigating the discussion constructively.",
