        "rationale": "The mediation output is overly vague and lacks specific guidance on how to proceed or address the issues raised in the conversation. It does not provide actionable steps or clear direction for the participants to move forward in a constructive manner. The message is general and does not address the specific concerns or dynamics present in the discussion, which includes themes of parental control, privacy, and emotional trauma. As a result, it fails to effectively steer the conversation towards a more productive and supportive direction.",
