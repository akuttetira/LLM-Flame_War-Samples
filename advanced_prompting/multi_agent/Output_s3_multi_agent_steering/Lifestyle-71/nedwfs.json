        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and lacks specific guidance on how to address the issues raised in the conversation. It is overly general and does not provide clear direction on how to handle the dynamics of over-explaining, invalidation, and the impact of family expectations on behavior. The message fails to acknowledge the specific concerns raised by users and does not offer a constructive path forward.",
