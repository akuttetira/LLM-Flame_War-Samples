        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and lacks specific guidance on how to address the issues raised in the conversation. It fails to provide clear direction on balancing accountability with nuance, and does not address the specific concerns about cancel culture, the role of media, or the complexities of human behavior in the context of online discourse. The message is overly general and does not effectively steer the conversation towards a more constructive or neutral discussion.",
