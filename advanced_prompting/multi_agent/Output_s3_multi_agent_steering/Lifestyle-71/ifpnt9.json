    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message provides useful information about hotlines and resources, but it lacks specific guidance on how to safely escape a dangerous situation. It is too vague and does not address the immediate need for action in a life-threatening scenario. The message also fails to acknowledge the severity of the situation and the potential for harm, which is critical in a case involving possible female genital mutilation. Additionally, it does not provide clear steps on how to contact authorities or seek help in a situation where the person may be locked in a house.",

However, it could have been more specific about immediate actions to take if the person is in a locked house or at risk of harm, which the negative judge pointed out. Overall, it is a strong and effective mediation message.",
