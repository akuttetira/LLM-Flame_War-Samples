        "rationale": "The mediation message acknowledges the parody aspect and comments on the dairy industry's intentions. However, it is overly simplistic and fails to address the deeper issues raised in the conversation, such as the humor of the joke, the potential for misinterpretation, and the broader context of the parody. It also lacks specificity in addressing the nuances of the discussion, such as the confusion among viewers and the debate around the term 'wood milk'. The message is too vague to be effective in guiding the conversation towards a more informed or constructive discussion.",
