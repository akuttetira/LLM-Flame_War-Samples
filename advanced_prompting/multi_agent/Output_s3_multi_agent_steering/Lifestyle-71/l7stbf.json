    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message effectively steers the conversation towards supporting the original poster (OP) and their decision to set boundaries. It acknowledges the complexity of personal comfort levels with physical touch and shifts the focus away from debates about what is 'normal' or 'acceptable'. The message is neutral, respectful, and encourages a more constructive dialogue around autonomy and boundaries, which aligns with the goal of mediation. It avoids taking sides and instead promotes a supportive environment for the OP.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is somewhat vague and lacks specific guidance on how to move forward in the conversation. It mentions focusing on supporting OP and their decision to set boundaries, but does not provide clear direction on how to do so effectively. The message also fails to address the underlying issues of consent, autonomy, and the inappropriate comments made by some users. While it is neutral in tone, it is too general and does not offer actionable steps to improve the conversation.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message effectively acknowledges the complexity of personal boundaries and shifts the focus to supporting the OP's autonomy. It avoids taking sides and promotes a respectful, constructive dialogue. While it is slightly vague in its guidance, it successfully steers the conversation away from contentious debates about 'normal' behavior and towards a more supportive tone. The message is well-worded, neutral, and aligns with the goal of mediation.",
