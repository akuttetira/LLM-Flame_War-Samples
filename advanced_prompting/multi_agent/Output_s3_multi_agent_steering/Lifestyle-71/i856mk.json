        "rationale": "The mediation message is effective in steering the conversation towards a more constructive and collaborative direction. It acknowledges the potential for differing parenting styles and encourages sharing personal experiences, which can foster understanding and learning. The message is neutral, respectful, and aims to de-escalate the tension present in the original conversation.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is too vague and lacks specific guidance on how to address the conflict. It suggests sharing stories and learning from perspectives, but does not address the underlying issues of personal attacks, accusations of narcissism, and the emotional tone of the conversation. The message fails to provide a clear path for constructive dialogue and does not acknowledge the negative bias in the conversation. It is too general and does not steer the conversation toward a more neutral, respectful, and effective discussion.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message effectively acknowledges differing perspectives and encourages a more constructive dialogue by suggesting shared experiences. It is neutral, respectful, and aims to de-escalate the tension present in the original conversation. However, it could have been more specific in addressing the personal attacks and accusations of narcissism that were present. The message is well-worded and sounds like it could be from a user rather than an AI.",
