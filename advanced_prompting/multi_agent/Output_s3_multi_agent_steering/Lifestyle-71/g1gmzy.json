        "rationale": "The mediation output is too vague and lacks specific guidance on how to support each other in healing journeys. It does not address the emotional and psychological complexities discussed in the conversation, nor does it offer actionable steps or a clear direction for the discussion. The message is overly general and does not effectively steer the conversation towards meaningful dialogue or mutual support.",
