        "rationale": "The mediation effectively emphasizes empathy and validation, which are crucial in a sensitive context. It acknowledges the personal and painful nature of the OP's experience and encourages a supportive environment. The message is neutral, respectful, and aims to steer the conversation towards empathy rather than debate, which is appropriate given the context.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is somewhat vague and lacks specific guidance on how to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding. It does not address the potential for conflict or the need for clear boundaries, which are important in a sensitive discussion. The message is too general and does not provide actionable steps to ensure the conversation remains supportive and respectful.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the sensitive and personal nature of the OP's experience, emphasizing empathy and validation. It encourages a supportive environment by focusing on understanding rather than debate. The message is respectful and appropriate for the context, though it could have been more specific in guiding the conversation towards empathy. The positive judge's rationale is well-reasoned and accurate, while the negative judge's critique is somewhat overly critical of the mediation's lack of specificity, which is reasonable but not entirely justified given the context.",
