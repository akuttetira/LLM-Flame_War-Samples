        "rationale": "The mediation message acknowledges the OP's perspective and the importance of respecting personal boundaries, which is appropriate given the context. It promotes understanding and respect for differences in communication styles without being overly prescriptive. The message is neutral, empathetic, and aligns with the conversation's themes. However, it could have been more specific in addressing the nuances of the discussion about language and triggers.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is vague and lacks specific guidance on how to respect boundaries or handle triggers. It fails to address the core issue of the OP's need for clarity and respect in communication, and it does not provide actionable steps or clear expectations for others to follow. The message is too general and does not effectively steer the conversation toward a more constructive or empathetic direction.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message effectively acknowledges the OP's perspective and the importance of respecting personal boundaries, which is crucial in this context. It promotes understanding and respect for differences in communication styles without being overly prescriptive. The message is empathetic and aligns with the conversation's themes, though it could have been slightly more specific in addressing the nuances of language and triggers. It strikes a balance between being general enough to be inclusive and specific enough to convey the intended message.",
