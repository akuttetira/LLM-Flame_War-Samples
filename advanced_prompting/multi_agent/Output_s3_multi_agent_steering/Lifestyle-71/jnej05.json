        "rationale": "The mediation message acknowledges the uniqueness of individual experiences and emphasizes supporting each other's journeys. However, it is somewhat vague in its guidance and does not explicitly address the need for empathy or the complexity of grief and trauma. The message is neutral but lacks specific direction on how to handle the emotional and psychological aspects of the conversation, which could be more effective in a negative bias context.",
