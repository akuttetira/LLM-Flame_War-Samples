        "rationale": "The mediation message is somewhat effective in promoting a supportive environment, but it lacks specificity and fails to address the core issues in the conversation. It is vague in its guidance and does not clearly outline what constitutes policing or how to handle triggering content. Additionally, it does not provide actionable steps for participants to follow, which reduces its effectiveness in guiding the conversation towards a more supportive and empathetic direction.",
