It acknowledges the shared goal of wanting what's best for children while encouraging a focus on teaching responsibility and emotional regulation rather than punitive measures.

        "rationale": "The mediation message is somewhat vague and lacks specific guidance on how to approach the discussion with empathy and understanding. It suggests sharing strategies for teaching responsibility and emotional regulation, but does not provide concrete examples or actionable steps. The message also fails to address the underlying issues of parental support and understanding of mental health, which are central to the conversation. Additionally, it does not clearly define what constitutes appropriate behavior in the context of the support group.",
