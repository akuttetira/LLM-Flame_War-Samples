        "rationale": "The mediation message is overly vague and lacks specific strategies for addressing the issues discussed. It makes a general statement about reframing upbringing but does not provide actionable steps or guidance for the individuals experiencing abuse. The message is too abstract and does not address the emotional pain or the need for support in healing processes. It also fails to acknowledge the severity of the situations described and does not offer practical advice for moving forward.",
