        "rationale": "The mediation message is somewhat vague and lacks specific guidance on how to move forward constructively. It mentions focusing on supporting OP and acknowledging complexity, but it doesn't address the underlying conflict or provide clear steps to de-escalate the situation. The message also fails to directly address the personal attacks and the need for mutual respect in the discussion. While it is somewhat neutral, it lacks the specificity and actionable steps needed to be effective in this context.",
