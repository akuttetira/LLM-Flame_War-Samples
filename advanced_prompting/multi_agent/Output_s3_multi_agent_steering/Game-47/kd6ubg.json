        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and lacks specific guidance on how to address the debate about the PS5 controller's novelty and relevance to older consoles. It fails to provide clear direction on what the conversation should focus on or how to move forward constructively. The statement 'focus on the actual feature and how it works' is too general and does not address the underlying conflict or provide actionable steps for resolution.",
