    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is somewhat effective in trying to steer the conversation towards discussing specific changes, but it lacks clarity and specificity in addressing the core issues raised by the players. It fails to acknowledge the specific grievances mentioned in the conversation, such as the game's monetization practices, the impact of recent updates on player experience, and the overall lack of engagement. The message is too vague and does not provide a clear direction for the discussion, which could have led to a more constructive and focused conversation.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the frustration and attempts to redirect the conversation towards constructive solutions. It is respectful and neutral, encouraging a discussion about specific changes that could improve the game. However, it could have been more specific in addressing the core issues raised, such as monetization practices and game design flaws. The message is well-crafted and sounds like it could be from a user rather than an AI.",
