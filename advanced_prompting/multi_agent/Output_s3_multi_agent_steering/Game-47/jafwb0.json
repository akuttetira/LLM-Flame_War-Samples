        "rationale": "The mediation message effectively steers the conversation towards discussing the actual games and their potential, which is a positive approach. It encourages participants to focus on the games themselves rather than getting bogged down in platform-related debates. The message is concise, friendly, and aims to foster a more constructive dialogue. It also sounds like a genuine user trying to guide the conversation rather than an AI, which is a strong point in favor of its effectiveness and neutrality.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and lacks specificity. It suggests a general shift in focus but does not clearly address the specific points of contention in the conversation. The discussion revolves around the quality of PS5 launch titles, the comparison between new and old games, and the perception of game quality. The mediation does not provide concrete guidance on how to move forward or resolve the disagreements, making it ineffective in steering the conversation towards a more constructive direction.",
