        "rationale": "The mediation effectively shifts the focus from the technical discussion about subtitles and captions to the content of the message itself. It encourages participants to evaluate the value of the content rather than getting stuck in a debate about terminology. The message is neutral, concise, and steers the conversation towards a more constructive direction without imposing a viewpoint.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and lacks specificity. It suggests focusing on the 'actual message' but does not clarify what that message is or how to determine its worth. The mediation also fails to address the ongoing conflict between users regarding terminology (subtitles vs. captions) and the emotional tone of the discussion. It does not provide a clear path forward or guide the conversation towards a more constructive direction.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively addresses the core issue by shifting the focus from the terminology debate to the content of the message. It acknowledges the ongoing discussion about subtitles and captions but redirects the conversation to evaluate the message's value. The message is neutral, concise, and provides a clear direction without imposing a viewpoint, which helps to calm the conversation and encourage more constructive dialogue.",
