    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is somewhat vague and lacks specific guidance on how to address the issues discussed. It mentions separating facts from emotions and focusing on respectful conversation, but it does not provide clear steps or direction on how to do so. The message is also somewhat dismissive of the strong emotions and opinions expressed in the conversation, which could be seen as ineffective in addressing the underlying concerns. The mediation does not effectively address the specific issues of clickbait, misinformation, and the impact of the leaks on the gaming community.",
