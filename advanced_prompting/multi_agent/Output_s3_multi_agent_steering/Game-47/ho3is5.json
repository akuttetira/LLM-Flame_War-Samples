        "rationale": "The mediation effectively steers the conversation towards discussing specific mechanics and narrative choices, which is relevant to the discussion. It encourages a deeper exploration of how player agency serves the story and the implications for the player-character relationship. The message is neutral, focused, and invites further discussion without taking sides.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is somewhat vague and lacks specific direction. It mentions focusing on mechanics and narrative choices, but doesn't clearly address the key points of contention in the conversation, such as the player's role in the story, the ethical implications of actions, and the debate over player agency versus narrative control. The mediation is too general and doesn't provide a clear path for the discussion to move forward effectively.",
