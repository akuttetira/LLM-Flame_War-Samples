        "rationale": "The mediation message acknowledges the discussion about optimization differences between platforms and suggests learning from each other's strengths. It is neutral, concise, and encourages a constructive dialogue without taking sides. However, it could be more specific in addressing the technical aspects of the conversation and could have provided more direct guidance to steer the discussion towards a more productive direction.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is too vague and lacks specificity. It fails to address the core issues discussed in the conversation, such as optimization differences between consoles and PCs, the role of hardware vs. software, and the impact of settings on performance and visual quality. The message is overly general and does not provide any concrete guidance or steer the conversation towards a more productive direction.",
