        "rationale": "The mediation suggests focusing on mechanics and distinguishing between bugs and exploitable features. However, it lacks specific guidance on how to differentiate between the two, which is essential for effective mediation. The message is vague and does not provide clear steps or criteria for evaluating what constitutes a bug versus an exploit. This vagueness reduces its effectiveness in steering the conversation towards a productive resolution.",
