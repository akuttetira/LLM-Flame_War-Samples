        "rationale": "The mediation message is somewhat vague and lacks specific guidance on how to move forward in the conversation. It suggests focusing on understanding each other's viewpoints but does not provide clear steps or strategies for doing so. The message also avoids direct confrontation with the underlying issues of transphobia and internalized homophobia, which are central to the discussion. Additionally, the use of terms like 'TERFs' and 'transphobes' may not be neutral or inclusive, depending on the context and the participants' perspectives.",
