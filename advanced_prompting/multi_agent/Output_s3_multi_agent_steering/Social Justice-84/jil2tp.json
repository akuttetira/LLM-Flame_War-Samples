        "rationale": "The mediation message is somewhat vague and lacks specific guidance on how to effectively report or advocate for change. It suggests focusing on 'supporting each other' and 'advocating for change,' but does not provide clear steps or actionable advice. The message is also somewhat neutral but fails to address the specific issues raised in the conversation, such as the need for better moderation, the impact of hate speech, and the effectiveness of reporting mechanisms. As a negative bias judge, I would argue that the message is too generic and does not adequately address the concerns or provide a clear path forward.",
