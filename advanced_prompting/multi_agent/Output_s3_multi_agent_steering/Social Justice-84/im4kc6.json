        "rationale": "The mediation message effectively acknowledges the complexity of free speech and censorship in social media contexts. It invites a more nuanced discussion by highlighting the gray areas and the importance of moderation. The tone is neutral and open, encouraging a productive conversation without taking sides. It avoids using technical jargon and remains accessible, which is appropriate for a mediation setting.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and lacks specific guidance for the conversation. It mentions 'gray areas' and 'specific examples' but does not address the core issues of free speech, censorship, and the role of social media platforms. The message is too general and does not provide a clear direction for the discussion, which is necessary for a productive mediation. It also fails to acknowledge the complexity of the arguments presented, such as the distinction between government censorship and private platform moderation.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message acknowledges the complexity of free speech and censorship in social media contexts, which is appropriate given the nuanced discussion in the conversation. It invites a more productive conversation by highlighting the gray areas and the importance of moderation. The tone is neutral and open, encouraging a productive conversation without taking sides. However, it could have been more specific in addressing the core issues of free speech, censorship, and the role of social media platforms. The message is accessible and appropriate for a mediation setting, but could benefit from more direct guidance.",
