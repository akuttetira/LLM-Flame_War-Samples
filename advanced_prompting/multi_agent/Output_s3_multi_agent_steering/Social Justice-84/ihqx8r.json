This approach encourages a more balanced discussion that goes beyond blaming users alone, which is effective in steering the conversation towards a more comprehensive understanding of the issue.

It fails to provide clear direction on how to move forward, address the toxic behavior, or hold Reddit accountable for its moderation policies.
