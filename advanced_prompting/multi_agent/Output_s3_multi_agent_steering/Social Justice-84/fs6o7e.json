        "rationale": "The mediation effectively steers the conversation towards a more constructive and neutral discussion by focusing on specific examples and behaviors rather than broad accusations. It encourages a factual analysis of what constitutes transphobia and how to address it, which is both fair and effective. The tone is neutral and user-like, avoiding the pitfalls of being overly prescriptive or biased.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is too vague and lacks specificity. It suggests focusing on 'specific examples and behaviors' but does not provide clear criteria for identifying transphobia or guide the conversation towards actionable steps. The message also fails to address the core disagreement between the participants regarding the nature of GenderCritical and itsafetish subreddits. It does not encourage a balanced discussion or provide a framework for evaluating the claims made by both sides.",
