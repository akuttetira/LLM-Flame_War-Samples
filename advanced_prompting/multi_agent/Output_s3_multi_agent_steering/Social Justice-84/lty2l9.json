However, it is vague in its approach and does not explicitly address the potential for personal attacks or the need for respectful dialogue. It lacks specific guidance on how to correct misinformation without engaging in harmful behavior, which is crucial in a context where sensitive topics are discussed. The message is also too general and does not provide clear steps or boundaries for constructive conversation.",
