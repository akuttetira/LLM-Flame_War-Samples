        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to address the discussion by referencing the historical context of the Declaration of Independence. However, it lacks specificity in guiding the conversation towards a more constructive direction. It fails to address the core issues of police conduct and systemic racism, and instead shifts focus to a historical document. The mediation is somewhat vague in its approach and does not clearly outline how to move forward in a respectful and productive manner.",
