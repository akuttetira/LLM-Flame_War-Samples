    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is somewhat vague and lacks specificity in addressing the concerns raised in the conversation. It suggests focusing on examples and experiences but does not clearly define what constitutes a 'specific example' or how to handle the discussions around mod demographics and motivations. The message also fails to directly address the underlying tensions and assumptions about race, moderation, and allyship that are central to the conversation. While it aims to promote focus, it does not provide actionable guidance or clarify the boundaries of acceptable discourse.",
