    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message attempts to clarify the distinction between making fun of the police and making fun of George Floyd's death. However, it is somewhat vague in its guidance and does not explicitly address the nuances of the discussion. It also lacks specific direction on how to separate the two topics or what the focus should be on the specific meme. The message is neutral but could have been more precise in steering the conversation toward a constructive resolution.",
