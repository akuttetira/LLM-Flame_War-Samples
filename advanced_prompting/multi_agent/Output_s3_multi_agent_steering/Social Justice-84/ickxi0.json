        "rationale": "The mediation message is effective in steering the conversation towards more specific examples of problematic behavior rather than generalizing about entire groups. It acknowledges the complexity of the issue and encourages a more constructive dialogue by focusing on concrete instances. The tone is neutral and fair, avoiding any bias or strong opinions, which aligns with the goal of a mediator.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is vague and lacks specific guidance on how to address the issues raised. It suggests focusing on specific examples but does not provide clear direction on what those examples should be or how to handle them. The message is also overly general and does not address the specific concerns about the subreddits' toxic environment and the need for accountability.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message effectively acknowledges the complexity of the issue and suggests a shift towards specific examples, which is a constructive approach. It maintains a neutral tone and avoids taking sides, which is appropriate for a mediator. However, it could have been more specific about what examples to focus on, given the context of the conversation.",
