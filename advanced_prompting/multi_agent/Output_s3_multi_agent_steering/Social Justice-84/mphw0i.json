It acknowledges the potential for outrage while suggesting a solution-oriented approach.

        "rationale": "The mediation message is overly vague and lacks specific guidance on how to address the issues raised in the conversation. It suggests focusing on 'what makes a good Q&A subreddit' but doesn't provide actionable steps or address the underlying concerns about the subreddits' content and behavior. The message also fails to acknowledge the validity of the criticisms made about the subreddit's nature and the users' beliefs, which could be seen as dismissive or ineffective in resolving the conflict.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message effectively addresses the tension in the conversation by encouraging a shift from personal attacks to a focus on the subreddit's purpose and improvement. It acknowledges the potential for outrage but redirects the discussion towards constructive solutions. The tone is neutral and encouraging, which is appropriate for a mediation context. However, it could have been more specific in addressing the core issues raised about the subreddit's content and user behavior.",
