        "rationale": "The mediation message acknowledges the potential for disagreement without escalation and suggests focusing on behaviors rather than people, which aligns with the conversation's themes of countering harassment and trolling. It is neutral, concise, and offers a practical suggestion that could help guide the conversation towards more constructive interactions. However, it could be more specific to the context of the discussion about harassment brigades and psychological warfare.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message is vague and lacks specific guidance on how to avoid escalation. It suggests focusing on 'specific behaviors' but does not provide concrete strategies or examples. The message is too general and does not address the core issue of deplatforming or counter-strategies against harassment brigades. It also fails to acknowledge the complexity of the discussion and the need for a more structured approach.",
