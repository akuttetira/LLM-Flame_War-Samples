        "rationale": "The mediation message is somewhat effective in encouraging a more nuanced discussion, but it lacks specific guidance on how to separate facts from emotions and does not address the underlying issues or complexities of the conversation. The message is too vague and does not provide clear steps or direction for the participants to follow, which reduces its effectiveness in guiding the conversation towards a constructive outcome.",

It is empathetic and aims to guide the conversation towards a constructive direction. However, it is somewhat vague and lacks specific guidance on how to separate facts from emotions or address the underlying issues.
