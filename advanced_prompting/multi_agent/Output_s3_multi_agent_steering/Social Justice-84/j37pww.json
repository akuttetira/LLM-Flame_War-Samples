        "rationale": "The mediation message is somewhat vague and lacks specific guidance on how to address the conversation's content. It suggests separating 'signal from the noise' but does not provide clear direction on what constitutes 'signal' or 'noise' in this context. Additionally, the message does not directly address the specific points made in the conversation, such as the discussion around r/Conservative, Kyle Rittenhouse, and the broader political and social tensions. This vagueness may not effectively steer the conversation towards a constructive dialogue.",
