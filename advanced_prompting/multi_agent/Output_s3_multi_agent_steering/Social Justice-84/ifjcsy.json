    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively identifies the common concern about the 'shoot to kill' doctrine in US police force and suggests focusing on specific examples. It is concise, relevant, and encourages a more concrete discussion without getting bogged down in philosophical debates. The tone is neutral and facilitates a constructive conversation.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and lacks specificity. It suggests focusing on examples but does not provide clear guidance on what examples to consider or how to approach the discussion. The message is too general and does not address the core issues of the debate, such as the justification for lethal force, the role of race, and the cultural context of police use of force in the US. The mediation fails to steer the conversation towards a more effective resolution of the underlying concerns.",
