        "rationale": "The mediation message is overly vague and lacks specific guidance on how to handle the extreme and harmful content present in the conversation. It does not address the explicit threats of violence or the promotion of hate, and it fails to provide clear boundaries or consequences for such behavior. The message is too general and does not effectively steer the conversation towards a more constructive or respectful direction.",
