        "rationale": "The mediation message is somewhat vague and lacks specific guidance on how to address the issues raised. It mentions focusing on 'specific issues at hand' but does not clearly outline what those issues are or how to approach them. Additionally, it avoids directly addressing the concerns about the mods' handling of the post and the lack of admin support, which are central to the discussion. The message also does not encourage a constructive dialogue or provide actionable steps for resolution.",
