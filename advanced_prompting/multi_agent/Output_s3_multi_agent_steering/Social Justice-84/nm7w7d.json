        "rationale": "The mediation effectively shifts the focus from the hate speech to the process of reporting, which is a positive and constructive approach. It avoids taking sides and instead encourages a discussion on improving the reporting system. The message is neutral, user-like, and steers the conversation towards a solution-oriented path.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and fails to address the specific issue of hate speech in the conversation. It shifts the focus to making reporting easier rather than confronting the harmful content directly. This lack of clarity and directness reduces its effectiveness in addressing the problem at hand.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively addresses the issue of hate speech by shifting the focus to the reporting process without directly confronting the harmful content. It maintains a neutral tone, encourages constructive dialogue, and steers the conversation towards a solution-oriented path. The message sounds like it could be from a user rather than an AI, as it is concise, empathetic, and aims to facilitate a productive discussion.",
