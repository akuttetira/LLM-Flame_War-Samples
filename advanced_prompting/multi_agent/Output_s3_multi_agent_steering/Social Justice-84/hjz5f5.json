    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is somewhat vague and lacks specific guidance on how to address the issue of hate speech in the context of the conversation. It suggests focusing on examples but does not provide clear steps or criteria for identifying problematic content. Additionally, the mediation is too general and does not address the specific concerns raised about the 'I Hate N*****s' post flair and the discussion around racism as humor. The message also fails to clearly define what constitutes hate speech or how to handle it effectively.",
