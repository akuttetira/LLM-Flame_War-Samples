    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation message attempts to foster collaboration by focusing on shared goals, but it lacks specificity and fails to address the core issues of transphobia and the role of TERFs in online spaces. It is vague and does not provide clear guidance on how to move forward or resolve the conflicts mentioned in the conversation. The message is also overly optimistic and does not acknowledge the complexity and hostility present in the discussion.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the passionate disagreement and the shared concern for trans people's rights, while encouraging collaboration despite differences. It maintains a neutral tone and focuses on a common goal, which is important in a discussion with strong opposing views. However, it could have been more specific in addressing the issues of TERFs and transphobia mentioned in the conversation. The message is well-crafted and sounds like it could be from a user rather than an AI.",
