        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and lacks specificity in addressing the concerns raised in the conversation. It fails to acknowledge the harmful nature of the conspiracy theories discussed, such as QAnon and Pizzagate, and does not provide a clear path for constructive dialogue. The message is overly general and does not steer the conversation towards a more neutral or informative direction.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the historical context of conspiracy theories and encourages a discussion on their evolution, which is relevant to the conversation. It maintains a neutral tone and avoids taking sides, which is appropriate given the sensitive nature of the topics discussed. However, it could have been more specific in addressing the harmful aspects of QAnon and Pizzagate. Overall, it is a reasonable and respectful steering message.",
