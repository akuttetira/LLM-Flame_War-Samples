        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and lacks specificity in addressing the core issues presented in the conversation. It fails to acknowledge the harmful rhetoric and potential misogyny present in the discussion about incels and the objectification of women. The message is overly general and does not provide clear guidance or resources for addressing the specific concerns raised. It also does not effectively steer the conversation towards a more constructive or neutral direction.",
