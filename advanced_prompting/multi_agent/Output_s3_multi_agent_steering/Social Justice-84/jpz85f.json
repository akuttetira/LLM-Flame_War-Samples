        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and lacks specific guidance on how to address the issues of hate speech and misinformation. It fails to provide clear steps or considerations for finding a middle ground, which is necessary for effective mediation. The response is too general and does not address the specific concerns raised in the conversation.",
