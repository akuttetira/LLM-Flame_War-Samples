        "rationale": "The mediation message is somewhat vague and lacks specific guidance on how to handle the contentious discussion around the N-word. It emphasizes respect and avoiding personal attacks, which is good, but it does not address the core issue of the debate around the N-word's usage, cultural context, and the differing viewpoints on its appropriateness. The message is too general and does not provide clear direction on how to navigate the complex and sensitive topic at hand.",
