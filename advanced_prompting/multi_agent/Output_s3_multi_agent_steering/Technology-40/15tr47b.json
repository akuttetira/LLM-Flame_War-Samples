        "rationale": "The mediation message acknowledges the evolution of the discussion and suggests a positive takeaway about learning from the conversation. It is neutral and does not take sides, which is appropriate for a mediation context. However, it is somewhat vague and does not directly address the specific issues or provide clear guidance for moving forward. It could have been more effective by acknowledging the complexity of the situation and offering a more concrete suggestion for improvement.",

It fails to address the core issues of accountability, company culture, and the specific incident involving the prototype. The message is too general and does not provide a clear path for the conversation to become more constructive or focused.",
