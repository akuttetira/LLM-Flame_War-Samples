        "rationale": "The mediation message is somewhat effective in encouraging a constructive conversation, but it lacks specificity and fails to address the core issues in the conversation. It is vague in its guidance and does not provide clear direction on how to separate personal opinions from factual discussions. The message is too general and does not effectively steer the conversation toward a more neutral or fact-based discussion.",

It maintains a neutral tone and provides a clear direction for the conversation to be more productive. The message is well-crafted and sounds like it could be from a user rather than an AI.",
