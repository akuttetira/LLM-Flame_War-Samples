        "rationale": "The mediation message is vague and lacks specific guidance on how to address the issues raised. It suggests focusing on 'facts and the impact of Louis' content on his audience,' but does not provide clear steps or criteria for evaluating the content or the arguments presented. The message also fails to address the specific concerns about Louis' content, the potential for personal attacks, and the need for constructive dialogue. The response is too general and does not effectively steer the conversation towards a more productive direction.",
