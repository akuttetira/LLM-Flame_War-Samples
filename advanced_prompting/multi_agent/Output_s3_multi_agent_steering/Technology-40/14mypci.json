        "rationale": "The mediation effectively steers the conversation back to the specific topic of Apollo and Reddit's API issues, which is the main subject of the discussion. It acknowledges the passion in the conversation and asks for a focus on the specifics, which is a fair and constructive approach. The message is neutral, concise, and does not impose a personal opinion, making it sound like a true user rather than an AI.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is somewhat vague and lacks specific guidance on how to focus the discussion on the specifics of Apollo and Reddit's API. It fails to address the underlying issues raised in the conversation, such as the pricing model, timeline for changes, and the impact on third-party developers. The message is too general and does not effectively steer the conversation towards the key points of contention.",
