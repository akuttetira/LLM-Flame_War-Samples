        "rationale": "The mediation message is somewhat vague and lacks specific guidance on how to approach the discussion more effectively. It mentions being mindful of the impact of actions but doesn't offer concrete steps or address the nuances of the situation, such as the differing perspectives on responsibility and the role of social media. The message is too general and doesn't provide a clear path for constructive dialogue.",
