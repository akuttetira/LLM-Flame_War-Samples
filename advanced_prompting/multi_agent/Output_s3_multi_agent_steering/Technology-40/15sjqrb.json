        "rationale": "The mediation message is somewhat effective in encouraging participants to focus on facts rather than speculation. However, it is vague in its guidance, as it does not clearly define what specific evidence is needed or how to balance financial improvement with values. The message also lacks a clear directive on how to proceed or what the next steps should be, which reduces its effectiveness in steering the conversation towards a constructive resolution.",
