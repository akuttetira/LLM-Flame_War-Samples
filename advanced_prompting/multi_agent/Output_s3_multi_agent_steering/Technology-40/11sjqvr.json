It is neutral, fair, and aims to steer the conversation towards a more constructive and positive direction.

It suggests focusing on positive aspects but does not provide clear direction on how to navigate the conflicting viewpoints or the specific issues raised. The message is too general and does not effectively steer the conversation towards a constructive resolution.",
