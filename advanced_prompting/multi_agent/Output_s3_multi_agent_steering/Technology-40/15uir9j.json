        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and lacks specificity in addressing the core issues of the conversation. It fails to acknowledge the specific concerns raised about the lack of investigation two years ago and the potential for misinformation. The message is overly general and does not provide a clear path forward or address the underlying tensions in the discussion. It also does not take a neutral stance but rather shifts the focus to the company's current actions without fully addressing the criticisms of past actions.",
