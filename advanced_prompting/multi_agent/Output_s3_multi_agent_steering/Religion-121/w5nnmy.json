    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively highlights the key issue in the conversation: the contradiction between personal experiences and empirical evidence. It acknowledges the argument that personal experiences may not be reliable when they conflict with factual outcomes, while also addressing the theological implications of divine will and Satan's role. The message is concise, neutral, and steers the conversation toward a more logical and evidence-based discussion without taking sides.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and lacks specific guidance on how to address the underlying issues in the conversation. It fails to clearly define the terms 'personal experiences,' 'God's will,' and 'Satan's power,' which are central to the debate. Additionally, it does not provide a structured approach to resolving the conflict between the participants' perspectives, making it ineffective in steering the conversation toward a constructive resolution.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively identifies the core conflict between personal experiences and empirical evidence, while addressing the theological implications without taking a side. It provides a clear, neutral direction to focus on logical and evidence-based discussion, which helps to calm the heated exchange. The message is well-structured and avoids unnecessary jargon, making it sound like a genuine user response rather than an AI-generated one.",
