        "rationale": "The mediation effectively highlights the key point of the discussion, which is the burden of proof in theological claims. It acknowledges the complexity of the debate without taking a definitive stance, which maintains neutrality. The message is concise, clear, and steering the conversation towards a more constructive and balanced discussion. It avoids overly technical language and stays relevant to the core issue at hand.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation output is somewhat vague and lacks specific guidance on how to address the discussion effectively. It mentions the burden of proof but does not clearly explain how to navigate the debate between theism and atheism, nor does it address the specific concerns raised in the conversation. The statement is somewhat neutral but fails to provide actionable steps or clarify the issues at hand, making it less effective in steering the conversation towards a constructive resolution.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively addresses the core issue of burden of proof in theological claims while maintaining a neutral tone. It acknowledges the complexity of the debate without taking a definitive stance, which is important in a discussion with strong opposing views. The message is clear, concise, and steers the conversation towards a more balanced and constructive discussion. However, it could have been slightly more specific in explaining how to navigate the debate between theism and atheism.",
