    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively highlights the key point that taxing religious organizations like other entities could prevent abuse and corruption, which is a central issue in the discussion. It acknowledges the complexity of the argument without taking a definitive stance, which maintains neutrality. The message is clear, concise, and directly addresses the core of the debate, making it effective in steering the conversation towards a more balanced perspective.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation output fails to address the core issues of religious exemption and taxation effectively. It is vague and does not clearly present a balanced view of the arguments on both sides. The statement 'the latter ignores the potential for abuse and corruption' is too general and does not provide a clear, neutral perspective on the debate. The mediation lacks specific guidance on how to resolve the conflict or move forward in the discussion.",
