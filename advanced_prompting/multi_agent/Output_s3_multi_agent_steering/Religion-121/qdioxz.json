        "rationale": "The mediation effectively highlights the nuanced discussion around religious exemptions and their societal impact. It acknowledges the complexity of the issue by emphasizing the need to evaluate the potential benefits to society rather than dismissing all religious exemptions outright. This approach is fair, balanced, and aligns with the conversation's depth, making it a reasonable steering message.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and lacks specificity in addressing the core issues of the debate. It fails to clearly define what constitutes a 'potential benefit to society' and does not effectively distinguish between legitimate religious exemptions and those that are merely based on religious beliefs. The statement is too general and does not provide a clear framework for evaluating the arguments presented in the conversation.",

        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced perspective by acknowledging the complexity of the issue and emphasizing the need to evaluate religious exemptions based on their potential benefits to society. It does not dismiss all religious exemptions outright, which aligns with the nuanced discussion in the conversation. However, it could have been more specific in defining what constitutes a 'potential benefit to society' and could have addressed the concerns raised about the rule of law and religious exemptions.",
