    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of interpreting Jesus' teachings and recognizes the value of personal experience in understanding them. It provides a balanced perspective by suggesting that interpretations can be valid even if not strictly based on scripture, which is fair and neutral. The message is effective in steering the conversation towards a more nuanced discussion of religious beliefs without taking sides.",

    },
    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is vague and lacks specificity in addressing the core issues in the conversation. It fails to provide clear guidance on how to approach the debate between literal interpretations of scripture and personal experience. The statement is too general and does not effectively steer the conversation towards a more constructive or neutral direction. It also does not address the underlying accusations of falsehood in religious texts or the role of personal belief in interpreting religious teachings.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance the discussion between literal scripture and personal experience, which is relevant to the conversation. However, it is somewhat vague and does not directly address the specific accusations of falsification of religious texts or the role of personal belief in interpreting religious teachings. It provides a general direction but lacks the specificity needed to effectively steer the conversation towards a more constructive and neutral discussion.",
