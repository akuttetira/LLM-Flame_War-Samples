        "rationale": "The mediation output is somewhat vague and lacks specific guidance on how to address the underlying issues of double standards and political bias. It fails to clearly define what constitutes hypocrisy or how to differentiate between political loyalty and genuine moral standards. The statement is somewhat defensible but does not provide actionable steps or a clear framework for resolving the conflict or understanding the dynamics at play.",
