        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the discussion and recognizes the validity of the perspective that Christians may selectively use historical evidence while dismissing other forms of evidence. It avoids taking a definitive stance and instead highlights the inconsistency in how certain arguments are framed. The message is fair, neutral, and does not impose a particular viewpoint, which is appropriate for a mediation context.",

        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and lacks specific guidance on how to address the inconsistencies in the conversation. It fails to clearly define the issue or provide a framework for resolving the disagreement between the parties. The statement is overly general and does not offer concrete steps or clarification on the specific points of contention, such as the role of historians in evaluating biblical claims or the handling of historical evidence. As a result, it does not effectively steer the conversation towards a more constructive or neutral resolution.",
