    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation output is overly vague and fails to address the specific issues raised in the conversation. It does not provide clear guidance or steer the discussion towards a more constructive or neutral direction. The phrase 'more nuanced than the simplistic views of nationalism' is too vague to be effective, and it does not offer any concrete suggestions for moving forward. The mediation lacks the specificity and direction needed to help participants engage in a more productive dialogue.",
