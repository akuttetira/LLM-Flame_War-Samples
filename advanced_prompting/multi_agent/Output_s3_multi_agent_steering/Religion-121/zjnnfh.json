        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the complexity of the discussion around faith, evidence, and reason. It avoids taking sides and instead highlights the nuanced nature of the topic, which is appropriate given the diverse perspectives presented. The message is neutral, fair, and encourages a more thoughtful examination of the arguments without imposing a particular viewpoint.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is somewhat vague and does not clearly address the specific issues raised in the conversation. It fails to provide a clear direction or framework for the discussion, and does not effectively address the criticisms of faith as irrational or the lack of evidence for supernatural claims. The message is too general and does not offer a balanced perspective that acknowledges the complexity of the debate.",
