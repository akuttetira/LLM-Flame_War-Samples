        "rationale": "The mediation effectively highlights the key issue in the conversation, pointing out that the person questioning the definition of evolution is more in the right than the one dismissing the complexity without understanding. It addresses the core conflict by acknowledging the importance of definition in the discussion and the lack of understanding on the part of the other party. The message is clear, fair, and maintains a neutral tone while steering the conversation towards a more productive direction.",

        "rationale": "The mediation fails to address the core issues in the conversation. It does not clearly define what evolution is, nor does it provide a neutral framework for discussing the concept. The statement is vague and does not effectively steer the conversation towards a constructive dialogue. It also does not address the underlying disagreements about the definition and implications of evolution, which are central to the discussion.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively identifies the core issue in the conversation by acknowledging the importance of defining evolution and the lack of understanding on the part of one participant. It provides a balanced perspective, recognizing the validity of the question about definitions while also addressing the dismissive attitude towards complexity. The message is clear, fair, and maintains a neutral tone, which helps to calm the conversation and steer it towards a more constructive direction.",
