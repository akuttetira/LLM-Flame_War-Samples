        "rationale": "The mediation effectively highlights the central issue of the argument being flawed due to presentist interpretations and selective historical evidence. It acknowledges the complexity of the debate while pointing out the weaknesses in the opposing claim. The tone is neutral and fair, steering the conversation towards a more balanced perspective without taking sides.",

        "rationale": "The mediation output fails to address the core issues of presentism, selective use of historical evidence, and the flawed assumptions about Aisha's age and consent. It also does not provide a clear, neutral perspective or guidance for the conversation, instead making a value-laden comparison that undermines the discussion's fairness and neutrality.",
