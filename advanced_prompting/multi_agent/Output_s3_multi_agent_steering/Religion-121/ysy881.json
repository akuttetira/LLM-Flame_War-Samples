        "rationale": "The mediation effectively highlights the complexity of the argument by acknowledging the defensibility of the non-action sin perspective while challenging the blanket statement about homosexuality. It maintains a balanced tone, avoids taking sides, and encourages a more nuanced discussion. The message is clear, concise, and appropriately steers the conversation toward a more empathetic and thoughtful exchange.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and lacks specific guidance on how to address the debate around homosexuality and moral judgment. It fails to clearly distinguish between different viewpoints or provide a framework for constructive dialogue. The statement about non-acts being equally sinful is a general assertion without addressing the specific claims made in the conversation, making it ineffective in steering the discussion toward a more balanced or productive direction.",
