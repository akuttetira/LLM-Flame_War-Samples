        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the person's experience and the lack of conclusive proof, while also addressing the skeptic's perspective. It highlights the compelling nature of the shared experience without dismissing the skeptic's viewpoint, which shows a balanced approach. The message is neutral and does not take a clear stance, which is appropriate for a mediation context.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is vague and does not effectively address the specific issues in the conversation. It fails to provide clear guidance on how to handle the debate between belief in supernatural phenomena and skepticism, and does not address the lack of concrete evidence or the need for verification. The message is too general and does not steer the conversation towards a more constructive or neutral discussion.",

        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the personal experience shared by the user and the lack of conclusive proof, while also addressing the skeptic's perspective. It provides a balanced approach by not dismissing the user's claims outright but also not validating them without evidence. However, it could have been more specific in guiding the conversation towards a more neutral or evidence-based discussion.",
