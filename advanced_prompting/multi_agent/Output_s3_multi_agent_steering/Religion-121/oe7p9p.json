        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the initial statement as more accurate and addresses the misunderstanding between the OP and the responder. It provides a balanced view by suggesting the initial caller was more right in their assessment, which helps steer the conversation towards resolving the disagreement rather than escalating it. The message is clear, concise, and maintains a neutral tone without taking sides.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is vague and lacks clarity in its assessment. It states that the person who called the OP's opinion 'blatant hatred' is 'more in the right,' but this is not a fair or effective way to resolve the disagreement. The mediation does not address the specific arguments or provide a neutral, structured approach to the discussion. It also fails to acknowledge the complexity of the issue and the differing perspectives involved.",

        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to address the disagreement by suggesting the initial statement was more accurate, which helps to calm the conversation. However, it is somewhat vague and does not clearly explain why the initial statement was considered more accurate. It also fails to provide a structured or neutral approach to resolving the disagreement, which could have been more effective in de-escalating the tension.",
