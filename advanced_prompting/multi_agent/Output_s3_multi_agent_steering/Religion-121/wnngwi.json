        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the issue by recognizing that the person questioning the morality of child marriage and the Prophet's actions has a valid perspective. It also addresses the counterargument of cultural relativism, which is a key point in the discussion. However, the mediation could have been more neutral and balanced by not explicitly favoring one side over the other, as it does in the statement 'the person questioning... is more in the right than the one dismissing...'. This statement introduces a bias that may not be appropriate in a neutral mediation setting.",

        "rationale": "The mediation fails to provide a balanced perspective, as it does not acknowledge the complexity of cultural relativism versus modern ethical standards. It also does not address the specific arguments presented by both sides in a neutral manner, instead leaning towards one side by stating that the person questioning the morality is 'more in the right.' This shows a lack of neutrality and fails to guide the conversation effectively.",

However, the statement 'the person questioning... is more in the right than the one dismissing...' introduces a bias that undermines neutrality. While it does address a key point, the mediation is not fully balanced and could have been more neutral in its approach.",
