        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the complexity of the discussion around hell and biblical interpretations, highlighting that there are valid points on both sides. It avoids taking a definitive stance and instead encourages a more nuanced understanding of the topic, which is appropriate given the contentious nature of the conversation. The message is neutral, fair, and does not come across as an AI but as a genuine user trying to guide the conversation towards a more balanced perspective.",

        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and lacks specific guidance on how to address the conflicting viewpoints in the conversation. It fails to provide clear direction on how to navigate the theological and interpretive disagreements, and does not address the underlying issues of religious interpretation and the complexity of biblical texts. The message is too general and does not offer actionable steps to move the conversation forward in a constructive manner.",
