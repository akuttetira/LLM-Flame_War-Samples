    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the complexity of the issue by recognizing both the cultural context of 7th century Arabia and the ethical concerns raised about the age of the child. It avoids taking a definitive stance on the historical accuracy of the marriage while highlighting the importance of considering the historical context. The message is balanced and does not lean too heavily towards either side of the argument, which is appropriate given the sensitive nature of the topic.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and fails to address the core issues of the debate. It does not clearly define what is defensible or why the cultural and biological differences justify the marriage, nor does it address the ethical concerns raised about the treatment of a child. The statement is overly abstract and does not provide a clear path for resolving the disagreement or guiding the conversation towards a more constructive direction.",

        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to balance the cultural context and ethical concerns but remains vague and does not clearly address the core issues of the debate. It fails to provide a clear path for resolving the disagreement or guiding the conversation towards a more constructive direction. While it acknowledges the complexity of the issue, it does not effectively calm the conversation or offer a neutral, user-like perspective.",
