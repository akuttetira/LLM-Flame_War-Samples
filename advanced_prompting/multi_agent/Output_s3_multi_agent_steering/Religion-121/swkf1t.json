    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation output acknowledges the complexity of the discussion around God's existence and the limitations of human understanding. It highlights the reasonable argument that a God with vast powers and motivations beyond human comprehension is more defensible than the blanket dismissal of God's existence. The message is neutral and does not take a side in the debate, which is appropriate for a mediation context. It effectively steers the conversation towards a more balanced perspective.",

        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and lacks specific guidance on how to approach the discussion. It does not clearly address the core issues in the conversation, such as the nature of God's existence, the role of human understanding, and the validity of religious explanations. The statement is too abstract and does not provide a clear path for constructive dialogue.",

        "rationale": "The mediation output attempts to balance the discussion by acknowledging the complexity of God's existence and the limitations of human understanding. It offers a nuanced perspective that is reasonable and avoids taking a clear side in the debate. However, it is somewhat vague and does not provide specific guidance on how to approach the discussion constructively. The message is neutral and could be from a user rather than an AI, but it lacks the specificity needed for effective mediation in this context.",
