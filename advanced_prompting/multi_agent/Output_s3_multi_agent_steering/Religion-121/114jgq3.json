        "rationale": "The mediation effectively highlights the difference between subjective morality and the claim that God is inherently evil. It acknowledges the lack of evidence for the latter claim and emphasizes the defensibility of the former. The message is clear, concise, and maintains a neutral tone without taking sides, which is appropriate for a mediation context.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation fails to address the core issue of whether God's morality can be considered objective or not. It suggests that the claim God is evil is less defensible, but does not provide a clear, neutral, or effective alternative. The statement is vague and does not offer a balanced perspective, failing to acknowledge the complexity of the arguments on both sides. It also does not effectively steer the conversation towards a more constructive or neutral direction.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the complexity of the arguments while highlighting the lack of evidence for the claim that God is inherently evil. It provides a balanced perspective by distinguishing between subjective morality and the unproven assertion of God's evil nature. The message is clear and maintains a neutral tone, which is appropriate for a mediation context. However, it could have been more specific in addressing the core philosophical debate about objective morality.",
