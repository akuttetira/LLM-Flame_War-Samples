        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the complexity of the argument surrounding the Trinity's logical coherence and highlights the need for a more nuanced discussion. It avoids taking a definitive stance and instead encourages a more balanced exploration of the topic, which is appropriate for a mediation context. The message is clear, concise, and does not come across as artificial or overly formal.",

        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and lacks specificity in addressing the core issues of logical coherence and contradiction in the Trinity. It does not provide a clear direction for the conversation or offer a balanced perspective that acknowledges the complexity of the theological and philosophical debate. The statement is too general and does not effectively guide the discussion towards a more constructive or neutral resolution.",
