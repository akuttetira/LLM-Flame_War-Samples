        "rationale": "The mediation effectively highlights the nuance between specific instances of voter suppression and the broader argument that every vote counts. It acknowledges the validity of the concern about voter suppression but shifts the focus to the more defensible point that every vote has value. The message is clear, balanced, and does not take a sides, making it effective in steering the conversation towards a more constructive and inclusive discussion.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation output is somewhat vague and does not effectively address the core issues in the conversation. It fails to clearly define what makes the 'every vote counts' argument more defensible, and it does not adequately address the concerns raised about voter suppression, disenfranchisement, and the impact of voting on political representation. The statement is too general and does not provide a clear, actionable path for resolving the underlying tensions in the discussion.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the validity of concerns about voter suppression and disenfranchisement while emphasizing the broader argument that every vote has value. It provides a balanced perspective that addresses both sides of the conversation without taking a clear side, which helps to calm the heated discussion. The message is clear and does not come off as overly technical or dismissive of the underlying issues.",
