    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively highlights the key points of the argument, distinguishing between the claim of imposing morality through voting and the lack of concrete evidence for removing the establishment clause. It acknowledges the complexity of the debate while steering the conversation towards a more nuanced understanding of the issue. The message is clear, concise, and maintains a neutral tone without taking sides.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation output fails to address the core issues in the conversation. It suggests a comparison between two claims without providing clear, specific guidance on how to resolve the debate. The statement is vague and does not offer a neutral, balanced perspective that would help the parties involved to move towards a constructive resolution. It also does not address the logical fallacies or the lack of concrete evidence presented by either side, which are central to the debate.",

        "rationale": "The mediation provides a balanced perspective by distinguishing between two claims and acknowledging the lack of concrete evidence for one side. It offers a clear direction by highlighting the more defensible argument while maintaining neutrality. However, it could have been more specific in addressing the logical fallacies and the core issues in the conversation.",
