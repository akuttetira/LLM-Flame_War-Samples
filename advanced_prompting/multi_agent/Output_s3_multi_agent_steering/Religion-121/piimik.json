It provides a balanced perspective without taking sides, which is fair and objective. The message is clear, concise, and serves as a useful guide for more constructive dialogue.",

        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and lacks specificity. It makes a general statement about who is in the right without addressing the specific arguments or flaws in the conversation. It does not provide clear guidance on how to improve the discussion or address the issues raised. The statement is too broad and does not effectively steer the conversation towards a more constructive or neutral direction.",
