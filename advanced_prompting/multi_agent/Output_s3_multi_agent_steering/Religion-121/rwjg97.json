        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the nuanced discussion around faith, recognizing that faith can be based on evidence and that blind faith is different. It provides a balanced perspective by highlighting that those who distinguish between faith based on evidence and blind faith are more accurate in their stance. The message is fair, effective, and maintains neutrality by not taking a side but rather steering the conversation toward a more informed understanding.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation fails to address the core issue of whether faith, as defined by the participants, is inherently useless for finding truth. It merely acknowledges a distinction between faith based on evidence and blind faith without providing a clear, neutral evaluation of the arguments presented. The mediation lacks specificity in addressing the debate around definitions, evidence, and the role of faith in determining truth. It also does not effectively resolve the underlying disagreement about the definition and utility of faith.",

It effectively steers the conversation towards a more informed understanding without taking a clear side. However, it could have been more specific in addressing the core debate about the definition and utility of faith in determining truth.",
