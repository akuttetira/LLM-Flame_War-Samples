        "rationale": "The mediation effectively highlights the complexity of the issue by acknowledging that both countries have racist fans, which is a fair and balanced approach. It also points out the unfairness of generalizing all fans of one country as racist, which is a key point in the conversation. The message is concise, neutral, and steers the conversation towards a more nuanced understanding rather than reinforcing stereotypes.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation output fails to address the specific accusations and generalizations made in the conversation. It does not clearly counter the claims of racism against Argentine fans or the counterclaims against Brazilian fans. The message is vague and does not provide a clear path for the conversation to move forward in a constructive manner. It also lacks specific guidance on how to handle the inflammatory language and stereotypes present in the discussion.",

It provides a balanced perspective that encourages a more nuanced discussion rather than reinforcing stereotypes. The message is well-worded, neutral, and serves as a useful guide to steer the conversation towards a more constructive direction.",
