    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the complexity of the situation by highlighting the argument that the Dutch team was unfairly penalized and that the referee made questionable calls, which is a key point in the conversation. It also addresses the other side of the argument by noting the blanket claim about Dutch fans being the only ones unfair, which is a common refrain in the discussion. The message is balanced, fair, and steering the conversation towards a more nuanced understanding of the issue without taking sides. It also avoids using overly technical or biased language, which makes it sound like a true user rather than an AI.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is somewhat vague and does not clearly address the specific points of contention in the conversation. It attempts to balance the argument but fails to provide concrete guidance on how to move forward or resolve the disagreement. The message is too general and does not effectively steer the conversation towards a more constructive or neutral direction.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the complexity of the situation by addressing both the Dutch team's potential unfair treatment and the broader issue of fan behavior. It provides a balanced perspective without taking sides, which helps to calm the heated discussion. The message is well-crafted, avoids technical jargon, and sounds like a genuine user's attempt to mediate the conversation rather than an AI-generated response. It steers the conversation towards a more nuanced understanding of the issue.",
