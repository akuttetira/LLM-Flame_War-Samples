        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and lacks specificity in addressing the core issue. It fails to acknowledge the factual disagreement between the parties and does not provide a clear path for resolution. The statement 'more nuanced than a simple case of \u2018he did\u2019 or \u2018he didn\u2019t\u2019' is overly general and does not address the specific claims made by the users. It also does not encourage a constructive dialogue or offer a framework for understanding the differing perspectives.",
