    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively highlights the key point of contention in the conversation, focusing on the argument that Ronaldo's presence is crucial to Portugal's success and that Ten Hag's decision to bench him was a mistake. It acknowledges the counterpoint but frames the main argument as more compelling, which helps steer the conversation towards a resolution. The tone is neutral and does not sound like an AI but rather a genuine user trying to facilitate a discussion.",

        "rationale": "The mediation output is somewhat vague and lacks specific guidance on how to move the conversation forward. It presents one side of the argument as more compelling without providing a balanced perspective or clear steps to address the underlying issues. The statement is also somewhat dismissive of the counterpoint, which could be seen as biased.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively addresses the core issue of the conversation by acknowledging both perspectives but emphasizing the argument that Ronaldo's presence is crucial to Portugal's success. It provides a balanced yet clear steer towards resolving the discussion without appearing biased or overly technical. The tone is natural and could plausibly come from a user aiming to facilitate a constructive dialogue.",
