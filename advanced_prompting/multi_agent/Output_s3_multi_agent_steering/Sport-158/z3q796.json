        "rationale": "The mediation effectively highlights the key issue in the conversation by pointing out that the comments made by some users are more problematic than the lateness mentioned. It provides a clear judgment on who is in the right, which helps steer the conversation towards a more constructive direction. The message is concise and directly addresses the core of the conflict without being overly technical or biased.",

        "rationale": "The mediation is somewhat effective in acknowledging the differing perspectives but lacks clarity and neutrality. It implies that those calling out normalmisha are 'more in the right,' which can be seen as biased and does not provide a balanced view. The message is vague about the context and does not clearly guide the conversation towards a more constructive direction.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively identifies the core issue of the conversation by highlighting the problematic comments over the lateness. It provides a clear stance on who is more in the right, which helps to steer the conversation towards a more constructive direction. However, it does lean slightly towards being biased by stating 'more in the right' without fully acknowledging the context or providing a balanced perspective. Overall, it is a fair and effective mediation that addresses the main conflict.",
