It avoids taking a definitive stance and instead encourages a balanced view, which is appropriate given the context of the discussion. The message is neutral, respectful, and steers the conversation towards a more constructive and balanced discussion.",

        "rationale": "The mediation fails to address the core issue of the conversation, which is the evaluation of Messi's leadership skills during the Copa America final. It is vague and does not provide a clear direction for the discussion. The mediation also does not acknowledge the negative bias present in the conversation, such as the sarcastic and dismissive comments made by users. Instead, it presents a balanced view that does not effectively steer the conversation towards a more constructive or neutral discussion.",
