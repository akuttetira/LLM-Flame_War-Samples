        "rationale": "The mediation effectively addresses the core of the debate by acknowledging both perspectives: the argument that the comparison was a playful insult and the claim that it was racist. It provides a balanced view without taking a definitive side, which is fair and helpful in steering the conversation toward understanding different viewpoints. The language is neutral and not overly technical, making it relatable and user-like.",

        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and fails to address the core issue of racial insensitivity. It does not clearly define what constitutes a 'playful insult' versus racism, nor does it provide a balanced perspective that acknowledges the historical and cultural context of using animal metaphors to demean people of color. The output also lacks concrete guidance on how to move forward in the conversation, making it ineffective as a steering message.",
