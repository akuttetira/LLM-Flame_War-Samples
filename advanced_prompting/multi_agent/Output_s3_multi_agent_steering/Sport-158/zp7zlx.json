        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges both sides of the argument, recognizing that Martinez's actions were classless but also noting that the criticism was overly harsh. It maintains a balanced perspective without taking a clear side, which is appropriate given the context of the conversation. The message is concise, fair, and does not come across as artificial or overly scripted.",
