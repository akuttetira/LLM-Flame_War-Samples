It provides a balanced view without taking a definitive stance, which is fair and neutral.

        "rationale": "The mediation is vague and lacks specific guidance for resolving the conflict. It fails to address the core issue of whether using a photographer's bib to dry hands is disrespectful or not, and it does not provide a clear path for the conversation to move forward. The statement is overly subjective and does not offer a balanced or neutral perspective that would help facilitate a constructive discussion.",
