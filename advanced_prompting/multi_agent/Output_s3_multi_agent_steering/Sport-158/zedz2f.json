        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and lacks specific guidance on how to address the nuanced discussion around Ronaldo's personal issues and arrogance. It fails to provide clear direction on how to handle the sensitive topics raised, such as allegations and personal preferences, which could lead to further division. The message is too general and does not effectively steer the conversation towards a more constructive or neutral path.",
