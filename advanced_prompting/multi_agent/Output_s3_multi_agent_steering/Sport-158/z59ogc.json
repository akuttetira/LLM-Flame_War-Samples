        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the complexity of the argument by recognizing that the draw could be seen as a sign of the US team's growing strength, which is a more defensible perspective than the claim of inferiority. It provides a balanced view without taking sides, which is appropriate for a neutral mediator. The message is clear, concise, and steering the conversation towards a more constructive and balanced perspective.",

        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and does not effectively address the specific points of contention in the conversation. It fails to clarify the distinction between the two opposing viewpoints and does not provide a clear, neutral path forward. The statement is too general and does not steer the conversation towards a more constructive or neutral direction.",
