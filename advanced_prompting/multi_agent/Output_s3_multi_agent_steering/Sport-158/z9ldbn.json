It highlights the argument for a single, universally accepted term while also acknowledging the importance of linguistic diversity.

        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and lacks specific guidance on how to resolve the debate. It fails to address the core issue of linguistic diversity versus a single term, and does not provide a clear path forward for the conversation. The statement is overly general and does not effectively steer the discussion toward a resolution.",
