        "rationale": "The mediation output is somewhat vague and lacks specific guidance on how to address the cultural context and the emotional reactions in the conversation. It fails to clearly define what constitutes 'baby behavior' or how to navigate the cultural nuances discussed. The statement is somewhat neutral but does not provide actionable steps or clarify the complexities involved in the debate, making it less effective in steering the conversation towards a more constructive direction.",
