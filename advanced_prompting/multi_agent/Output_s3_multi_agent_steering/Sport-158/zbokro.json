It highlights the indifference of some groups and the correcting behavior of others, which aligns with the conversation's content. The message is neutral, fair, and steers the conversation towards a balanced understanding without taking sides.

        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and lacks specific guidance on how to address the underlying tensions between the groups. It fails to clearly define the issue or provide a structured approach to resolving the conflict. The statement is somewhat neutral but does not effectively steer the conversation towards a constructive resolution. It also does not address the specific points of contention, such as the historical use of terms and the cultural differences in attitudes towards the sport.",
