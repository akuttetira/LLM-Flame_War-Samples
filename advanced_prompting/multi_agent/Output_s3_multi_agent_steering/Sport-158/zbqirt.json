        "rationale": "The mediation effectively highlights the complexity of evaluating Messi's career, acknowledging both his individual achievements and team performance. It provides a balanced perspective by recognizing that dismissing Messi based solely on Champions League struggles is not fully defensible. The message is neutral, fair, and steers the conversation towards a more nuanced discussion about the 'GOAT' debate, which is appropriate for the context of the conversation.",

        "rationale": "The mediation message is somewhat vague and lacks specific guidance on how to address the debate between Messi and Mbapp\u00e9. It also fails to clearly address the underlying issue of comparing players across different eras and contexts. The message is somewhat neutral but does not provide a clear framework for resolving the debate in a constructive manner.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the complexity of the 'GOAT' debate by recognizing both Messi's individual achievements and the context of team performance. It addresses the criticism of Messi's Champions League struggles without dismissing the argument that he is the GOAT. The message is balanced, fair, and provides a nuanced perspective that encourages a more thoughtful discussion rather than a confrontational one. However, it could have been more specific in addressing the comparison with Mbapp\u00e9 and the historical context of the players' careers.",
