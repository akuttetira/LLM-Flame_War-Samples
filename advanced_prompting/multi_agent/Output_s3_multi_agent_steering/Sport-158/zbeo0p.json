        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the complexity of the situation and recognizes the defender's perspective as more valid. It avoids taking sides in a heated argument and instead focuses on the underlying issue of respect and impartiality. The message is neutral, concise, and provides a constructive direction without being overly prescriptive.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is somewhat vague and lacks specific guidance on how to move the conversation forward. It makes a general claim about who is 'more in the right' without addressing the underlying issues or providing a clear path for constructive dialogue. The statement is also somewhat dismissive of the aggressive posters without offering a balanced perspective or actionable steps for resolution.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the defender's perspective while also addressing the aggressive tone of the other side. It provides a balanced view without taking sides, which is appropriate for a mediation message. However, it could be more specific in guiding the conversation towards respect and constructive dialogue.",
