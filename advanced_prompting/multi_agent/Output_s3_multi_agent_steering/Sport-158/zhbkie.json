        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and fails to address the specific issues in the conversation. It does not provide clear guidance on how to move forward or resolve the underlying tensions. The statement about European dominance being 'more nuanced' is too abstract and does not effectively steer the conversation towards a constructive path. The mediation lacks specificity and fails to address the derogatory language and cultural resentment present in the discussion.",
