        "rationale": "The mediation output is somewhat vague and lacks specific guidance on how to address the personal attacks and insults in the conversation. While it acknowledges the difference between criticizing a team's performance and insulting fans, it does not clearly outline steps to de-escalate the conflict or encourage respectful dialogue. The message is too general and does not directly address the harmful comments made by users like 'Whyevenlive88' and 'TheIronRoman', which include personal insults and condescension. A more effective mediation would provide concrete steps for users to engage in constructive discussion.",
