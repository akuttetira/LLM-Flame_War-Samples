        "rationale": "The mediation is somewhat effective in acknowledging the validity of the Hand of God goal and the likelihood of a repeat match, but it is vague in its critique of blanket claims about team deservingness or player greatness. The message does not clearly define what constitutes a 'blanket claim' or provide specific guidance on how to approach the discussion more constructively. This vagueness may leave the participants unsure of how to proceed or what exactly is being criticized.",
