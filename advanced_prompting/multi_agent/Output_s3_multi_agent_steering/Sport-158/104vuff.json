    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempt acknowledges the complexity of the discussion and attempts to position the conversation in a more neutral light by suggesting that those defending the World Cup's legitimacy are more correct. However, it lacks a clear, constructive direction for the conversation and does not actively seek to de-escalate tensions or guide the discussion toward a more productive path. It also avoids directly addressing the specific criticisms and accusations made in the conversation, which could have made it more effective in steering the dialogue toward resolution.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation is biased and does not provide a neutral or balanced perspective. It assumes the legitimacy of the World Cup without considering the opposing viewpoint, and it fails to address the underlying concerns or provide a fair evaluation of the arguments presented. The message also uses dismissive language like 'butthurt' and 'baby,' which undermines the participants' feelings and does not promote constructive dialogue.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to address the conflict by acknowledging the legitimacy of the World Cup while also recognizing the criticisms, but it does so in a way that is somewhat biased and does not effectively de-escalate tensions. It fails to provide a neutral, balanced perspective and instead leans towards validating one side of the argument. The message also includes dismissive language that could be seen as undermining the participants' feelings, which reduces its effectiveness as a mediation tool.",
