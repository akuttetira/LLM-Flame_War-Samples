It does not provide clear guidance on how to handle the offensive and polarizing comments, nor does it offer a balanced perspective that acknowledges the complexity of cultural expressions and the potential for misinterpretation. The statement is vague and does not effectively steer the conversation towards a more constructive or neutral direction.",
