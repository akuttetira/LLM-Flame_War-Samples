        "rationale": "The mediation output is somewhat vague and lacks specific guidance on how to move the conversation forward. It makes a general claim about Modric's consistency without addressing the counterarguments or providing a structured path for discussion. The statement is also somewhat biased towards Modric, which may not be neutral. While it acknowledges Zidane's style, it doesn't effectively balance the perspectives or encourage a more constructive dialogue.",

It provides a balanced view that aligns with the conversation's content and offers a reasonable steer towards a more constructive comparison. However, it could have been more neutral in its phrasing and provided clearer guidance on how to proceed.",
