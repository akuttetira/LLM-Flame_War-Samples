        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and lacks specific guidance for the conversation. It does not address the underlying issues or provide a clear path for the discussion to move forward. The statement is also somewhat dismissive of the fans' perspectives on teams that performed poorly, which could be seen as biased. Additionally, the mediation does not offer a balanced view of the topics discussed, such as the corruption allegations against Qatar and the disappointment with underperforming teams.",
