        "rationale": "The mediation output is somewhat vague and lacks specific guidance on how to address the cultural differences in sportsmanship. It fails to clearly distinguish between playful banter and potential disrespect, which is crucial in this context. Additionally, the phrase 'blanket criticism' is too general and does not offer actionable steps or a balanced perspective that would help resolve the underlying tension between the participants.",
