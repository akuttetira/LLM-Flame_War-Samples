    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the complexity of the argument, recognizing that Messi's behavior and performance can be contextualized within his age and the team's reliance on him. It provides a balanced perspective by suggesting that the argument against Messi is more defensible than a blanket personal criticism. The message is well-structured, clear, and maintains a neutral tone without taking sides, which is appropriate for a mediation context.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation fails to address the core issues in the conversation, which include personal attacks, misunderstandings, and conflicting viewpoints about Messi's behavior and performance. It also does not provide a clear path for resolving the disagreement or fostering constructive dialogue. The statement is vague and does not effectively steer the conversation towards a more neutral or balanced discussion.",

        "rationale": "The mediation offers a balanced perspective by acknowledging the complexity of the arguments around Messi's behavior and performance, particularly in relation to his age and the team's reliance on him. It provides a nuanced view that recognizes the validity of the argument against Messi's behavior while also addressing the personal criticism. The message is well-structured and maintains a neutral tone, which is appropriate for a mediation context. However, it could have been more specific in addressing the underlying tensions and personal attacks in the conversation.",
