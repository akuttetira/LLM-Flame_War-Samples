        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the nuanced nature of the argument but fails to address the specific points made by the users. It is vague and does not provide a clear direction for the conversation, leaving the discussion without resolution or guidance. The lack of specificity makes it ineffective in steering the conversation towards a more constructive or neutral outcome.",
