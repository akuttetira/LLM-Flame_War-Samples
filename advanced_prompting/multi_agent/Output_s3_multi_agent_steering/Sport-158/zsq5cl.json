        "rationale": "The mediation effectively addresses the core of the debate by acknowledging the contextual differences between Pele's and Messi's careers. It highlights the argument that Pele's achievements should not be automatically deemed superior without considering the era and competition context, which is a key point in the discussion. The message is neutral, fair, and steers the conversation towards a more balanced evaluation of both players' accomplishments.",

        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and lacks specific guidance on how to address the core debate between Pele and Messi. It does not clearly define what constitutes a 'competitive league' or provide a framework for evaluating the historical context of their careers. The statement is overly general and does not effectively steer the conversation toward a more constructive or neutral discussion.",
