        "rationale": "The mediation effectively highlights the key issue in the conversation by distinguishing between the argument about France's performance and the personal attacks. It acknowledges the validity of the claim about France's performance while calling out the inappropriate behavior of the participants. The tone is balanced and does not come off as artificial or overly prescriptive, making it a fair and effective steering message.",

        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the argument about France's performance but fails to address the specific personal attacks and insults in the conversation. It also lacks a clear, constructive approach to de-escalate the conflict and promote respectful dialogue. The message is somewhat vague in its guidance and does not effectively steer the conversation towards a more neutral or constructive path.",

It acknowledges the validity of the argument about France's team while clearly calling out the inappropriate behavior. The tone is balanced, fair, and does not come off as forced or overly prescriptive, making it a well-crafted steering message that could naturally be from a user.",
