        "rationale": "The mediation effectively highlights the more defensible argument regarding France's contribution to the team's success, while acknowledging the complexity of the discussion around player ethnicity and national identity. It provides a balanced perspective without taking a clear side, which is appropriate given the sensitive nature of the conversation. The message is clear, neutral, and steers the conversation towards a more constructive direction.",

        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and fails to address the core issues in the conversation. It does not clearly define the terms 'African' and 'French' in the context of the players' identities, nor does it provide a neutral framework for resolving the debate. The statement is too general and does not effectively steer the conversation towards a more constructive or neutral discussion.",
