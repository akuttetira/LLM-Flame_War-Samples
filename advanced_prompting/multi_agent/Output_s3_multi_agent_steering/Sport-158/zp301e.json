    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the perspective of the person calling out the referee, which is effective in steering the conversation towards a more balanced discussion. It also addresses the dismissive comments from others, which helps to maintain a fair and neutral tone. The message is clear and concise, and it does not come off as an AI but rather as a genuine user trying to facilitate a constructive dialogue.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation output is biased and does not provide a balanced view. It favors the person calling out the referee without addressing the concerns of the other participants or the potential validity of the rule being discussed. The statement is vague and does not offer a neutral, objective analysis of the situation.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation attempts to acknowledge different viewpoints but leans too heavily towards one side, which reduces its neutrality. While it does address the dismissive comments and highlights the perspective of the person calling out the referee, it fails to provide a balanced analysis of the situation or the potential validity of the rule being discussed. The message is somewhat clear but still carries a bias that undermines its effectiveness as a neutral mediation.",
