        "rationale": "The mediation effectively highlights the more compelling argument regarding the offside rule and VAR's impact on fan experience, while acknowledging the sentiment of the German fan. It maintains a neutral tone and steers the conversation towards a more constructive discussion by emphasizing the frustration with the rule rather than making a blanket judgment about Germany's performance. The message is well-structured and aligns with the goal of facilitating a fair and effective dialogue.",
