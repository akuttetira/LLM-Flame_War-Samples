        "rationale": "The mediation effectively highlights the complexity of the discussion by acknowledging that some individuals may be motivated by social validation, which is a key point in the conversation. It also reframes the debate by emphasizing the nuance of the Ghanaian fans' actions, avoiding a simplistic judgment. The message is well-structured, fair, and maintains a neutral tone while steering the conversation toward a more balanced perspective.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and lacks specific guidance on how to address the underlying issues in the conversation. It fails to clearly define the problem, propose actionable steps, or provide a balanced perspective that would help de-escalate the discussion. The statement is too abstract and does not directly address the contentious points raised by the users, such as the motivation behind the fans' actions and the broader social validation debate. As a result, it does not effectively steer the conversation towards a more constructive or neutral direction.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the complexity of the discussion by recognizing the potential for social validation as a motivator, which is a key point in the conversation. It reframes the debate by emphasizing the nuance of the Ghanaian fans' actions without oversimplifying the issue. The message is well-structured, fair, and maintains a neutral tone while steering the conversation toward a more balanced perspective. However, it could have been more specific in addressing the underlying tensions between different viewpoints.",
