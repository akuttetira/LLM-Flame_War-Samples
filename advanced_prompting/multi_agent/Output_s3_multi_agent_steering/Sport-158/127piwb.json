        "rationale": "The mediation effectively highlights the nuance in the argument by acknowledging that past achievements don't define current character, which is a fair and balanced approach. It addresses the issue of labeling someone a 'fraud' based on a single rule change without taking sides, maintaining neutrality and fairness. The message is clear and steers the conversation toward a more thoughtful discussion.",

        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and lacks specific guidance on how to address the contentious claims made in the conversation. It fails to directly address the specific accusations of fraud and the use of past achievements as a basis for current character judgment. The message is too general and does not provide clear direction on how to move the conversation forward in a constructive manner.",
