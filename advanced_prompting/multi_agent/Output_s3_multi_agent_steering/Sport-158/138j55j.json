        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and lacks specific guidance for resolving the conflict in the conversation. It makes a general claim about who is 'more in the right' without addressing the specific points of contention or offering a path forward. The message is also biased, as it implies that those still upset are more justified than those who dismiss the trauma, which does not promote neutrality or effective resolution of the disagreement.",
