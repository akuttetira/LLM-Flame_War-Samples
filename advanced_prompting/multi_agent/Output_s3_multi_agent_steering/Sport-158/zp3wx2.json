        "rationale": "The mediation effectively addresses the core disagreement in the conversation by acknowledging the argument about referee bias while challenging the blanket claim of an obvious dive. It provides a balanced perspective that steers the conversation toward a more nuanced discussion of the referee's decision and the context of the match. The message is clear, fair, and maintains a neutral tone without taking sides.",
