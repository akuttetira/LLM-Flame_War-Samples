        "rationale": "The mediation fails to address the core issue of the conversation, which is the inappropriate and offensive language used by participants. It also does not effectively steer the conversation towards a more respectful or constructive direction. The statement is vague and does not clearly explain why the claims about Messi's retirement or personal vendetta are baseless, making it ineffective as a mediation tool.",
