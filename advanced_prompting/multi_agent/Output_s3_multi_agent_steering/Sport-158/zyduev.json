    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively highlights the issue of divisiveness and lack of respect in the discussion about Pele's legacy. It correctly identifies that insisting on Pele being the greatest without room for discussion can be seen as disrespectful and divisive. The message is neutral, acknowledges differing opinions, and encourages respect for varied perspectives, which is appropriate in a mediation context.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and lacks specific guidance on how to address the divisive nature of the debate. It fails to provide clear steps or principles for respectful disagreement and does not directly address the underlying issues of opinion variation and respect. The message is too general and does not effectively steer the conversation towards a more constructive direction.",

    "final_verdict": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively addresses the divisive nature of the debate by emphasizing the importance of respecting differing opinions and acknowledging that there is room for discussion. It provides a balanced perspective that encourages respect and avoids reinforcing a singular viewpoint. The message is well-worded, neutral, and appropriate for a mediation context.",
