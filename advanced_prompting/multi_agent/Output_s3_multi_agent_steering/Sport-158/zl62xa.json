        "rationale": "The mediation acknowledges the nuance in the argument but still uses derogatory terms like 'putos' and 'hijdps', which are offensive and not neutral. While it attempts to address the issue of blanket claims, the inclusion of such terms undermines the neutrality and effectiveness of the mediation.",
