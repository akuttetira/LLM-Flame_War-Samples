    "positive_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation effectively highlights the complexity of the argument by distinguishing between specific behaviors (celebratory actions) and broader generalizations (xenophobia and racism). It acknowledges the validity of the counterargument while steering the conversation towards a more nuanced understanding. The tone is neutral and fair, avoiding taking sides but recognizing the merit in both perspectives. This makes it a good mediation that promotes constructive dialogue.",

    "negative_judgement": {
        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and lacks specific guidance on how to address the issues in the conversation. It fails to clearly distinguish between individual actions and generalizations about an entire group, which is crucial in a mediated discussion. Additionally, it does not provide actionable steps or a framework for resolving the conflict effectively.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively addresses the core issue by distinguishing between specific behaviors (celebratory actions) and broader generalizations (xenophobia and racism). It acknowledges the complexity of the argument and encourages a more nuanced discussion without taking sides. The tone remains neutral and fair, which is appropriate for a mediation in this context. However, it could have provided more specific guidance on how to move forward in the conversation.",
