        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the complexity of the debate around possession as a metric and highlights the validity of both sides' perspectives. It avoids taking a sideshow position and encourages a more objective analysis of the game's data, which is crucial in a discussion where emotional and factual arguments are intertwined. The message is well-crafted, neutral, and steers the conversation towards a more balanced and informed discussion.",

        "rationale": "The mediation output is somewhat vague and does not effectively address the specific issues in the conversation. It fails to provide a clear, objective framework for evaluating the discussion about possession as a metric. The phrase 'more nuanced than the blanket claims of being'salty' is vague and does not directly address the points made by either side. Additionally, it does not encourage a more neutral or data-driven approach to the debate.",
