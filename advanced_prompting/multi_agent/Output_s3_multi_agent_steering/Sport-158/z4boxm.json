        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the complexity of the issue by highlighting that the argument about supporting a national team and the government is more nuanced than a simplistic view. It avoids taking a definitive stance and instead presents a balanced perspective, which is important in a discussion with strong political undertones. The message is clear, fair, and does not come off as an AI but as a thoughtful user trying to guide the conversation towards a more balanced understanding.",

        "rationale": "The mediation output is vague and fails to address the core issue of the conversation. It suggests a nuance but does not provide a clear, actionable direction for the discussion. The statement is too general and does not effectively steer the conversation towards a more constructive or neutral path. It also does not acknowledge the political nature of the debate or the potential for escalation.",
