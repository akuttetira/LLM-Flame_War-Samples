        "rationale": "The mediation is somewhat effective in acknowledging the differing perspectives but lacks clarity and specificity. It fails to address the underlying issues of cultural sensitivity, context, and the potential for misinterpretation. The statement is vague and does not provide a clear path for resolution or understanding.",

        "rationale": "The mediation effectively acknowledges the differing viewpoints in the conversation, recognizing the validity of the comment about Asian representation while addressing the flippant response. It provides a balanced perspective without being overly prescriptive, which helps to de-escalate the tension. However, it could be slightly more specific in explaining why one perspective is more justified than the other.",
