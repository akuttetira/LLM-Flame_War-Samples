        "rationale": "The mediation effectively addresses the core issue by distinguishing between the definition of an 'upset' in sports and the broader accusations of racism. It acknowledges the debate around the term 'upset' while calling out the personal attacks and racial accusations that have taken over the discussion. The message is clear, fair, and aims to steer the conversation back to the original topic without being dismissive of either side's perspective.",

However, it is somewhat vague in its guidance, not clearly outlining steps to move the conversation forward or resolve the underlying conflict.
