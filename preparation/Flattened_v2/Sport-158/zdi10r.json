You can't run away from the facts.\n\nIt must be sad to get attached to a single bad game thinking that this will erase all the trajectory and tradition of Brazil in the sport. You're probably a frustrated European."

They may be the best historical world cup team, but they also suffered the most famous best down in the history of all sports... at home, 7-1, complete breakdown, tears nearly flooding the stadium. It's beautiful.\n\nI'm not saying Brazil isn't a good team and that they don't have a great world cup history. I'm saying fuck them. Fuck their cocky dancing. Fuck their machismo culture. Fuck Neymar, the bolsonaro supporting homophobe crybaby."

Yeah, fuck Bolsonaro, fuck homophobia and fuck sexism, lots of us know that he sucks, as shown by the election results, but him sucking doesn't give you the right to patronize us and generalize an entire country lmao.\n\n\nDo you cheer against the USA because of their imperialist actions? Do you cheer against Europe because of their imperialism and colonialist past? I think you don't, do you? Cause you don't see them as an inferior people you have to teach how to become better, that's why I said you have a white savior complex, really simple\n\n\nAlso, misreading a part of our culture (celebrating goals) as disrespectful and attacking us because of that just further proves my point.\n\n\nBTW machismo is present in football all around the world (maybe with the expection of the USA, cause there football is considered a \"women's game\", but whatever) justifying your prejudice against Brazil with that excuse is really pathetic"

    "text": "Cause african nations are devoid of sexism and homophobia right? You're being inconsistent with your opinions here dude, Brazil is a historically oppressed country that has problems nowadays, like most african nations, so why do you cheer for some of them and hope that others lose to \"a more disciplined team\" (btw congrats on that other xenophobic remark, cause expressing your culture = being undisciplined right?)\n\n\nI do know what white saviour complex means and you trying to explain to us brazilians how our culture is wrong is quite literally in line with its definition"

Did you know that Richarlison was one of the biggest supporters of the vaccines in Brazil and working against misinformation about COVID and covid vaccines? He literally allowed a friend of mine that was involved in the vaccines to go on his twitter and explain the importance of vaccination. He donated money to vaccination incentives. The guy used his influence for the good. He is known to be a really lovely person, helping fans and being always happy and approachable. Why don’t you talk about THAT? Why don’t you talk about the good things Richarlison did? Brazil is not all Neymar. Just goes to show you xenophobic bias once again."
