    "text": "2014 hurt the most though. We made it all the way to the final, in Brazil no less. The hunger to win for Argentina was much greater in 2014 than in Russia.\n\nBut I did remember Mbappe’s speed in 2018 and it did scare me before this last WC final. His speed alone nearly got us in the final as well."
