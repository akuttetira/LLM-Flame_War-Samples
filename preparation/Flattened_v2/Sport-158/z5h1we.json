    "text": "Basically every time Messi plays there’s 2-3 players marking him and it’s very hard for him to get past people and they make it difficult sometimes especially these days how’s he’s a bit older he finds it hard to do things that he did when he was younger and same thing happened this game Mexico was very defensive marked him well the whole most of the game so, Messi purposely didn’t get himself involved too much and played more deep waiting for that one moment like this where they won’t expect him to be there this is what he does this man’s IQ is on another level"

    "text": "They were keeping to their positions as the play was quite deep into their goal. Messi was playing bit further from usual and there were two players ahead of him, if all of them charge to Messi the other two would’ve got an easy pass. By the time Mexican defenders saw the danger the shot was already on it’s way."

    "text": "Messi is Messi. He's a world class athlete with top tier skill and IQ; as the other comments have mentioned. But part of it is also the age and fatigue of the Mexican defenders. So much energy having to guard Messi, you make one mistake, and like Curry, it's Night Night."

    "text": "He just phrased it badly. They didn't expect Messi to try long. They were expecting a cross like the last times so they were not marking Messi as much because he was further back and not going to receive cross but they still had 2 defenders near him. But it was too late by the time they closed the distance he already shot."
