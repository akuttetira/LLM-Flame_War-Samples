If you were to remove the constant mind numbing media barrage, what makes you think it’s the worst worldcup ever?"

Confiscation of personal items for stupid/mistaken reasons (they can’t tell between an LGBTQ+ flag and some random multicoloured shit) ticketing issues in various games for the first couple days of the tournament. Oh, and no beer."

So yes, I did write the comment with intention.\n\nExtremely lack luster stadium atmosphere? People who are at those matches would disagree. I doubt you know any of them, neither have you seen social media posts from them, but you’re just the echo chamber on Reddit.\n\nTicketing machine? Please. I guess you saw some post that had a video of one among thousands of machines currently in use malfunctioning. Pretty acceptable failure rate for any machinery. Besides, do you realize that FIFA is in charge of all ticketing and Qatar has nothing to do with it? (Maybe thinking that white people are responsible for it might ease your pain slightly)\n\nLGBTQ+ flag BS. Out of the hundreds of thousands attended, personally affected maybe 3 people, but obviously significantly blown out of proportion by your media, and made into a global pain."

My own country, Slovenia, has 2 million people. 200,000 died in the last 10 years. Sure, not the same age structure, but there should still be dozens of thousands of death even without anything specifically related to Qatar.\n\nSo this is not a number that proves, or even indicates, that an extraordinarily high number of people died building world cup stadiums.\n\nI'm sure their health-and-safety sucks and that there were *some* preventable deaths. But you can't prove that based on the numbers that are bandied about."
