They played with passion and determination and they weren't arrogant cocky posers like most of the top teams.\n\nTbh a Croatia vs Morocco finale would be great and hilarious. I know it won't happen, but most top teams were horrible in this tournament and they would deserve it."

No room for mistakes in these 7 matches you can potentially play in the World Cup. Also, the game consisted of around 200 attacks, I don't know how much football you watch, but this can not be classified as a boring match in my book."

They played a great match, were tactically superior, can't deny that.\n\nBut, even though after we lose I'd rather cheer for an underdog, I think its very bad for a team to reach the finals not winning their games in regular time. So many ties, so many penalty shots, since the last cup."

Netherlands were trash talking before the game and were dirty AF, while Argentina was completely silent and humble before the game. Argentina just retaliated, and showed them on the pitch who is boss. Its simple my friend: you talk shit, you get banged. Not even 10 minutes of added time will save you."

If they were, then they deserve the loss. I’d be okay with Argentina winning it all, but I haven’t gotten to see enough matches directly yet to decide on my new favorite. I’d love to see the win go to an underdog."

    "text": "mmm unlike Basketball (where luck is limited) football has massive luck, mental and motivation factors that account for 50% of the possible outcome (the other 50% being skill aka technical and tactical superiority aka quality level). So ITS COMPLETELY IMPOSIBLE TO PREDICT A GAME BEFORE HAND. Don't let anyone bullshit you saying 'A' wins 100% against 'B'. Wrong, the best team, even if its superior by a massive margin, only has HIGHER (and the bigger the quality margin the higher) probabilities of winning the game. Its like a middle ground between chess (no luck) and a roulette (100% luck). Besides luck, mentality and motivation (if you are an underdog against a top national team you get advantage here) also plays a big role. So if you are choosing favorites based on how good they are, there is no guarantee they will make it, even if they are the best by far. Will they be the most probable to win the WC? Yes. Will that 1 team win it? most likely not. You just need to go with your home country, and if you lose, just choose whatever culture you reasonate most with."

    "text": "I always start with the US, then if they go out, I switch to Germany because my mom’s family is German (she’s the only one in her immediate family born in the US). Then if Germany goes out, things get more flexible and arbitrary after that. I’ll tend to jump to Canada or Mexico as our neighbors, but after that go by things like, which team has the hottest players, and/or who seems the nicest, or who seems like an underdog that I want to finally get a win, or has a compelling backstory. Or like you said, whose culture resonates with me most. The US, Canada, Mexico, Germany, Japan, Spain, Brazil, Australia, and now the Netherlands, are all out, so it’s gotten pretty open-ended for me at this point. I might root for Morocco as the only African nation left. Or Argentina since Messi said this’ll be his last WC. There also might still be England depending on how today’s match with France (which I haven’t seen yet) went."
