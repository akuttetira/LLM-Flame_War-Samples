I would rather do that all day long than watch it on Fox. The choices were usually BBC/ITV, FOX and TSN. No chance I'm even watching it on the last two."

    "text": "It probably wasnt anywhere near as bad as I think. In the few minutes I watched, I couldnt handle the color commentary or talk between plays by the casters. They have a habit of making it very much about themselves, using lots of more modern turns of phrase bordering on memes. Hard to explain really."

    "text": "No, it was a few minutes multiple times and was always awful almost right away. Stuff like one announcer saying to the other 'I'm feeling you'. Basically a step away from colloquialisms like 'I'm picking up what you're throwing down'. Lot of in jokes and this type of very topical and breezy conversation you'd expect two friends at a bar to be having. It was a classic Americanism of putting the self at the centre of attention, rather than the subject being covered. It was clear as day."

You couldn’t watch it cuz you were personally offended by a mundane turn of phrase???\n\nHonestly it’s the most American shit I’ve heard. Sure things keep popping up in the Middle East but we’ll j keep fighting that off b/c anything’s better than hearing someone else talk about how things are going for them.\n\nAnd this is coming from an actual American. Who listens to the bbc everyday on the radio.\n\nBut once you again you can take your precious BBC and shove it up your ass til it’s gushing red and white stripes and you’re seeing stars.\n\nEnjoy your caviar dick nose."
