They shouldn't hate of course, but not shaking hands its perfectly acceptable, at least for me. The objective is one: Perform the best in the WC, not to act like a gentleman."

When Croatia played Argentina and they lost 3-0 in 2018 none of your players shook hands with our team, not even Messi shook hands with Rakitic who was his teammate in Barca.\n\nHence, I said “… and the Argentinians are capable of it too”"

As if you had a previous connotation of argentinian's behaving without class and respect. This just shows there were no lessons learned from the previous match, and european media there has controlled the amount of information of what actually caused the hostility in that match. But fair play..."

    "text": "I had an opinion about Argentina after our match in 2018 that they were classless because after we won 3-0 they walked off the field and didn’t shake hands with our team. Rakitic and Messi played on Barca and Messi ignored him too. That wasn’t classy at all. It has nothing to do with Western media at all. Just what I saw with my own eyes.\n\nHence I said “by the looks of it Argentina can too”, meaning that I’ve changed my mind since then, and also people and circumstances can change. Today Argentina showed more class than they did in 2018 and I am simply pointing out that they are capable of it, and I notice a big difference since before. Nothing is backhanded, and I meant the compliment about the team, if not I wouldn’t have commented\n\nI don’t think I’d have to be explaining a well meaning comment that much but jesus people are so sensitive."

    "text": "To be fair the team was in the middle of a mutiny against their coach, which was exposed as truly incomoetent mid group stage, even having infighting with his own coaching assistants.\n\nThey were stressed as fuck both before and after thr game. It was not against Croatia for mauling us that game, but rather frustration against our coaching staff whom players lost all trust during the wc."

    "author": "CopyPetPet",
    "text": "This, people don't realize how Argentina was in 2018. It was the definition of chaos. Besides probably in Croatia losing 3-0 isn't a big deal since football probably isn't almost a live or die thing like its here, so it makes sense that after failing that drastically against an apparent underdog it was so devastating there was no space for acting like a gentleman. They knew media was going to rip them apart, and in those situations you don't give a fuck. Besides, this is my opinion, but 'class' is overrated. Everyone is entitled to act how the fuck they want and shake hands with who they want in that precise moment. The whole idea is to win the world cup, that's it. Being a british gentleman and adopting moral standards has never been my concern. What i do advocate for is no hatred, but no one owes greetings nor 'class' to anyone IMO."

I’m mad because I’m tired of this bullshit idea that this Argentinian team is full of evil bad mobsters who cheat. It’s annoying and over the top, and shows a lack of understanding of football.
