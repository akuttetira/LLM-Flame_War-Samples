    "text": "Ronaldo has become a bit problematic with his ego lately. He cannot accept taking the bench or teammates not passing him always the ball.\n\nHe is a great player still and is an absolute GOAT with Messi but he should accept that he is past his prime and cannot get the same treatement he got years ago.\n\n\n\nThe other reasons some might hate him are mostly petty reasons like some being just Messi fans, Virgins disliking him becuase he is a highly succesful pretty boy or fans fed up with the Ronaldo hype."
