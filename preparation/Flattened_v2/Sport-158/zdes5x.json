Most people couldn't imitate even the worst football players in the World Cup, that doesn't mean it can't still be fun to discuss who performed better or worse."

Let me explain your context for you: You implied that it's not surprising that the fans are calling the team trash because they're fans of anime. This implies anime is bad, it also implies the fans are bad for liking anime, and also suggests you're literally special ed because 'anime trash' is something I'd expect from the early 2000s.\n\nSo once again, I am truly witnessing 0 IQ in the wild."
