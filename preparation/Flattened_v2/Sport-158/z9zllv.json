A really pathetic community\n\nMorons like that don't do anything other than paint the other countries they defend as anything but petty. stuck up and having nothing to dream about other than taking a 500-hundred-awaited revenge lol\n\nAlso guys like that are the vocal anti-racists that do constant reverse-unos with their views when it comes to European civilisation."

It's a popular concept for inept governments to appeal to their low IQ populations and they eat it up without question.\n\n'We can't govern properly because of what Europeans did 100 years ago!'\n\nMeanwhile, Hiroshima gets nuked to the ground and is completely rebuilt.\n\nVietnam has a 20 year war against the most powerful nation in the world and completely recovers and becomes a prosperous nation.\n\nEurope, goes through the most destructive and devastating war known to mankind where countless cities are bombed to rubble, generations of men are wiped out of existence and nations are completely bankrupt, but still manage to rebuild, recover and move on.\n\nNotice how those that move on prosper? While those that act like losers continue to be losers!"
