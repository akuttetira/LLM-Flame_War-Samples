Any player, especially the greatest footballer of this age \\*IS\\* useless without the ball. So please, come back when you have any fucking clue or comprehension. There was no shit talking so again sit down and shut the fuck up."

    "text": "You obviously have no context of what's going on, the context behind it. Van Gaal always said that Messi is useless without the ball, that Barcelona played with 10 because Messi just walked the field. He always underestimated and talked down south American players and football and put down Riquelme from Barcelona, who's Messi's idol. So he went and made his signature gesture to him, the \"topo Gigio\" hands on ears. He also said that in penalties Argentina had no chance."

You have to focus on your own work with your own team.\n\nOf course referee had a lot to see in those incidents, and players took advantage of it because of many provocations. But here we are talking about \\***Sir Modric**\\*. If you want to discuss about ***past matches***, there are threads where you can follow your concerns."

In ARG vs CRO he prevented anything from escalted and showed whos the boss.\n\nIn NED vs ARG ref didnt react and players knew they can do whatever they want. You can say Netherland provoked but the tension is rising when you see ref is doing shit - same on other side. Argentinians acted like they acted because ref didnt punish Neds"

They are mediocre and they know it.\n\nYeah we should know better, but that won't make them better rivals. They will keep behaving like little brats and then complain when they get spanked like they deserve.\n\nI guarantee they will pull the same shit with whoever they play on the next world cup."

For example England won their wc with a \"goal\" that clearly didn't cross the line, in 2014 Neuer's knee to higuain's face was a clear penalty and changed the course of the game, in 1990' finals Andreas Brehme pk was not a penalty and Codesal didn't give argentina a clear pk.. you get the point."
