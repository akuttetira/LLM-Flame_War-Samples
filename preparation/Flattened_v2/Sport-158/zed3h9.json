I don’t understand why they have to riot and get the police involved over winning a game. Just enjoy that you won, you don’t have to cause all this destruction and uproar."

Small minority of morons in an otherwise normal populace of Moroccan descent in the Netherlands.\n\nI believe we see this in multiple countries because this particular group of guys have been 'stranded' somewhere between the society of the country they live in, and the one their parents came from. But that's a whole can of worms I won't get into further."

The city gets destroyed when that team wins. Thats all I said. Chill down. You can not pull your racism card here on me."
