    "text": "I don't agree. Imo, Brazil didn't deserve to win. They won the wc multiple times but Croatia none. Brazil was also extremely confident they would win and therefore kinda cocky (they didn't want to go on penalties when the hand touch happened and they didn't send Neymar at the penalties at the end, while Croatia sent Modric). I'm extremely happy Croatia won. This is Modric's last wc and I think it's time for Croatia to finally win a world cup."

    "text": "Croatia isn’t going to win this WC. They’re playing the same ugly, defensive, foul-full game as always, got lucky because of some of the Brazilian coach’s bad decisions. They’re definitely losing to Argentina.\n\nBrazil meanwhile, hasn’t won in 20 years  (neither was any non-european team) and was one of the only chances we had of preventing France from winning again."

    "text": "I understand your frustration. Although, I still don't get your point of view. Croatia has NEVER won a world cup. And who's to say it won't now? Argentina may just lose to Croatia again and we're back at the 2018 Croatia vs France match. And who's to say France will win this time? Maybe it just won't. But Croatia, such a small nation that NEVER gets mentioned in the football world up until the humiliating loss of Brazil, gets a ton of hate because people just won't accept the fact that we're a motivated and strong team. I'm sorry Brazil, I agree you shouldn't have lost. But I'm also Croatian so I go with my nation."

    "text": "Have you seen Neymar's post on social media? I think it was instagram. He went on and on and not even once did he mention our national football team. He made it look like God was angry at Brasil, and not that Croatian football team had anything to do with the outcome. That was so dehumanizing and demeaning.\nI think i even saw someone calling defensive play underhanded but I digress. It's a tactic. And our team used it well. I wonder what will they do against Argentina.\nI dont antagonize Brasil. I very well understand you are all raised from young age to play and follow your national team. I love that. We too favor football over other sports. We too have some people to be proud of, but much much less than you because there are a lot less if us."
