Five goals each to Japan and Korea in four matches each.\n\nThe US scored three, Mexico scored two, Costa Rica scored three, and Canada 1. That's nine goals between all CONCACAF teams that have gone home already, and only a mere TWO East-Asian teams outscored them all."

And I guess 13 assassin's. Outrage is ok. Sonatine is great but you're getting into classics. And the Kurosawa films are great if you are counting a bygone era."

That movie was insanely good.\n\nJapanese movie scene is niche compared to Anime and Anime films, but still very much active.\n\nAlso Your Name and Ghibli Movies are not even half of the good shit from animated side as well. Trigger with Promare, Madhouse with Redline, an entire bag of Satoshi Kon films, another bag of Makoto Shinkai films, Ufotable just making great animated pieces one after the other with Fate and Demon Slayer, and the list goes on."

I got into game of thrones because it reminded me of all the politicking from the historical kdramas way before the hallyu wave. The late kim ki duk's movies were also good. Squid game sucks and hollywood has ripped off some stuff from japanese film"

Any way you look at it, it's gotta be one of the biggest embarrassments in the 2022 World Cup thus far, when two teams far outstrip the scoring capablilites of a combined four. This sport is about making the ball go into the net after all, everything else is just technical jargon."
