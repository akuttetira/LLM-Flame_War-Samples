    "text": "France didn't play well till atleast 70 minutes and this I concede.Yet is it right to award a penalty for an obvious dive from di maria ?\nFrance team was already sick and tired from flu and imagine starting the game knowing that the referee is obviously biased against them.And within 20 minutes their worst fears became real.\nThis is what happened and like how it was with the Croatia-Argentina game the second goal killed the game.\nIf it was not for a miracle by Mbappe we would not have reached extra time.\nAnd even during all this it is easy to overlook the fact that Otamendi escaped without a caution for his blatant foul on the French forward.There was no attempt to play the ball and he was the last defender who got overtaken.\nIt was a fucking red card ffs.\nThis was a disgrace to football.The whole match"

Clear penalty. You're just biased. If Otamendi got a red, Rabiot should've gotten a red in first half as well. Neither got a red, which is also fine"

At the end of the day the better and more deserving team won. You might have a point about Otamendi no getting a red, but it’s not a disgrace. A disgrace to football would be 0-0 to penalties and France winning 😂 only the French would call this a disgrace, literally everyone else is calling it the best wc final in history"

Di Maria may have exaggerated a little but it was definitely a penalty in my eyes and in the eyes of the majority of viewers. Also France we’re awarded more penalties than Argentina so I’m not sure how it was rigged against them."

There goes your more penalty excuse.They got more because it was legit.\nAgain I have to digress here because even that statement is false.\nWhat about the Thuram penalty shout ?\nIf the di maria one was fine the Thuram one was too"

    "author": "UWantSumInnit",
    "text": "Well I can just apply your studying analogy to the outcome of the game. France missed 2 penalties and Argentina scored all them. France should have studied penalties more. Also I’m sensing that if it had been France that won in the manner that Argentina did today then you would have had no issues, I may be wrong but this is the vibe I’m getting. I’m an Australian and we lost to both France and Argentina 2-1 so there’s no bias on my side."

    "text": "😂 I’m very aware of the difference, not confusing anything. What it comes down to is who can maintain their composure under pressure and France cracked when it mattered most. You can chant “it’s rigged” all you want, but the fact that you didn’t address what I mentioned about bias kinda tells me all I need to know. Take the L sir."
