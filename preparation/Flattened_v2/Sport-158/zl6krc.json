    "text": "I don't get how this is an incredible goal? Getting into the box from that run was impressive. He got in the penalty box, at which point the defenders are on egg shells not to foul him.\n\nThen he passed the ball past the keeper, in what we used to call a 'dew goal' in my youth because it's just a bit too easy.\n\nI know he's incredibly talented but c'mon. Myths create legends and vice versa."

Don't be tricked because he made it look incredibly simple because it isn't lmao"

    "text": "Not sure if you're blind or just can't read but congratulations on the PhD. For the 5th time. I never said he wasn't talented. I just don't see what is impressive about a world renowned football player, attacking, and then passing back across the keeper to score a sitter.\n\nPeople are allowed to say things you don't agree with and regardless of the content, I was talking about the title."
