In this case, that Japan clearly only mustered 20% ball possession in 90+ minutes of a match. Cry harder about the numbers, chump. 😭😭😭"

That is vastly more important.\n\nI don't know if you noticed, but Spain playing around with the ball without shooting was helping the Japanese team, and they were aware of that.\n\nI think Spain should have tried shooting from long distances. They couldn't penetrate, so they wasted time."

You're clearly salty over the facts, the numbers, but Japan did play a shit first half and suddenly got into gear by the second. Where is your objectivity?\n\njapan made the correct adjustments and won 2-1? 2 is greater than 1, just like you said. japan was never going to beat spain in possesion? spanish football is all about holding possession, japans plan from the start was to try and have a solid defence and punish them on the counter and thats what happened vs germany and thats what ended up happening to spain, idk but there are so many games in football where teams with 60%+ possesion lose to counter attacking based teams. people who comment about possesion being the do or die stat of football are the most uniformed football fans that exist and it would seem to be youre one of them."

    "text": "Keep this under your hat, but I nabbed a healthy nugget of wisdom from one of the Telemundo commentators a few days ago, and it relates to ball possession.\n\nSo, reportedly, the team with the least amount of ball possession tires faster than the team with the ball consistently in play, which sounds like a winning strategy any way you slice it. So, ultimately, ball possession equates to tiring the other team out, while increasing one's own chances to score as much as possible."

    "author": "Militop",
    "text": "Ball possession also means that you're behind in the score, and you must try to keep the ball so you have a chance of catching up.\n\nFrom what I've seen, almost every team relaxes their game when they're leading"
