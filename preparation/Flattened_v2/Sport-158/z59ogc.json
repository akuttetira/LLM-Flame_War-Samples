We did draw with Scotland in our middle group stage game and ultimately lose on penalties in the final of the Euros.\n\nScotland are bigger football rivals than the US.\n\nAfter maybe Germany, Argentina and France.\n\nItaly probably up there too.\n\nUSA does appear to be quite the bogey team for us though."

A country of **soccer** fantatics should not be on par with people who’d rather watch football. Or basketball. Or baseball. Or even hockey and then probably reality TV before they consider turning on a **soccer** game."
