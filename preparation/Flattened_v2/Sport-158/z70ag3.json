From +6 to -9 in 10 minutes? Impressive.\n\n* EDIT2: You convinced me with your downvotes. You **SHOULD** trash the stadium. Better? Ò_o"

Now people are doing it to have their actions posted it changes a good deed from a good thing to a selfish thing.  I dislike people who only do good things for clout.   But who knows i may be seeing more into this post than is actually there."
