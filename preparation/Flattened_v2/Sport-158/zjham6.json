    "text": "But don't you see how this will never get us anywhere? If  everyone gets to use \"acknowledgement of hypocrisy\" as an argument every debate will just go round in circles.\n\nPerson 1:\"Qatar exploited migrant workers and that's bad, let's have a discussion to prevent this from happening again in the future\"\n\nPerson 2:\"Well what about the west's reliance on cheap products produced abroad (often in Asian countries like China) by exploited workers? Isn't that bad too and need to be addressed?\"\n\nPerson 1:\"What about China's mistreatment of migrant workers in the construction industry?\"\n\nIn this example two people have made several valid points, and brought up several valid issues that need addressing, but the conversation hasn't actually achieved anything. Just constant shifting of blame and responsibility doesn't do anyone any good.\n\nSo next time someone brings up an issue either try to justify why you believe it is not an issue, or agree that it is an issue and explain why.\n\nIf you would then like to bring up a separate issue after that debate is complete that is fine, and I think you'll find people will be far more likely to agree with you and engage in a propper debate."

It is not relevant to very recent atrocities that have taken place though.\n\nWe shouldn't talk about the deaths of thousands of migrant workers to build a few stadiums in a corrupt oil state because \"the west is bad waaaaah\"? Hush."

The west has killed thousands for their own greed and the atrocities don't end on the other side, they've killed thousands of their own soldiers for a war that was little more than profiting from opiates.\n\nRead up on recent western atrocities if you think the theyre clean of them now.\n\nIf you think qatar is evil for exploiting migrant workers, you probably won't have the stomach to understand why europe and america are so dominant\n\nLets just agree that the world isnt kind no matter where u go"
