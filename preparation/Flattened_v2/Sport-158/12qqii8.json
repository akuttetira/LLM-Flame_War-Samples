People don’t do a tiger woods celebration or a Serena Williams celebration or a Michael Phelps celebration either. Ronaldo’s celebration is not what’s going to keep him relevant and Messi’s lack of celebration is not going to stop him from staying relevant. They can both be great players who will be remembered. What is Pele’s celebration? The celebration is irrelevant"
