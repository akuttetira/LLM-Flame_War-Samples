    "text": "Exhibit A: the fact that they've tried to make the phrase \"superphobe\" a thing. Similar vein to TERFs saying that TERF is a slur. It takes a lot of gall and a complete lack of self-awareness for these shitheads to claim that being hated for hating trans people somehow makes them the victim."

    "text": "It does take a lot of gall, but I've put some effort into understanding how they could possibly believe that. So far, it seems like they've fallen victim to the alt-right playbook (youtube series of videos, i highly recommend them). To describe it in a sentence: they're in an abusive relationship with alt-right ideology, that works to isolate them from nonbelievers by feeding them dog whistles that are offensive, but only if you know the dog whistle; and by feeding them \"edgy\" humor that's actually just plain racist/homophobic/transphobic, which they then repeat and are socially ostracized for. Repeat that enough times, and suddenly their only source of information is the alt-right, and they think they're victims of the \"culture war\" and \"cancel culture\"."

    "text": "Woo! Shoutout to Innuendo Studios! Yeah I noticed the 4chan shitpost trolls disappear by about a day after r/superstraight got banned. They've already normalised at least three points amongst normal people: trans people aren't valid, trans people are rapists, and trans women want to trick men into sleeping with them. This is a social stigma that we've been fighting to change for decades, and it feels like we've been taken back in time thirty years or so.\n\nThey may dress up their rhetoric, but that's just putting lipstick on a Nazi."

    "text": "It feels like it bugs me less with every iteration. Part of it is me just getting used to it, but it’s mostly that these repeated attempts to be overtly transphobic just get kinda sad over time. Nothing they do is creative, nothing they do feels genuine, I don’t even feel like I’m any less accepted. I know these people exist, and while I don’t want to make it sound like the job is done, at this point it’s just the death rattle of another failed conservative culture war."
