    "text": "That place is a complete disaster in my opinion.\n\nAt first it seemed kinda okayish, until they implemented the rules about non-supporters having to phrase everything as a question....which just turned into a dumpster fire in my opinion. Everyone is just trying to find the least awkward way of debating while also finding a way to make it a question. It's like a round of Jeopardy gone horribly wrong.\n\nTheir reasoning for it was laughable. They framed it as \"this is a Q&A sub not a debate sub\" as if their userbase has anything interesting to say at all that we haven't heard a million times over again.\n\nThis is every post on that sub. \"Hey Trump did this crazy ass thing how does that make you feel (subtext: do you not yet realize how shitty he is?)\" followed by \"Well yeah that might have been kinda dumb but really its fine because we don't really care about anything\" and then a few people that just support whatever dumb shit he did without question.\n\nThere's nothing I'm going to learn about Trump supporters from asking Trump supporters how they feel about Trump. They aren't all that thoughtful about it and don't have anything really significant to say, especially that sub's users.\n\nIt's a complete waste of effort and I view it as a bad faith effort on their part  due to the fact that they don't allow proper discussion."
