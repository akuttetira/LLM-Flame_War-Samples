Super encouraging, really makes me want to help you and support your aims /s\n\nYou've helped ensure that I'll only ever bother reading and reporting that one hateful thread. Which I'd already done - my interpretation of the post not being a death threat was based on reading the comments in their entirety at the time.\n\nYou can say I'm being petulant here, but you need to remember that mass downvote behaviour is telling someone \"your thoughts are worthless\" and that culture of conformity is toxic.\n\nGood job 👍"

The only “aim” here is to stop bigotry.\n\nOh and conformity is not always toxic - everyone wearing masks because of a pandemic is a good thing and it’s also conforming to a new norm."

    "text": "I don’t think the people in this sub are trying to convert anyone to a “cause” or anything like that. We’re trying to draw attention to bigoted subreddits so they hopefully get taken down. We’re not here to educate people - that said, maybe we should. Maybe people should be nicer and more understanding. But there are also a lot of people here that are targeted just because of who they are, and the onus really shouldn’t be on them to be extra nice just so other people treat them like human beings.\n\nI think your post was received poorly because it came across as pretty tone deaf. As an example: I’m a white person. So I’m not going to go into a sub for black people and tell them that something isn’t racism when they say it is - and that’s how your original post came across."
