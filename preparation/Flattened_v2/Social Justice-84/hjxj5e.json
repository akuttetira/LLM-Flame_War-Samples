It highlights the bias this guy is talking about, and with the sad state of the US if black men start walking the streets then sensible gun legislation might actually end up being passed. Guns were only banned in federal buildings after the Black Panthers showed up in them armed. Sure, there's plenty of things that could go wrong and I hope to to the gods that it doesn't, but maybe the more progressive people could use America's racism to their advantage in getting guns legislated on more sensibly."

They are yours to begin with**\n\nThere's a reason you dont need state's permission to exercise freedom of speech.\n\n[You dont need a \"license\" to excercise freedoms](https://www.pemagazine-digital.com/pemagazine/july_august_2019/MobilePagedArticle.action?articleId=1501918#articleId1501918)\n\nNor do you need a class to exercise any of your other rights."

Especially since we have over 400 millions firearms and less that 0.01 percent are used in crime or self-harm. I'd say an overwhelmingly, gun owners are very responsible at owning guns. Maybe we should bring back gun clubs and classes at public schools and make the class for them mandatory as part of our Civics studies."
