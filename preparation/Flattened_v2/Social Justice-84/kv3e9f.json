    "text": "The US has a law dating back to 1878 that says the president can’t deploy federal troops on US soil (but he and governors can send the National Guard) unless he invokes the Insurrection Act.\n\nBasically he needs to declare a violent uprising or rebellion, order them to disperse, and if they don’t he can send in the Marines or the 82nd Airborne or tank units or whatever. Basically it’s invoking his right to go to war against his own people.\n\nAfaik Trump hasn’t actually done this, but spreading rumors that he has are absurdly irresponsible in this present climate."

    "text": "But the rebellion he'd be putting down is by his own followers. Of course they claim it was antifa even though antifa has absolutely no reason to protest Biden being sworn in. If a huge crowd gathers the morning of the inauguration and Trump actually uses the last of his power to use the Insurrection Act and take down the crowd, it would be the most beautiful example ever of r/leopardsatemyface.\n\nIt's like that story from The Darwin Awards where two guys snuck into a trailer to kill the owner and ended up in a knife-fight with each other in the confusion. One of them died and the other got badly injured and sent to the hospital."

Nazis burn the parliament, nazis blame the communists, Hitler gets emergency powers to fight back against the evil commies, few years later, shoots himself in the head and hundreds of his followers are hung or arrested.\n\nIf history repeats itself, one hopes it goes all the way."

Now it's difficult to tell whether or not they believe the act will be used against liberals or his own followers.\n\n\nThe sub pretends it doesn't happen, but a lot of their members would be perfectly happy with that outcome. I just took a glance, right now they are all comparing themselves to Jews in the holocaust because Parlor was taken off the app store, the victim complex is truly astounding and is being used to justify any number of atrocities."

Even though trump has placed loyalists high up in the department of defense all it takes is one general saying \"That'll be a no\" and ordering his subordinates to ignore the orders.\n\nIf any of his subordinates go ahead anyway they'll be facing some charges that the military takes very seriously, as in potentially firing squad seriously, if found guilty of mutiny or sedition. Disobeying a direct order is only a capital offense in a time of war."
