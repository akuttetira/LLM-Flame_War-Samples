    "text": "That's not banning free speech. It's simply holding social media to a higher standard to where it cannot function in the irresponsible way it does today. Like, a terrorist cell is using your product to kill people? Fuck you, shut it all down then. If you can't shut down literal terrorists on your own site, like reddit, for example, then obviously you don't actually have the technology or business model to make this work.\n\nI am sick to death of these companies being literally the wealthiest companies on the planet while whining about how they can't stop dangerous lunatics and literal foreign adversaries from outright attacking our country with their product. That tells me their models aren't up to the jib and they should not be allowed to continue. When you can't stop Russia from using you as a fucking weapon against your own county? Fuck you, then, get shut down. It's up to stupid Facebook to invent a product that isn't a Russian weapon, not up to us to let them rake in money while doing the literal minimum about it.\n\nOh wah, you don't want to hire humans to go over every post or gumshoe these communities? Then your business model isn't ready. Oh wah, you don't have the stones to ban literal terrorists? Then your business isn't ready. The AI isn't good enough to detect child porn? Then your technology isn't advanced enough to deserve this much money.\n\nOh dont even get me started on the addictive nature of social media, or the mental health damage to children allowed to use it. There should be an age limit like smoking and drinking.\n\nReforming 230 would basically say: until this technology or business model is ready, they're not allowed to sit back and soak up these big bucks. You want Facebook money? Then do the work, assholes.\n\nSocial Media is a global curse."

    "text": "Reforming 230 would make platforms responsible for content to the extent that they would need to police everything. The whole point has always been that people should be able to communicate freely, including in public, and platforms can't be expected to effectively moderate *the entire world*.\n\nI don't want white supremacists in my city center, either, but the solution isn't to make the city liable for the actions of protestors, any more than it is to ban protests. It cuts both ways.\n\nThe only way forward, if a web forum is liable for its members' posts, is to ban or strictly moderate political discussion.\n\nIt's the nuclear option applied to the paradox of tolerance."

If he wants to make that much money, maybe he can be arsed to prevent it from being used by terrorists. If not, then it should not be considered a viable business.\n\nAlso, you seem to conflate social media *companies* with *the internet*. Fuck social media companies, they are vampires that make billions on an addictive and destructive product and they seem to have convinced you that you *need their product* to have free speech.\n\nEDIT: take this perspective:\n\n\"I'm Facebook, and I'm going to make more money than God selling *your* personal data, and if my product is used to attack my own country, I shouldn't be responsible for preventing that. I'll do a token effort, but only as it pertains to my image to the public, and I'll fight to prevent actual laws that might force me to. I'll convince my own data cows (not customers, because you are the product, not the customer) that I am the Internet, and without me, the Internet dies.\"\n\nAlso, if you don't have an account, it's still totally legal to form an idea of who you are based on what other people around you say and sell that too."

Because the common thread of the reform ideas is that you either have to *rigidly* adhere to a set of reasons for moderating a comment, or get sued/prosecuted. Under those circumstances, most companies are going to say \"fuck it\" and either shut down comments completely, or turn into 4chan where nothing gets moderated unless it's blatantly illegal (while *borderline* illegal gets a pass for aforementioned reasons)."

Don't give me hope.\n\nI'd dance in the streets.\n\nI've been here for 13 years. It's a cancer.\n\nThe #1 effect of having comments on news articles is to turn the readers against each other.\n\n>or turn into 4chan where nothing gets moderated unless it's blatantly illegal (while borderline illegal gets a pass for aforementioned reasons).\n\nNo, under this model, 4chan is exactly the kind of shithole that would get shut down on day 1. The very first CP post, or call to violence would be held against the site owner, specifically.\n\nThe effect this would have would be to chill \"borderline legal\" content. If you have a message board that discusses CP fantasies and is \"borderline\" and then someone posts CP? Fuck you, it's your fault. Get shut down."

Their product wasn't ready for the world. Shut it down.\n\nLook at it like this: _this subreddit should not have to exist because Reddit should have a legal responsibility to do this itself._ An enforceable one. One where, if they don't do this, they get shut down.\n\nAnd if they can't \"afford\" it, then fuck em. This wasn't a good business idea. Facebook sure as _fuck_ can afford it.
