Sometimes guys go through these temporary things where it's a sort if temporary reaction to trauma or something. I realized quickly how hostile and toxic the environment was and hopefully your friend did too."

    "text": "The more isolated this guy becomes the worse he'll get. If he really is a friend of yours then you should try reaching out. It might be too late or a futile endeavour but I know, as someone who distanced myself because of depression, that the more I felt abandoned by friends the worse it got. You're right in saying that it's only him who can pull himself out of this but without support to grab onto he will just fall even further into that rabbit hole.\n\nI understand that it's not up to you to fix this person but he sounds like he needs help and if you are or ever were his friend you need to try. My 2 cents at least."

    "text": "I'm definitely with you there, but I wasn't that close a friend and he has other people closer that would be better. I called him on it and hopefully he sees that as a sign if he's ever looking for a way out. But he definitely came off way too far gone."
