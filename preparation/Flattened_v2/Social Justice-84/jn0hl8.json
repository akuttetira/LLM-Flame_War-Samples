A trip through the wayback machine made me realize I just wasn't as aware of the racism and political extremism in the past. Originally I thought the subreddit wasn't as bad and the racism and political extremism accellerated around 2016 and there had been a gradual increase, but no, the wayback machine disabused me of that notion."
