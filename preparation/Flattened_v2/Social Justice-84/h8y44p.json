    "text": "It's a dumbshit conspiracy theory crafted by the \"geniuses\" at /pol/. Basically, in some of Hillary Clinton's email leaks she talked about pizza parties. Cheese pizza was mentioned, because they were talking about fucking pizza parties.\n\n\n\nBut since \"cheese pizza\" has a different connotation on 4chan as a codeword for child pornography, the top minds at /pol/ immediately jumped to the conclusion that since they're pedophiles who use \"cheese pizza\" as a euphemism for child porn, everyone else has to be as well.\n\n\n\nFrom this projection sprung forth a vastly stupid conspiracy theory that the pizza place her campaign ordered from, Comet Ping Pong, was actually a front for child sex trafficking, where they keep slaves in the basement. Setting aside the stupidity that led 4chan's pedophiles to project so hard onto everyone else, *Comet Ping Pong also does not have a bassment*.\n\n\nSo the mission became simple: rescue these non-existent children from this non-existent basement.\n\n\n\n\nAt this point they spread their half-baked theory to every corner of the Internet and it metastasized on the conspiracy theory corners of Facebook and Twitter, and even on a decent chunk of reddit's right wing dumpster fires. Eventually, one idiot by the name of Edgar Maddison Welch decided to \"investigate\" by showing up to the hapless pizza restaurant with at AR-15 and a revolver on his hip, chasing everyone out, throwing around furniture, and shooting through a locked closet door.\n\n\n\nHe, of course, did not find the secret Satanic sex trafficking ring because it *didn't exist*, and surrendered to authorities. He received 4 years in prison.\n\n\n\n\nThis took the wind out of the theory's sails, though hardliners maintain to this day that Edgar was a paid actor meant to dissuade actual ~~deranged gunmen~~ truth seekers from finding the nonexistent children in the nonexistent basement.\n\n\n\nNow, reddit's dumpster fires are trying to levy similar accusations against Bardfinn, accusing them (and the entire subreddit) of being evil pedophiles who false flag their subreddits.\n\n\n\n\nThis is easily defeated with a simple application of Occam's Razor. What's more likely: subs devoted to violent or harassing content being banned for violent or harassing content, or a shadowy cabal of SJWs false flagging those subs and posting CP to get them banned for...violent or harassing content?\n\n\n\nThat's right, the ban messages make no allusion to illegal pornography. It's all violent or harassing content. From the viewpoint of any human being with the basic ability to apply any sort of deductive reasoning, these subs aren't being destroyed by outside forces; their own malice is doing them in."

WRD claimed the same thing happened to them, but they didn't get banned.  It's an absolutely nonsensical conspiracy.\n\nLike always they faked a lot of evidence and they  made up a lot of lies. Oh and then a mod of WRD actually admitted that no child exploitation material was ever posted on these subs, and that they had no actual evidence to suggest that AHS was involved.

    "text": "**Yup, That's the Video They FAKED**\n\n\nThat video is as an completely unsourced and unattributed work of fiction created by a user of a hate group who merely claims to be an \"AHS whistleblower\".   It was created in an attempt to undermine the admins and to get the r/AgainstHateSubreddits community harassed.   If you actually watch it you'll notice that it doesn't actually make any sense, that it actually debunks itself, and it's incredibly fake.\n\nThis video is just one of **many** attempts that hate groups have made to get this community harassed, it is part of a long term harassment campaign specifically targeted at one of AHS's mods and the sub at large.   The groups behind this have a long history of faking evidence and creating hoaxes to achieve that end, [and hate groups are notorious for creating hoaxes to smear people they disagree with.](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-antifa-twitter-fake/fact-check-antifa-twitter-account-that-called-for-violence-was-fake-idUSKBN23B2TY) And the hate groups making these claims also have a looooooong history of smearing other communities with false allegations and lies.\n\n\nThey made a video because videos are a more emotional medium and that means  that hate groups would be even less skeptical of the claims made.   This is just the YouTube equivalent of a creative writing exercise like you would see on r/AITA or r/TIFU but it's actually less believable then most bullshittery you see on those subs.   The problem is that members of hate groups are highly emotional people and this fact free nonsensical video was designed to appeal to those emotions, they'll literally believe anything they are told, especially if it is in the form of a video.\n\n\nThey have made a caricature of what they think an AHS user is actually like.  But all they have really done is repeat the typical copypasta about internet janitors or \"jannies\" as they call them.   They've also combined that with how they think trans people act.      But all this narrator has done is **claim** they were part of this.   But there is no substance to the claims, nor does the narrator make any attempt to substantiate **any** of their claims.\n\n\nEven if you gave the narrator 100% of the doubt and believed their lies the video doesn't even implicate /r/AgainstHateSubreddits it implicates a super secret discord channel, a channel which is so secret that it doesn't even exist!  The only evidence that this super secret discord channel has ever actually existed is [[THIS]](https://i.imgur.com/U2kiNEn.png) **faked** screenshot.   And this is the **only** evidence this \"whistle blower\" provides!    Discord screenshots are incredibly easy to fake and spoof, and to cook up this screenshot they used **publicly available** content from the mod's **public** reddit user profile.    But there is an even bigger issue.   There isn't any AHS discord channel, and even more troubling is the fact that I haven't ever seen anyone mention a discord channel in the entire time that  I've modded AHS.\n\nThe **only** other evidence is [[THIS]](https://i.imgur.com/w4dymAP.png) screenshot posted by r/WatchRedditDie.   This is not \"inside information\".   Why would an \"insider\" again rely on publicly available information?   And the person who faked this video didn't count on a WRD mod admitting that they lied in order to incite a witch hunt:\n\n>WRD Mod: [*\"The kids in these pictures are not being abused in the pictures and I think it's a misnomer to suggest that they are \"child porn\" but they are certainly unwelcome.*    ***All of the evidence that AHS members are involved in these attacks is circumstantial at best, and would also be consistent with someone attempting to frame their community. \"***](https://i.imgur.com/jj7qcpa.jpg)   //  [[ORIGINAL THREAD]](https://www.reddit.com/user/FreeSpeechWarrior/comments/e74nyh/ask_me_anything/fm8ika5/?context=10000)  //  [[ARCHIVE]](https://archive.is/Mz4Ns)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**What's Another Lie Between Frens?**\n\nBut the smoking gun as to actually created this video is that this \"AHS whistleblower\" claimed that r/FrenWorld was \"brigaded\" and  \"false flagged\".   That is not something anyone from AHS would say because it simply isn't true.  Only a hate sub user would repeat the lie that FW was false flagged, because FW users made these claims on multiple occasions, and each and every one of them were demonstrable lies.   (Part of their long history of creating lies and hoaxes.)\n\n>[One of the Top Posts of all timat r/FrenWorld was a thread accusing r/TMOR of creating a fake discord as a \"false flag\" to get them banned… Except that discord was likely created by one of their mods and the actual content it contains is far worse than what they claim we 'created'.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/bush8i/one_of_the_top_posts_of_all_time_at_rfrenworld_is/)\n\nThey also claimed that r/FrenWorld was the one being \"targeted\" and \"brigaded\" by TMOR but they were once again lying.

    "text": "Yes it is \"convenient\" how subreddits like r/coomer that were dedicated to harassing other communities claim to have that happen to them just as they were banned for harassing people.   That's because they did this to get revenge on this community (who they incorrectly blame) and undermine the admins.\n\nThe subs making those claims aren't the only subs that \"AHS's hates\" nor is AHS the only people that have a problem with toxic hate subs.   At least 95% of Reddit despises the vile abusers and harassers that use hate subs as a base.\n\nThe crazy part is that initially they claimed that it was \"CP\" because they wanted to incite a witch-hunt, by making disgusting and baseless allegations about this subreddit.   But then when they had to explain why so many users from hate subs like r/WatchRedditDie and r/ConsumeProduct were seeking out then distributing the content they quickly changed their story.   But they were literally openly sharing content ***they described*** as child exploitation material.\n\n\nIn an incredibly blasé fashion WRD would admit [[HERE]](https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchRedditDie/comments/fga1wg/stop_providing_links_to_removed_content_that_may/)  //  [[ARCHIVE]](https://archive.is/2qWcv) that their users were distributing material that they described as \"CP\"!\n\nAnd many other hate subs have openly shared images that they described as being CP, and they even more widely dispersed some extremely poorly censored versions!    These images are so poorly censored (if at all) that if it was CP like they claim it was - their incompetent attempts to \"censor\" it wouldn't change the facts it would still likely be classified as CP.   There are many hate subs still have those images posted on them!\n\n\nLet me repeat that.   Users of hate subs distributed content that they claimed was \"CP\" to own the libs.   **They literally admitted distributing content they described as \"CP\" to \"own the libs.**   Hate sub users literally used hate subs to do they exact thing that they falsely accused AHS of!\n\n**So would users of hate subs post content that they have described as being \"CP\" to \"own the libs\"?   Yes!   They would have already done so!**\n\nI'll let a WRD mod explain the situation (this was when he walked back the lies WRD was spreading after they had successfully incited this witch-hunt.):\n\n>WRD Mod: [*\"The kids in these pictures are not being abused in the pictures and I think it's a misnomer to suggest that they are \"child porn\" but they are certainly unwelcome.

WRD is therefore a prime target of trolls out to cause drama for the \"lulz\".\n\n\nHere is one example of how hate groups created screenshot, in a successful attempt to use WRD to mobilize the users of 4chan/8kun into additional targeted harassment coordinated from offsite.    You only have to read the naked hatred these WRD users display to those they disagree with (AHS) to realize that these users are willing to do anything to cause harm against others.\n\n\n**After** the damage had been done and the lies had been disseminated even  a morally bankrupt mod of WRD acknowledged that this obviously fake screenshot was fake.\n\n**[[Claim Debunked]](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/clvfgh/on_a_fake_image_and_ahs_mod_fucking_faggot_is_all/)**  //  [AHS Next Goal is to Ban 4Chan, Which Isn't Even a Subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/WatchRedditDie/comments/clsnen/ahs_next_goal_is_to_ban_4chan_which_isnt_even_a/evxztb6/)   //  [REMOVEDDIT](http://removeddit.com/r/WatchRedditDie/comments/clsnen/_/)  //  [SCREENSHOT](https://i.imgur.com/aNAUB0i.jpg)\n\n\n>> Then when /POL/ doxxes them and really makes them suffer, they'll be crying about it as if they're the victims.\n\n\n> Oh boi, can't wait for /pol/ to rain down every agony on them, these people are specialized internet hunters.\n\n>> ***...Mods think my trash can vigilantism is bad, just wait till a bunch of boomers with all the time in the world are trying to get them jailed***\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**And Yes and They've Created Hoaxes To Frame Others of Being Pedophiles Too.**\n\nOn another occasions a few months ago WRD created a completely fake screenshot in an attempt to falsely smear the mods r/TopMindsofReddit as being pedophiles, all because they disagree with them!\n\nAnd of course this turned out to be so fake that even the a WRD mod was forced once again to acknowledged that it was, but once again that was only after the damage had been done.\n\n\n**[[Claim Debunked]](https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/dq5j51/peak_topmindery_from_the_watchredditdie/)**  //  [r/TopMindsOfReddit is now openly supporting pedophilia](https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchRedditDie/comments/dptdp5/rtopmindsofreddit_is_now_openly_supporting/)  //   [REMOVEDDIT](http://removeddit.com/r/WatchRedditDie/comments/dptdp5/rtopmindsofreddit_is_now_openly_supporting/)  //  [SCREENSHOT](https://i.imgur.com/o5DhDj6.jpg)\n\n> These paedophiles have their digital fingerprints all over Reddit.

    "text": "Here you have your average WRD user.    They are so incredibly deceitful that they edit their comments to try and change what was being responded to.   Because when presented with an argument that absolutely obliterates their nonsensical conspiracy theories instead of acknowledging or addressing what was presented to them, they straight up ignore 90% of the content and instead  set up a strawman to knock down and then claim victory.\n\n\n> but all I see is a few individuals that feel attacked and want revenge,\n\nThat's entirely the point.   Thank you for admitting that users from WRD and other hate subs would post \"CP\" to get revenge.   That is exactly what I was saying.\n\n>>Let me repeat that. Users of hate subs distributed content that they claimed was \"CP\" to own the libs. They literally admitted distributing content they described as \"CP\" to \"own the libs.

Yes! They would have already done so!\n\n...\n\n>You have two pictures of false flags posted on WRD that were fact checked and removed by the mods there.\n\nI love how such blatant acts of dishonesty are just brushed off as nothing by your average WRD user.   These hoaxes resulted in AHS and TMOR being harassed for months because other WRD users were too gullible and malicious to realize they were fake even after the mods called them out.  Not that a mod needed to call out such obvious fakery.    It also resulted in these hoaxes being disseminated on other platforms that never received the retraction.\n\n>You keep acting like WRD is one giant organization, using phrases like \"WRD created a completely fake screenshot\",\n\nOh the irony.   But thank you for demonstrating that trademark hypocrisy and intellectual dishonesty.\n\n>that all conspired to publish this fake screenshot, when the reality is anyone can post there.\n\nWhat a moronic strawman that incidentally also destroys your own idiotic conspiracy theories about AHS.   Are you deliberately this dishonest?\n\n>Most of your screenshots show that hate speech is in fact removed, downvoted, or barely interacted with. One of the few positive karma posts you shared there got 1 upvote in 29 days.\n\nThank you for utterly eviscerating your own conspiracy theory and demonstrating your gross hypocrisy and dishonesty!     It is curious how in order to link a subreddit to something you need \"upvoted\" comments discussing the plotting!    So not only do you have **any** actual comments or users discussing committing vile acts being upvoted here, you don't have any comments full stop.   Because that hasn't ever occurred on AHS.\n\nWe don't need any more \"brigaders\" from WRD spreading vile lies, and defending a subreddit that actually widely distributes content that they describe as being \"CP\" (how absolutely deplorable!)\n\nGood riddance!"
