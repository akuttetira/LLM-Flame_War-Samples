You can still say your ideas and opinions, talk about \"hey are trans men really men, please help me out?\" but if you just say \"trans people die\" of course it gets removed. But there is a clear distinction.\n\nIf it was censorship in like say China, the mere mention of any of this wouldn't be allowed at all."

    "text": "I've always thought of the \"censorship can only be done by the government\" argument as pretty weak considering the power social media companies like Reddit have in our society and the great harms they can cause by promoting or erasing certain lines of thought. Does your free speech actually mean anything if you're not allowed to express it on any of the major platforms? Conversely, can racism and homophobia ever really be \"solved\" when immense platforms like Facebook continue to allow it? I'm tempted to say not really. If censorship can only be done by the government, then it has become a pretty meaningless concept since the government barely filters news and media at all anymore. Thanks to big tech companies, the government has almost no control over what content we get to see or not. This is both good and bad.\n\nSo would I call it censorship when mods remove bigoted and hateful drivel from a social media platform? Absolutely, and we need to stop pretending like this is somehow bad. Censorship should not always be a pejorative. There are certain patterns of thought which, when allowed to fester in a public forum, can gain incredible power and transform society into a hostile warzone for minorities and other vulnerable groups or individuals. At this point in history I really believe this fact to be so self-evident that any argument to the contrary is bad-faith nonsense. Therefore, we cannot allow such ideas to spread and it is the (neglected) duty of social media platforms to limit it. We censor bigots because their words are harmful and an active danger to a peaceful society. The fact that we censor bigots is something to be *proud* of. I would go so far as to call it a civic duty of moderators.\n\nOf course, we can (and should) have extensive debates on where the boundary lies between acceptable and unacceptable speech, and this boundary may change over time. But there *is* a boundary, and if you cross it, you deserve to get censored. Freedom of speech simply must be limited in some ways just like literally all of our other freedoms are limited: to prevent harm and abuse."

    "text": ">  \"censorship can only be done by the government\" argument as pretty weak\n\nThe reason this comes up is because they screech about the First Amendment - which only covers speech being suppressed by the government and nothing else.  It's a point that bears repeating so long as the shitgibbons continue to try to hide behind the 1st.  What Reddit is doing may well be censorship, but it is NOT illegal."
