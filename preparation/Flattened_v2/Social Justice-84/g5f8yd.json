I have no idea why you would intentionally cultivate a  society of people walking on egg shells around each other, terrified  that the slightest slip of the tongue could ruin you.\n\nThis is literally not true. And because of stupid people who believe this, it is remarkably easy to spot the bad actors trying to stir up trouble."

    "text": "The same way I identify a TERF pretending to be a trans woman. Listen to them speak. The implication of what I said is that the people who pretend don't fully understand what being non-binary is. They see a silly identity you can just claim yourself into when it is really an umbrella of genders. It's just easy to spot a fake. I don't know how else I can explain it without an example, but I don't have one off hand. Sorry.\n\nAlso, I think I should point out that I am not advocating that transtrending is a thing with this post. I'm specifically talking about bad actors trying to subvert non-binary people."
