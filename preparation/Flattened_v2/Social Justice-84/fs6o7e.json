That was in the middle of a comprehensive survey of Cringeanarchy and the spinoffs of MillionDollarExtreme, as well as avowed White Supremacist activity on Reddit.\n\nBottom line: They **_claim_** they're cis lesbians and feminists and allies -- but you have only their word for it. You look under the hood and they're clearly not feminists at all."
