You can hear it his his voice he didn't get angry or overreact one time just kept simply asking them to step back and let him kiss's his family goodbye and get out on his own time. That's definitely a reasonable request considering the cops take their damn time anytime it comes to serving the public so why does the public have to respond instantaneously?"

    "text": "ACTUALLY [God never said all men are equal](https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2016/november/bible-never-says-all-men-are-created-equal.html)\n\n[“All men are created equal” is part of The Declaration of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_men_are_created_equal)\n\n\nThe contradiction between the claim that \"all men are created equal\" and the existence of American slavery, including Thomas Jefferson himself owning slaves, attracted comment when the Declaration of Independence was first published. Before final approval, Congress, having made a few alterations to some of the wording, also deleted nearly a fourth of the draft, including a passage criticizing the slave trade. At that time many other members of Congress also owned slaves, which clearly factored into their decision to delete the controversial \"anti-slavery\" passage. Jefferson believed adding such a passage would dissolve the independence movement.[citation needed] Jefferson, decades before the Declaration of Independence, argued in court for the abolition of a slave.[clarification needed] The court dismissed the case outright. In writing the declaration, Jefferson believed the phrase \"all men are created equal\" to be self-evident, and would ultimately resolve slavery.[19] In 1776, abolitionist Thomas Day wrote: \"If there be an object truly ridiculous in nature, it is an American patriot, signing resolutions of independency with the one hand, and with the other brandishing a whip over his affrighted slaves.\"[19]\n\nSimilarly there is a contradiction between the phrase that \"all men are created equal\" and the idea that all people, women as well as men, had and have rights. Other thinkers, for example the French revolutionary Nicolas de Condorcet, later corrected this."

    "text": "\"God said\"? To whom? Where is the source of this information? To be more accurate: *Man said that God said*\n\n\"Created equal\" what does that actually mean, may be created in the past tense sure doesn't mean they stay that way, doesn't meant they see others that way. May be equally bad or maybe equally neutral but our choices change that.\n\nMan makes poor choices as a result of their weaknesses to negative emotions.\n\nNow this is a bit of a ramble I know lol we should indeed see eachother as equal, we're all human, we share the same earth same sun same sky same air same water. Ppl chose to ignore that leaving only our difference, differences which ppl create and project, it's man made.\n\nPoint is whilst the message is good man manipulates things to serve their own desires. Man is created equal when is serves them, fear of God is used as a form of control. In an ideal world man wouldn't need the fear of God as a reason to treat ppl humanly they should do it because that is what they are\n\n(Ok idk where that came from or where is went lol my bad)"
