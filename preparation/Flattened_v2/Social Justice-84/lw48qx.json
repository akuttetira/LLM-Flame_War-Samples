More social anti-miscegenation, less legal. More using economics instead of openly discriminatory laws.\n\nAnd likely \"dem city folk\" will be an effective dogwhistle."

Obviously white privilege/biases will meander its way (as it already has) into STEM. So if there are conflicts in the future about, say, the Augmented, I think the old issues of \"wealthy white people will generally have the technology to improve their lives much more readily and cheaply than others\" will continue to play the stage."
