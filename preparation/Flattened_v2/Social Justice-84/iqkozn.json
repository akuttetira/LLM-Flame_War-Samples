It isn't a 100% hellhole all the time so it isn't an easy target. Reddit admins also seem unwilling to ban very large and popular subs (conservative and conspiracy for instance) and PCM is giant. =/"

I’ve been subbed there for a while and until a few months ago, it was just a bunch of funny memes where everyone dunked on the other. Now it’s just a hell hole, but unless you’re paying attention, it is pretty hard to detect."

PCM definitely is one and is a [massive brigading sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/if3ebc/how_rpoliticalcompassmemes_has_become_reddits/) as well. People there miss or ignore the fascism because they're being willfully ignorant of it at this point. There's tons of \"normal\" people there that don't engage in the hate but simply let it be; which is a problem all on its own.\n\nOR it's PCM people who lurk here to downvote anything about them. That's their main past time. :p\n\n**edit**: fixed due to wrong link. And it ended up killing both comments, hah. Oh well."
