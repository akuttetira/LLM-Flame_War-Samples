There are easier ways to commit suicide, this isnt ancient times."

    "text": "I too was curious about this, so I just did a little bit of research. It seems there are plenty of drugs - mainly considered/recognized as date rape drugs - that can render someone unconscious. Many of these are very difficult to trace in toxicology tests and many more are new enough that tests haven't even been made for them yet (it's difficult to keep up). Administer one of these and then hang the person.\n\nAlternatively, there's a possibility the men could have been coerced into it at gun point and/or with threats to harm family/friends.\n\nThere's probably other possibilities I've not considered. Either way, the timing, proximity, and complete lack of any video evidence certainly seems suspicious. And have you looked into the qualifications (or lack thereof) required to be a coroner? In many states, including some counties in California, you just have to be eighteen years old and have no priors. Sometimes it's literally the sheriff. John Oliver does a very alarming segment on Coroners/Medical examiners."
