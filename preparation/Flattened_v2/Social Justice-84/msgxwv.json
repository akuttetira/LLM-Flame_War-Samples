    "text": "> You can be strongly opposed to America's military-industrial complex 'forever wars' and the horror and death they bring, and also be opposed to China's genocide and human rights abuses.\n\nBut you're not, are you?\n\nOn one hand, there's the genocide you're committing in Yemen, there's the genocide you're committing in Afghanistan, there's the genocides you're committing through sanctions in South America, there's the genocide you're committing in Iran, Palestine, Ukraine and there's the genocidal coups you're trying to commit in Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador.\n\nSo if I go look at your comment history, I assume you'll have mentioned all of those genocides you're funding, that are being committed in your name, just as often as you join the chorus of Fox News hosts calling for war with China?\n\nLet's be real here: you and the other fascists that are regurgitating this anti-China rhetoric know that you're going to be responsible for another ten million dead civilians in the coming wars you're manufacturing consent for. You *know* that. You *know* that the war you're helping build towards here is going to cost the lives of tens of millions of innocent people.\n\nAnd you also know that hundreds of millions have already died in the other genocides you're *still committing*.\n\nBut you're going to keep helping the military-industrial complex keep people's attention focused on China, because it's easy to pretend you care, it's easy to pretend you give a fuck about human rights when everyone around you is calling dissenters \"genocide deniers\".\n\nIt's pure evil, but it's okay, because you'll have this comment removed too, and you won't have to think about the blood of all the dead civilians on your hands for a few years when suddenly you'll pretend you never advocated for war with China.\n\n> It's called being a rational person, rather than a bootlicking shill for either side.\n\nYou've picked a side, and it doesn't involve driving to any of the war criminals or concentration camps you fund, that are waving your flag. It involves manufacturing consent for another war with foreigners you are too racist to listen to or believe.\n\n#Pure. Fascist. Evil."

    "text": "This is such an idiotic reply. Firstly you assume I'm American. I'm not :D Oh, and even if I was - I find it weird you conflate citizenship with the acts of the government: if I were a citizen of a country and my government went to war, or committed humans rights abuses, or started a genocide - does that mean I am personally doing or supporting those things? What a stupid take...\n\nMore importantly though, you assume that because I've not made posts about the genocides and human rights abuses committed by countries other than China, that I don't really care about genocide/human rights abuses - I just hate China.\n\nNo. I made this post because the places that I normally visit on Reddit aren't right-wing shitholes where you see stuff like genocide denial or support for wars where countless innocent people die. Politically, I visit LEFT-wing subreddits, and so I don't expect to see things like genocide denial in those spaces - and yet, I found a handful of supposedly 'leftist' subreddits doing those very things. So, yes - I was shocked, and I decided to post about it. Just because I haven't made similar posts about every other party who has committed or is committing genocides, that doesn't mean I'm blind to all aside from China.\n\nI'd also like to make clear, I don't support a military war with China, nor have I ever sided with Fox News anchors on anything. Oh, and unlike you, I don't conflate the actions of a government with its citizens - so I can be opposed to the CCP's disgusting humans rights abuses whilst not blaming all China's citizens for it and wishing a war upon them. In general, as stated in my original comment, I am vehemently opposed to the US's history of profit driven wars, and to imply that I manufacture consent for them because I dare to suggest that another country's government is doing something highly reminiscent of fascism, is yet again a stupid take.\n\nI feel sorry that you have such a perverse attraction to the CCP that you wrote such a moronic essay, forcing me to respond with one just as long. Just realise that not everyone that criticises daddy Xi or daddy Mao is some nationalist American who blindly supports their own government in any evil endeavour, and blindly hates any other government out of \"pure fascist evil\"."

Millions are dying right now for your fascism, while you call people \"genocide deniers\" for not wanting you to slaughter another ten million innocent people.\n\nYou keep repeating the exact same fascist propaganda as every Fox News host and Qanon forum. You're absolutely indistinguishable from any other fascist cheering for *another* war with the current minority you're trained to hate."

    "text": "Just because some people don't lick the boots of the CCP, it doesn't mean that they're fascists. If your main argument revolves around \"you can't criticise China, because other countries are *also* committing genocide\" then there's really no way to have a rational debate with you. I don't criticise the Chinese government for the litany of reasons that vile Fox News and Qanon believers do: the majority of which are just thinly veiled racism. I *do* criticise the Chinese government, however, for their blatant human rights abuses that they're trying to cover up. The CCP's actions certainly resemble fascism much more than I, a random internet person, do.\n\nAnd once again, NO - I do not support a war with China, nor do I support any of America's forever wars in the Middle East. How is it so hard for you to grasp that one can be against actions committed by *multiple* countries. You've planted yourself firmly in defense of China's government, and you've assumed that I've planted myself firmly in defense of America's government. NO - I do NOT support the US government & military's actions in many, many, many ways. I *also* do not support China's government & military's actions in many, many, many ways. (*Note* \\- another reminder, because you keep making the same infantile argument: this doesn't mean I hate Chinese *people.* I hate the Chinese *government*...)\n\nPlease refer to my original comment, again - \"It's called being a rational person, rather than a bootlicking shill for either side.\" Get it through your thick skull that criticism of China DOES NOT EQUAL undying support of the US. I'm not even American, you fucking moron...\n\n(For your education, this seems to be your main debate tactic: **'fallacy of relative privation'** \\- [https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Not\\_as\\_bad\\_as](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Not_as_bad_as))"

But *every single news outlet that always promote imperialist wars are all singing the same tune right now*, so why do you need to join that chorus?\n\nWhy do you need to call people terrorism supporters for saying that *even if Sadaam does have WMDs, you are a part of an evil war machine for constantly refocusing humanitarian discussion on that tiny potential issue*.\n\nNone of the news outlets that promote war are mentioning any of the genocides you fund that you never mention, so why are you so obsessed with whether Iraq has WMDs? Every news host on Fox News mentions WMDs every night, but none of them mention any of the genocides you're supporting. So do you need to boost that signal, while millions are dying of your genocides that you never even mention?\n\nHow are you any different to Fox News or any fascist calling for war when you keep trying to make humanitarians focus on WMDs while *every single imperialist news outlet is already talking about that* and no one's talking about the millions dying in Yemen?\n\nIt's impossible to have these kinds of discussions with people who are inured to fascist propaganda. It's just as impossible now as it was when people like you used this exact rhetoric to manufacture consent for war with Iraq.\n\nPlease don't lie in a few years and pretend the blood of the people who die in this next invasion isn't on your hands. You could have signal boosted a dozen of the genocides you're currently supporting, but instead you joined a chorus of known fascist warmongers."
