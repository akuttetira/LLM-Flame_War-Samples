    "text": "The point of this change isn't to reign in Linus, or move 'company direction' decision making away from him.  If it was, you'd have a point.  But this really seems like just offloading the 'running a business' tasks to someone else, while also bringing in someone who Linus knows and trusts.  In that role, Terren will be there as the angel on the business' shoulder to Linus' devil.  As Linus said in the stream, he wants someone who won't be swayed by his puppy dog eyes the way Yvonne can be.  And that's good.  I'd hazard a guess that any major disagreements will go to either Yvonne as the tie breaker or to the C-suite as a whole to get input.  Linus very much is not handing over control of the company, and crucially, it sounds like Terren came in 100% knowing and agreeing with the intended end result.\n\nAs for the COO thing, I think LMG has an issue that is somewhat unique.  The entire C-suite are very close, and have been around for a long time.  And none have larger company experience.  I don't think anyone in the company had the right social standing to be expected to control Linus.  And with how Linus is, they needed to bring someone in who Linus already knew he trusted enough to listen to them when he really needed to.  Making Terren CEO adds some muscle to that dynamic too, which I think is the intent.\n\nRemember when Linus said he was burned out and stepping back from hosting most/every video? How long did that last? The only one there who both would feel 100% comfortable (in both professional and personal sense) telling Linus a hard no and trying to talk him out of something is Yvonne.  And her conflict of interest and malleability by him (his own words) mean they really do need a 3rd party.\n\nThat's also an argument for the COO thing.  Nick and Linus are close, personally.  Their personal and professional history together, starting with such a small company, is without a doubt a concern when any issues that the COO and CEO might disagree on come up. Maybe it's never been an issue, but the right thing to do is remove that issue moving forward.  This is a big business, with many employees whose pay and lives rely on it.  COO needs to be able to work without any personal feelings limiting what they discuss with the CEO, or changing how it is said.\n\n>So if he is willing to listen to Terren? Cool. But that is no different than having an adviser that you consult with regularly\n\nThat's a big part of this, and why Terren was the only option.  Linus already has a history of Terren being his boss.  *And he wanted that work dynamic to return*.  That to me says a lot.  And it is different to an advisor, because the dynamic is codified in the org structure.  Also, other employees answer to Terren first, Linus second.  I don't know of any other companies that made this CEO/CVO split specifically by bringing in the CVO's old boss who they have an established respect for."

(I've yet to watch the WAN show.)\n\nLinus said that nobody was going to report to him anymore.  This is the one thing that I heard that he sounded so relieved by.  As LMG has grown there has got to have been so many people/business units/etc that need decisions made.  Even if a lot of those people were following the chain of command and went to their respective superior, the amount of decisions he would have to make every day from then those resulting discussions would be pretty big.\n\nNevermind how it might have worked in practice when he'd be walking around the building(s) doing whatever.  The peppering of questions all the time must have felt endless.  Now he can just say hey, Terren is the one to ask about that.  I'm just the talent today on this video, or I'm just going over here to grab a part, or whatever.  Just ask Terren!\n\nI can only assume that when he mentioned that \"All of us are going to have to unlearn some bad habits,\" he likely meant that because they grew from a small company into what they are now that a lot of times people just did not follow the chain of command.  And as a result he'd be constantly managing things while trying to do everything else he had wanted to get done.  In his mind he was the CEO after all.  Now he has a lot of freedom to say hey, I'm not that guy.  We've got a CEO we are paying to make those calls.  Go make him earn his paycheck!"

The issues of chain of command seem to be beyond just the CEO level. There's a COO and other management in place that it seems are not necessarily forming a cohesive chain of command at LMG, something that Terren will need to fix.\n\nOn the Floatplane side, Luke as COO seems to manage the day-to-day operations and seems to be the final word on general operations. I don't fully see that same cohesion on the LMG side yet. I think a lot of that is the growing pains of a company that has quickly grown from a handful of people to over 100. Because of that, I suspect that the Floatplane employees won't notice a real difference, except for Luke.\n\nOn the LMG side, they are small enough still where yes, employees may go to the CEO directly with some things but where a general structure is needed where most things shouldn't be getting to Terren except through his Nick as COO and the other C-Suite folks. So in some respects the issue will not just be that they shouldn't be going directly to Linus but also that they really shouldn't be going directly to Terren either."

Depends on lots of factors such as their comp, hirability, ability to navigate through the situation, etc. Lots of CEOs eat shit all the time for all sorts of reasons. Of course a good CEO with smart ownership though should result in a CEO being able to operate with a fair bit of autonomy so long as they’re hitting their goals."

Though they both have a lot of influence to the business, have different perspectives, and I can forsee that being difficult for Linus to navigate, at least initially.\n\nEdit: A hypothetical scenario could be the CVO and COO disagreeing about a topic.

Terren is Linus’s employee.\n\nSee my brackets about previously saying (or subordinate. Whatever).\nAdmittedly, I've not worked in Canada, so tax laws may be significantly different than many western countries. But strictly speaking. Linus probably is an employee of LMG.\nMany owner-operators take x amount of cash as a salary and then further divedends/profits separately.\nThe UK, for example, is common for owners to pay themselves the maximum tax free amount and the rest as dividends, or similar compo scheme as it's more tax efficient.\nSo if these assumptions are true....then yes. Linus is an employee.\nEdit: even if this isn't true. It's barely relevant. The facts are still the same that Linus is going to be both a subordinate and an authority to Teren at the same time.\n\n\n>As for why? Linus already said it, he doesn’t want to be involved in as much of the day to day\n\nAgain. I don't think you're understanding what I'm saying. In order to be effective.\nTeren absolutely has to be given authority to make executive decisions about topics that Linus doesn't interfere with. There is no other way about it.\nYes. As an owner. Linus and Yyvonne can supercede that authority.\n\nBUT THE POINT. I am trying to get at.\nWhat if. Linus Sebastien. The self-proclaimed control freak. Who likes things done his way.\nUnfairly exercises that authority and undermines Teren, and repeatedly overrules Terens authority? He'll quit, and quickly. Nobody wants to work like that.\n\nFucking hell. Linus even said in this weeks WAN show. I'm paraphrasing.\nHe didn't even consider any other appointments for CEO. Because he got a lot of early mentorship from Teren, he believes Teren will make the same decisions as him.  What if he's wrong about that belief and Teren doesn't make the same decisions?\nOne might presume that would make their professional lives difficult to navigate.

I’ve read everything you said and am trying to explain to you that Linus and Terren will not see the dynamic the way you think it will be.\n\nLet me put it this way. Terren does not have any ownership stake. So, no matter what, if he keeps doing things that Linus feels is against his vision and has to overrule, then Linus will fire him and replace him with someone else. It’s that straight forward. For terren to be effective, he needs to use his authority to execute the vision in a way that makes ownership happy. Linus would be smart to give Terren freedom to operate (otherwise he’s not getting the value out of a CEO) but if Terren uses that freedom poorly then he will get the axe.\n\nStop worrying about the technical definition of employee here. Terren reports to Linus in real terms."

So, no matter what, if he keeps doing things that Linus feels is against his vision and has to overrule, then Linus will fire him and replace him with someone else. It’s that straight forward.\n\nI've repeatedly stated that yes. Linus and Yyvonne do ultimately have the highest authority. We're not disagreeing here.\n\n>Stop worrying about the technical definition of employee here. Terren reports to Linus in real terms.\n\nMy comments about employment are more a rebuttal to your \"actually Terren is Linus' employee.\". Every time I've mentioned it I've also made allusions to the technical definition not actually being very relevant.\n\n\nLet's try another way to phrase it. And for the love of God. It's hypothetical.\nNick as COO doesn't want to dedicate x amount of work units to developing a merch item. For whatever reason.\nLinus as CVO wants Nick to allocate those work units to developing a March item.\nTeren as CEO tells Linus as CVO. No we are not dedicating those work units.\n\nLinus as a person has admitted to wanting everything his way and really thinks they should do the merch item.\n\nNow the question. How does Linus navigate this situation?\nIf you're wondering why I'm asking. Please go and actually read the 2nd and 5th sections of my original comment right up there at the top of the chain.\n\nIn case it needs to be stated once again. Yes. Linus does technically have the authority to overrule Teren.\nBut should he? IMO. No, he shouldn't. Linus' role as CVO isn't to manage company resources. That's the CEO and COO.\nHe could probably get away with overruling once or twice. But if he keeps doing it. He will undermine Teren and possibly make Teren want to quit, or maybe just turn Teren into another subordinate. And making it not much different than if he hired him as COO or even a glorified assistant.\n\nMy original comment isn't about technical definitions. It's about trying to understand humans and that sometimes they need to wear and consider different metaphorical hats.\nAgain Linus has said it himself. Linus (co-director) is a different person who considers different things than Linus (CEO). It's going to be the exact same thing with Linus (CVO). But making decisions between Linus (co-director) and Linus (CVO) he now needs to consider Teren as CEO in decisions. (Disagreements between Linus as co-director and CEO generally only affect him). Something I think will be difficult for Linus Sebastion the person to navigate.\n\nEdit: That last sentence is literally my only point. Nothing else. Everything else is extraneous and is only really trying to explain why I think that."

    "text": "You made a point above about Linus being an employee or petulant subordinate of Terran’s. This is what I was fundamentally disagreeing with. No one will see Linus as a subordinate or employee of Terrans in real terms. If you feel the same, then great, we agree but that’s what I was correcting in our first few comments. You then pivoted to technical definitions which is why I called out the change in positioning.\n\nThe rest of your post is simply navigating the question of how well will Linus handle his transition out of the day to day. It will be interesting to see and is a new challenge for Linus. Linus seems humble enough to know he needs to give up some control, so I’m optimistic he will find a good working model with Terren. This stuff goes better when you build a strategy together that you both believe in. It makes it easier to point to the strategy as the rationale for the decision. If Linus comes in over the top it should be because of misalignment to strategy or value violations. If he comes in over the top because he just can’t give up control, then that would be bad for business.\n\nLet’s see what happens, but as I said earlier I’m optimistic given how well he’s scaled his business — that required some humility and introspection throughout the way.\n\nIf he can’t find a good working model though, the sad truth is they’ll have to figure out a new model which likely involves dropping Terren."
