And I can guarantee that the EU will not want people poking around the internals of their phone with a tool. There will be a plethora of health and safety regs about how the user replaces the battery. And protections from the user accidentally damaging the phone while replacing the battery. Or damaging the battery itself.\n\nTo put it simply, the EU will want to make the process foolproof. Disbelieve me. Downvote me. But I’ve lived with EU legislation and regulation for over 50 years, and this is want they will want to do. The EU never introduce one rule or regulation when fifty will do.\n\nThe first poster was being naive. In fact, they were being really fucking naive."
