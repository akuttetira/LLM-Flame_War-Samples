The company obviously did take steps to address them and their handling of the Madison situation to the outside world is about as good as can be expected, they did nothing to attack or discredit her and never commented on the situation until they had to. The meeting was not a bad thing despite what people are saying. They were addressing an issue that was brought to their attention whether as rumors or not.

But then they assume my defense is trying to say Linus is perfect and never fucks up, but that was never my point, and a lot of times he did fuck up... just not as bad as people make it out to be. People sure love to grab their pitchforks at a moments notice and any critical thinking just goes out the window.\n\nMy real guess here is that Linus knew there was some bad stuff, but just not how bad it really was until recently so that's the surprise. In a business that big it is easy for him to truly not be up on every little thing that goes on down to it's exact details, especially if it's one of the other managers that cause the issues in the first place, then would sugar coat it to Linus. Buuut. even though this is my guess, it's still just speculation and is honestly what I hope we end up learning because I like Linus and would honestly like to continue liking him. But he did fuck up in how he handle the response to this, and I hope that all gets sorted and whomever is the bad actor here gets ousted. And if it is Linus, then well I guess I will unsub, but that could be the end of the channel effectively."

He is a creative person with a crazy worth ethics that he seems to try to project on others. That might clash with different personalities. Different people work differently and have different priorities. Some live for their job, some prioritise their time off more, and that is okay. As long the work that you were hired for is done it shouldn't matter. I think Linus expected everyone to adopt his work style no matter what. I mean the company is his baby and he has a vision which is understandable.\nThat leaked recording of the meeting he sounded like he knew what was going on and that he was not happy with it. That's probably why he hired a third party to help with it.\nDon't get me wrong, some of his decisions are still very questionable and show some narcissistic behaviour, but this subreddit also needs to paddle back a bit."

The die hard fans downvoted the video and left nasty comments. All of the BS over the years has cumulated into this massive backlash, and yes, it's had the effect ppl want. But as of rn, a part of me is feels like they are \"addressing\" things, bc of the backlash, and not bc they believe in it. Linus' response and the wooden robotic actions in the video, plus Linus' tweets afterwards just shows that. I'm guessing he's had his accounts locked from him to prevent him from doing more damage. I'm not wanting the channel to burn to the ground, but maybe a badly scorched wildfire is needed here, to let that first new growth of green shoots rise outa the damage and decay, and become stronger for it.

Being unable to communicate together and deal with serious issues like sexual harrassment.\n\ni dont think its fair everyone is branding this as a encouraged toxic culture thing. it just seems poorly handled and the necessary support structure wasnt there\n\nagain not undermining her experience. but context matters\n\nthat being said, her abusers can go to hell tho\n\nthe only fans thing is purposely being reported without context. All im seeing on youtube are disgusted comments asking why they have an onlyfans account\n\nNobody is explaining its a parody account\n\nonce again the toxic fucks who sent in explicit images are casuing issues for LMG again"

    "text": "What Madison described is perfectly in line with those same people being incredibly supportive of Emily.\n\nHumans are prone to cognitive dissonance. We can watch things happen and our brains can gloss over some pretty terrible stuff. We tend to gravitate towards a non-chaotic environment and even the most well meaning of us will hand wave terrible events if that keeps the equilibrium or status quo.\n\nThe situation with Emily is cognitively different. She has a lot more well earned respect (that shouldn’t matter but we are people after all) and that alone may be enough bias to shift attitudes. I doubt it but it could be. Odds are the situation with Emily has been a long time coming and people respond to gradual changes better than sudden ones, such as the need to put yourself out there to deal with sexual harassment of a coworker.\n\nThings with Emily sound like they are going well. That is a huge win we should be happy for and give credit for. However, the situation with Madison is a different beast. It’s a common situation that is commonly mishandled. I work for a Fortune 500 company and we handle things almost identically to what Madison described and have an eerily similar protocol to the one outlined in the video.\n\nNone of that is an excuse for it. It’s not just LMG that needs to handle these issues better, but they’re not uncommon even amongst larger and more experienced teams of leadership."
