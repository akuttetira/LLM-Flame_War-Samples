    "text": "I don't disagree, but LTT is the big corp here. Billet Labs may have been excited to get an opportunity and figured LTT wouldn't fuck them over so they went without a NDA. Or they may have feared LTT wouldn't work with them if they requested a NDA, or maybe they couldn't afford an attorney to work out an appropriate NDA. Lots of reasons why they may have went without a NDA. They should have got one, but I could understand that they may not have.\n\nLTT may have been coercive in this whole thing which is what we'll probably never know the truth about."

They showed a CAD file (specifically it seems to be a Fusion360 file) that shows everything you could ever want to know to build this thing. Not to mention heat transfer isn't some developing science. Its literally something we learn in sophomore physics. The only value of this block is in machining quality and materials, not design."

I take it that you have little to no experience with the legal system or are probably a delusional law student or in your honeymoon phase of being an actual lawyer. I've won a civil case in Federal Court and it was a worse experience than the issue that lead me to sue, and talked to tons of lawyers & even a few judges off the record and they all pretty much say the same thing. One judge even went so far to tell me that if if I think I will get \"justice\" in a court room that I'm an \"IDIOT\"! But maybe you are right and I'm spewing \"bullshit\", so please enlighten me and others on the correct way to sue and get \"justice\"!"

    "text": "when my parents divorced in 2020, they didn't have to split their assets 50/50 because of the marriage settlement. Unfortunately for my father, mother's lawyer found a badly formulated paragraph about the splitting of the properties in that settlement. Originally my father was the only owner of the house and the 340 m² garden which he inherited from his father. Mom's lawyer sued him and he had to sell the house and the property and split the money 50/50 with my mom. The lawyer just got paid for the hours and an additional 2000€ because he won the case and my mom wanted to do so. Mother got 600k € for that and father had to pay for the court and mom's lawyer too...\n\nMaybe you never had any experience with lawyers or it's just the difference of lawyers and courts between the EU and the USA ...\n\nIn short, YES, suing some one CAN make you rich"

And suing can also make you poor as well, so many companies had to go bankrupt because of legal fees that keep climbing with lawyers that milk clients for everything they have, it's hard to find good lawyers that will take a case on contingency & even then your not guaranteed anything!"
