    "text": "As someone who has had one for about 4 years now, yes it is durable besides the fact the one front corner is a little ruined because i do the thing that they specifically mention not to do and thats sit cross legged in the chair. Besides that minor cracking of the arm rest underside that easily repairable with a drop of super glue.\n\nThe chair completely solved my back and sciatic issues and is still comfortable enough that i fall asleep in it regularly. I also sit in it without a shirt on which they mention can ruin the material on the back but mine is still in mint condition.\n\nThe chairs have also gotten better with more features over the last 4 years and i kind of want a newer one but this chair is just still in too good of condition to warrant getting a new chair. At this rate i expect to maybe be buying a new secret lab chair in another 4 years from now\n\n\nPS Don't think its fair that you are beginning to be down voted for what seems to be an honest question from someone who doesn't know"

At my heaviest I was 370lbs and the chair had no issues supporting me, even at full incline.\n\nIt may not be the comfiest for extended gaming sessions, but I've had no issues with the chair support. Though the arm rests are starting to tear. But apparently their after market ones are much better than the base ones they send out."

It also creaks like a motherfucker and I am a normal sized person (6'0, 185lb). It's 4 years old and was $500 or so. I don't think I would buy another one. My lower back is sore after extended sessions.\n\nI couple it with a standing desk to get a break from sitting in it for too long because the [seat](https://imgur.com/a/6qBAMAJ) digs into my hamstrings and makes my legs go numb.\n\nI've sat in a couple of other gaming chairs and this one is probably the best of the ones I've tried, but that isn't necessarily saying much."
