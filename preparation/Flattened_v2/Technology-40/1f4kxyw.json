Not sure if it was issues with the transition, medical issues, or whatever (not my business, 100% her business), but I almost figured she left already as we hadn’t seen her in a long time. Wish her luck in future endeavors and hope to see her back as a “guest” on the WAN Show or something."

Tech, especially the low level development and software side is filled with queer folk, furries and many other minority groups. The gaming community on the other hand is afraid that sweet baby inc is going to make games woke and a large amount of them still haven’t grasped that the n-word is more than “just a word” and maybe you shouldn’t be dropping it casually “as a joke”."

A lot of particular types of games have insanely high LGBTQ people %, the speedrun community has a lot of top players being trans etc.\n\nIt's just that gaming is a massive sphere so there's also the flipside to that, there are specific games and communities that attract more anti-social people and are thus filled with bigots. It's not absolute, for instance MMOs tend to be worse, trade chat in WoW fe is very often filled with slurs and alt right propaganda while FFXIV is one of the most LGBTQ friendly communities you'll ever see and it's filled with furries and gay & trans people.\n\nSo it's wrong to say that gaming period is a bunch of people worried about wokeness just because Call of Duty lobbies are a cesspool."

Prob also the studio lighting and 8k cameras over saturating the neon.  Adam and his black nails took me a second to think of when the last comment mentioned it.. best case scenario, maybe tech bros are not used to color\n\n:) im not complaining tho, hf bros"

Especially if he knew. Buts that’s all up in the air. As for Emily. Being trans does not equate to being a minor attracted person… from this point I’ll be saying pedophile. So we aren’t mincing words… being trans does not equate to being a pedophile. It’s not helping that drag queens and trans people are doing what they do in some circles. It is good that those circles are getting pointed out and hopefully dealt with. But we can’t put that blame on Emily or most other trans individuals. Not sorry at all about that statement."

    "text": "When she first transitioned I think Emily had some concern about backlash towards LMG if she continued to be as active in front of the camera as she had been before and based off of that she requested to not have as much camera time until things blew over a bit.  If I'm remembering the story correctly, Linus was less concerned about any backlash but honored Emily's wishes anyway.  Unfortunately for everyone, that manifest itself as her only having background roles in a small number of videos since."

Communities with mostly neurotypical people will think the same, but they have a filter to not say stuff that is not socially acceptable.\n\nJust wind the clock back a hundred years to see how these people act if it is socially acceptable. What people think doesn't really change. There's always some who think this and other that think that. The only thing that changes are social norms that keep people disagreeing with whatever is in fashion right now silent."
