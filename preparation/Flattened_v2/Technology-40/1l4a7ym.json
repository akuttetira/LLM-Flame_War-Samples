It just continually dillutes to continue limping along because even if the switch 2 does biblical numbers its not enough to long term change a trend that the industry has been going in for 20 years.\n\nConsole makers love digital sales. The margin is better and they dont have to cut retailers in. They will never want to go back. Never ever. Every kid who buys their first ps5 gets the digital one, and will never buy games in gamestops eco system. Nintendo will probably never phase out physical media BUT is not big eno8gh to keep gamestop solvent when every other retailer is competing."

NVidia's ~35 odd P/E suggests that people expect their earnings to double in the next few years.\n\nSo for Tesla to 'only' be at 100 suggests a 5 times increase in earnings in the medium term, despite the last year seeing a decrease of ~20%.\n\nIMO Tesla's car market share is likely going to be fairly stable from now as they've lost any first mover advantage. So any increase in growth has to come from new technologies, which currently seem like vapourware.\n\nOn fundamentals alone, I'd but Tesla at a buy after it has lost around 91% of its current value."
