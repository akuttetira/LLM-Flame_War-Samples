He was doing an HW News segment a while back and he was asking people to comment their favorite meme from the show of the week, and I just felt like he was headed down a path that just wasn’t him. Since the LTT drama, they started popping back up in my recommended, and I’m happy to say he’s went back to his bread and butter and mostly left that path he was flirting with.\n\nThat being said, I don’t think GN and LTT are meant to scratch the same itch. I’ve been trying to explain this to my fiancée the past few days. GN is UFC, LTT is WWE. GN is the hardcore, lets see how many watts we can pump in to this PSU before it explodes, raw facts and stats channel, where LTT is more of an entertainment channel backed by some facts, albeit, sometimes incorrect. GN is tech, LTT is tech entertainment. They can both exist in the same space.\n\nOne thing that LTT has always said that still holds true is that a truly informed buyer won’t just trust one source. We need both of them, in addition to Jay, Quinn, Marques, and JRE, to exist so that we can continue to be informed buyers."
