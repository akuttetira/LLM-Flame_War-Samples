Saying something like \"stop being bitchy\" or \"calm your tits\", you get one chance to apologize and take some training on sexism in the work place, but after that next strike you are out."

Sure, under normal circumstances, a person would not harm themselves so that they could take a day off. But she said it was not normal circumstances. She was in a toxic work environment. So she did was a normal person would do, she asked to take time off for her mental health. But that's happened? She was either denied time off or was belittled and shamed for wanting to take time off. She is now someone whose mental health has been pushed to the limit and any normal options to deal with it have been taken away. So, she acted out of desperation. She felt the only way she could take a break away from the toxic work environment was to physically harm herself because the physical harm would be less serious than the mental and emotional abuse she had to put up with at work."

Or do you mean when `her work` told her to \"calm her tits\" or \"stop being bitchy?\"\n\nWhat an incredibly passive way to phrase the repeated bad actions on the part of LTT management, while you attempt use the ill mental health induced in her by this experience as a reason to call her credibility entirely into question.\n\n>The woman reporting abuse just wants 'attention'\n\n>The woman reporting abuse is just kookoo crazy!\n\nThe whooooole bingo card is out on this sub today. And it is just so obvious how few of you have *ever* held a full time job, much less ever been mistreated at one. There will be an independent investigation, and it will be obvious who was being reasonable about waiting for the full truth and who was *playing* reasonable to demean the testimony of someone suffering."

LMG hiring a third party auditor seems like a good resolution here, what else do people want? It feels like people just want to be angry."

It's pretty bad to be verbally abused at work and all that.\n\nHowever, anyone can injure themselves that gravely and put the blame on someone else - in this case LTT. I'm also sure she was grieving at the time, could also be because of that. So I'm taking that part as \"big if true\" because it's easy to say and pack on the blame.\n\nIf it's all true LTT should get what's coming because of it. She *should* super 1000000000000000000000000000% go to the Canadian authorities if it was the only way she could get off work."

She also said it was her dream job, THE dream job. It would be VERY difficult to walk away from the one thing you wanted most in life, even if it turned out to be a nightmare. That's incredibly embarrassing, and a lot of people will put up with a lot of evil to save themselves from (what they think) makes them look weak or naive. She left the country for this job for god's sake...she probably had family or friends that told her it may not have been the wisest move, but she stood by it because it was her dream job and one of her heroes. It hurts like hell to realize you were wrong and your loved ones were right. It can be extremely difficult to admit that to yourself and anyone around you."
