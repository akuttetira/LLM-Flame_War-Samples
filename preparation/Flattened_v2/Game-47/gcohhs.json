People are delusional conspiracy theorists and will just go to their grave insisting that Sony and ND are lying when there's legit fucking no evidence to back up the idea that it was an employee.\n\nHumanity really needs to be culled.

So I get that people ran with what they could find.\n\nAlso anecdotal , but most of the places I have watched from have stated that it was a rumor that it was an employee.\n\nNo reason to get upset/mad on people covering current gaming events if they update stories with more current info. That’d be like getting mad at the actual news every time they do an update on a developing story."

He pretty much confirmed the exact same thing.\n\nThis could very well be  PR damage control but I don't think it is. Reason being that this is not what ND themselves posted, but a third party and the fact that this won't do much. Whatever happened, happened. This info won't mean much in the grand scheme of things. People who believe ND is at fault will continue to believe so. People who think it wasn't ND/Sony got one more reason to continue beleiving so.\n\nIf this was something Druckmann himself posted, I'd be right there with you. Like a company or not, I'd like some third party perspective more than anything. But we only have unsubstantiated reddit/4chan rumors on one hand and several 3rd parties saying the opposite. For now, I go with the latter, until new info comes up.\n\nI'm more interested in seeing what info these 3rd parties can come up with, rather than what ND themselves have to say."

It really pisses me off how much the gaming world just jumps on the bandwagon and doesn't think for themselves. Now it's all CdPR gOoD! Nd BaD! It wouldn't surprise me if the leaker used things like deepfake or had really good editing skills to make the game look like shit as much as possible.

Like, I have to pee every ten minutes.\n\nThe biggest issue for me though was the shooting and moving. I was in the army and now I have to shoot for my work. I’m a really good shot.

Let's say The next episode then takes place from the Nazi's perspective of them getting revenge on/hunting Walt and his family because you find out Walt had killed their people in a prior incident that arguably was the right call. Imagine having to watch your favorite characters now be portrayed as the bad guys and killed brutally while the show tries sympathizing with the nazis because they had been wronged prior.\n\nThere's also other \"issues\" people have with certain characters that I'm not gonna touch but needless to say certain choices made by the developers were not met with the praise or acceptance they were potentially assuming would occur."

To me it's because of how deeply emotionally involved I feel with the characters, their story and development throughout the game.\n\nThis is not just another FPS, it's  one of the very few games, where I actually care about what happens to the characters, and because of that, it means a lot not knowing what happens. If I know the future of the characters, the story up till that point will suddenly feel hollow.\n\nPlease do yourself a favor and keep yourself spoiler free... and now, go get TLOU 1 and start playing."
