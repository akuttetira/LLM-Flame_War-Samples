They always fall. 90% of the time they fail to qualify as a result.\n\nThere's something about the low stakes and cuteness of the game which makes grabbing so much fun.\n\nBesides, if you look like you know what you're doing, why wouldn't I eliminate you? One less competent person to contend with on the final round.\n\nAlso frankly it's a silly game for silly people and if you don't find it funny when you get dicked over in the same way, you need to grow up ;) there's literally nothing at stake."

Every player they eliminate brings themselves one step closer to victory.\n\nIt is a battle royale after all and there is risk to actively eliminating other players as dear tomatoboy found out."

Other maps where 40 will qualify no matter what you’re just being a dick haha"
