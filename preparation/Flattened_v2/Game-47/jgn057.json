    "text": "Here are a few notes that may give you an idea that i got from this review of accessibility in the game: https://caniplaythat.com/2020/06/12/our-the-last-of-us-2-discussion-on-accessibility-and-blind-impressions/\n\n“There are audio cues that tells you which button to push, also even the object you are interacting with. It gives you a sound effect of what that object is that you’re about to interact with.\n\nGame: [Square button, scan for enemies. Circle button, scan for items.]\n\nThere is text to speech in every single piece of text that is on the screen. It has text to speech and it will read it out to you. There’s even an audio slider of volume that you can adjust just for that feature alone. If you want that to be a little bit louder than everything else, you can totally do that.\n\nA high contrast mode where it highlights your character and your allies as blue and the enemies as red and items as yellow. It kind of gives an outline and a bit of a glow to all the environments in it. So you can actually be able to see and distinguish what is what in the world that you’re in so that you’re not having to try to distinguish, okay, where are certain things in the world, and how far is that enemy away from me?\n\nThe HUD scaling. Not only does it increase the little like the bottom right corner where it shows you what weapon you’re using and stuff like that, but it increases the HUD of the crossbar when you’re having to switch weapons, it increases the size of the buttons and the text prompts and even just the text themselves whenever you’re reading notes, it also increases the font size in that, but it also reads out text to speech, the entire thing. There are some custom words in there that I didn’t think the text to speech would pick up, and yet it did. Oh, it swears. This text to speech swears like a mother.”\n\n\nThere are other things to help as well! Those are just a few examples I chose. Also to note, blind people don’t just see complete black/nothingness (well, in not all cases i should say) - they can perceive light and colour to varying degrees so things like the contrast option help in those regards - this game can be played with your eyes closed though. hopefully this helped you understand!"

    "text": "Accessibility features also essentially turn on godmode, and turn the game into an auto-run game.\n\nNot saying people with severe disabilities shouldn't be allowed to play games, but several of the features really turn the game into an awkward movie, and removes almost every aspect of player input to the game, let alone challenges. At that point why not just watch someone stream the game instead of pressing a button once every 5 minutes to confirm you are still a living human."
