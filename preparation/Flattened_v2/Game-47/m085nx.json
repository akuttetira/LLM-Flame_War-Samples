    "text": "This is a great response and does an excellent job at focusing in on the issue. The fastest way to downplay BLM is by saying, “what about everyone else? Do they not matter?”\n\nThe fastest way to downplay the importance of Women’s Day is by saying “What about men’s day?”\n\nAs a middle class, healthy, white male, I’m really fucking tired of people thinking that I need some special day to help *my people* stand out from the crowd. I am the fucking crowd. People like me have systematically fucked over groups for *NOT* being like me. Let’s undo that. These days serve to recognize that.\n\nBut for real, thanks for putting it into such a bite sized approach."

Can we finally pay men and women the same salaries for the same jobs? Can we stop objectifying women on a daily basis? Can we treat women with the same respect as we treat men? Okay, I’ma get off r/PS4 now, not the platform..."
