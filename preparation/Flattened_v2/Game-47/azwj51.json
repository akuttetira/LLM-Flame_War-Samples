    "text": "> Appreciate the insight. I think a lot of people don't realize it's a social issue over there with the mentality of \"Win by absolutely any means necessary.\"\n\nIt's one of the things that some westerners might not be familiar with especially when talking about Asian gamers because there is, obviously, a cultural divide.\n\nWhat the OP presented is also common here in the Philippines. It's not just the \"win by absolutely any means\" mentality, it's also the social aspect of peer pressure and people wanting to emulate those who have success.\n\nOne of the reasons why microtransactions became popular during the early-2000s in our online PC games was because these were seen as \"status symbols.\"\n\nIt's been ingrained in our society -- from the basic building blocks of a family to larger communities -- that you'd want to achieve success, and you'd look up to people who've obtained the experience and the means to achieve that success.\n\n- \"Tingnan mo yung pinsan mo, mayaman.\" -- Look at your cousin, he's rich.\n\n- \"Yung kapitbahay natin ang daming pera.\" -- Our neighbor has a lot of money.\n\n- \"Yung kaklase mo, ang galing galing sa Math at English.\" -- Your classmate is good in Math and English classes.\n\nFrom a young age, you realize that you need to reach that level and to even surpass those whom you are being compared to. It's a common trait in Asian culture, I believe. Heck, you'd even see Asian stand-up comedians joking about their childhoods or what their parents were like."

It really depends on the context. There are many things that are worth praising simply for having done them, regardless of whether you did them \"best.\" Those things, imo, should be rewarded with children to reinforce the idea that simply working hard at something is important.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the context of competitive activities they are usually given in addition to placement trophies, and in that context, are more like souvenirs from that particular event. I received plenty of both in my childhood so I have a hard time registering what's damaging about any of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNeither getting participation trophies nor being excluded from prizes when I didn't compete well had a negative impact on me.

Think of our Sherlocks, Houses, Monks, or any number of TV geniuses who have photographic memories. They are not hard workers they are natural geniuses. People didn't work hard they are just smart. The athlete isn't well trained they are talented. This idea of innate greatness pervades our fiction and culture in pretty much every level. Such is the reason for the participation trophy. When talent is believed to be innate no trophy indicates an innate deficit to the participant that is impossible to overcome. Sure you get your underdog stories but even then you here things like \"There is greatness in you\" or \"You can't teach real talent\" because hard work is to find something that is already great about you not to build greatness.\n\nThen in the east the idea is reversed but also in the extreme. Anybody can be successful so if you are not you are lazy. That is why the comparisons are used, they are like you but better so obviously its because you aren't working hard enough or doing what it takes to be successful. In Korea the obsession with memorization and competition has skyrocketed our suicide rate and yeah our grades are better but the cost is just too damn high."

Westerners don't look at it as winning, they look at it as cheating.\n\nBut Chinese gamers don't care that they aren't actually good at the game, they don't care that a bot aims for them or whatever.  They only care about the scoreboard and just don't feel like a fraud in the way most Westerners would because to them cheating is a valid path to success."

I was the only one brought up in America.\n\nOne programming assignment was very hard.  Some of the other students found some piece of code and copied that.  They offered it to me too, but I declined and somehow wrote up some terrible but working code myself.\n\nThe Chinese professor noticed that several of the students' code was exactly the same and was furious.  He didn't name names, but said that if it ever happened again he would fail the students in question.\n\nI always felt proud I produced original work and I know the prof noticed, he was friendlier than usual to me during office hours after that incident."

It was pretty much getting tossed in the water, and figuring it ourselves. One of the biggest things, was money. All they said was save save save save. When asked how. They said “well you save, open a savings account” and sure that’s the cut and dry of it. But they never discussed the discipline and the habit of it. This went for many things, they were full of “suggestions” but without any follow up. And I feel growing up, that’s follow up is definitely something children and teens need.
