    "text": "That’s a fantastic way to put it. We’re carrying out the characters actions, but aren’t making any big choices for them. The characters are their own people with specific motivations and ideas, and it wouldn’t really make sense for the player to be able to act against those traits."

    "text": "This is literally every game that isn't some rpg that lets you make game altering choices. Every story in every game plays the same way and has the same restrictions. I love the last of us 2 and understand some people don't like it but this is a bs excuse for people not liking the game imo.\n\nMaybe the fact that the characters actions are so polarizing is the reason they don't like the \"forced\" nature of them but every game still does it."

    "text": "Yeah, that's exactly my point. Games where the player dictates every single choice that the character makes is not the norm. It's literally just Bethesa RPG's and stuff like that. I have no idea why so many people seem to act like it's some crazy thing that you don't get to make every single choice in TLoU2."

    "text": "Yeah I watched angry joe review after. And while he makes good and positive points. He played with 3 friends taking turns all ready to hate the game before they knew what was to happen or expected with leaks to hate. A lot of people either YouTubed it or went in already wanting to hate it. Most that played whether they liked the story or not. Can’t say it doesn’t put a dent in your brain, to ask more of the current games we play. After it, I felt like most of the upcoming games just feel stupid and outdated now🤷🏻‍♂️ We can only play so many COD and Ubisoft AC style games that get 8/10 and 10/10 that come nowhere near this level of AI and gameplay....regardless of story. In a way this game ruined a lot modern day games for me, and not in a bad way. I can still play GOW or Horizion Dawn and feel fresh. But I can’t say the same now for up and coming games repurposing open worlds and beating this area then go here with a loose story thrown in. I just feel I have to demand more out of AI, game loops and environments now that TLOU2 showed off what’s possible."

If you don’t kill it, the story doesn’t progress. You’re controlling a character that without the players input, it doesn absolutely nothing so techincally their actions are yours.!<\n\nAlso, the other chokepoint >!dogs are unavoidable. The moment they spot you, they’re hostile, will attack you. So you have to kill them.!< This is just a silly comment to make about this kind of game considering the narrative is linear unlike choice RPG’s which allow the player to **not** do certain things and still progress the game."

    "text": "I was just responding to your wording of the game “making” you do these things. When I was playing it, I didn’t feel like the game was making me do anything. The one time that Ellie does kill a dog, it’s attacking her and she wouldn’t reasonably do anything else. Ellie is making these choices and the player interaction is there to hammer home the consequences of those choices."

    "text": "I understand that, but if we want to get technical with the meaning of what you do as a player and how you’re forced to do things, we gotta take into account that if we don’t do certain things, the game won’t progress. You have to hold/tap Square >!otherwise the dog kills you.!<\n\nIs all pre-determined by the writers so that you get the sense of guilt later on >!when you’re provided the dogs backstory!<\n\nI understand that this is the **only** way the story progresses so the player is in a passenger seat position, but the fulfillment of Ellies actions are left for the player to finalize which means that the player is forced to participate in **that** action.\n\nThe one game that comes to mind that had a controversial mission but allowed the player to not participate and still progress the story was CoD: MW2 in the No Russian mission. In this mission >!you gun down an airport full of civillians, but you’re not forced to do it because the game allows you to skip the mission all together and progress the story.!<"

    "text": "I think the player’s participation in those actions aren’t there as a way to make you feel guilty, but more as a way to highlight the things that Ellie is choosing to do. She has to actively make the choice to >!kill a dog, or torture someone!< and the button prompts make that clear. I really did not feel that any of that was there to make the player feel personally guilty on behalf of the character. This isn’t a game like Skyrim where the character and the player are interchangeable, and the use of multiple playable characters makes that even more clear.\n\nPlayers are given choice to the limits of what that character might choose to do. In a normal combat encounter, Ellie could conceivably choose to set up traps to blow up every dog she sees, or choose to sneak by all of them to make things easier. >!But if a dog jumps at her when she opens a door, she isn’t going to choose to not kill it.!<"
