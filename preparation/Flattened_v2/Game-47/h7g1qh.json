Source?\n\nI for instance read the spoilers but I'm still open to the game and hope it's gonna be good. In the spoilers discussions people never mentioned a need for white male protagonists, but instead of the story paths which were terrible.\n\nYou mentioned also (like a 10y child) that people have problems with women who have a strong build. Nobody said \"a woman shouldn't be like that\", but people argued how a person in that time would be able to find enough muscle sustaining food, while many are starving to death. Hunting is one argument, but all the areas are sepperated into gang regions, so someone who hunts down a big animal hast to share it. Many think Neil implemented this with a purpose to support his political views, which should never be in any game.\n\nAgain, show a source of people wanting a white male as a protagonist.

Although I will most likely buy it when it’s on sale. The people that hate it because of the LGBT stuff are insane, at least it’s different from the same straight white male protagonists/antagonists that have been used for years."

CD Projekt Red (and plenty of other studios ofc) are also guilty of crunch, but you don't see these Gamerbros talking shit about Cyberpunk or wanting it to fail.\n\nPart II is controversial because some people consider gay protagonists and muscular women to be a \"political agenda being shoved down their throat\". That's really all there is to it."

Making a AAA game is really difficult and requires millions of hours, and throwing more money and people at the problem doesn't always solve it. It doesn't even matter how far into the future the release date is because in the last few months leading up to release devs WILL face 60 hour work weeks, if they're lucky."

It's been a while since I read Schreier's article on Part II's crunch, but I recall him saying that the studio was in crunch mode over a year from release, which is just fucking insane.\n\nIt's beyond unhealthy, both for individual developers and the industry in general."

    "text": "Crunch is a topic that pops up every now and then a few months before the release of a big title. Happened with this game, happened with Red Dead 2, happened with Bioware, will probably happen with Cyberpunk again before it's out. Usually it starts with a Jason Schreier article. And it's usually forgotten about after a few weeks, until he posts another article 8 months later.\n\nCrunch is absolutely a legitimate issue, don't get me wrong. It's 1000x more damaging to the games industry than gay protagonists or whatever the fuck else Gamerbros complain about lol. The brutal crunch is driving talented developers away from Naughty Dog. But it's an issue that plagues almost all AAA studios, not just ND.\n\nI almost *wish* crunch was the reason people were upset at Naughty Dog, at least it actually matters. But no, we live in a world where Gamers get more upset about women with big arms than game developers working absolutely ludicrous hours and crunching 12+ months away from release. It's sad."

    "text": "That's just how the zeitgeist has shifted. Tons of youtubers, individuals, etc read or watch spoilers out of context from the rest of the game. They think it sucks shit, the word spreads that it sucks shit. This really isn't helped by people being rightly pissed off that ND is no exception when it comes to crunch culture. I'm of the general opinion that a similar thing likely would have happened if the first game's ending had been spoiled. Many people hated it even in context at launch so I can only imagine the outcry in 2013 if bad press like this got pushed months before launch. I'll respect the game on its own merits and hopefully it was worth being so skeptical over this long (skeptical of the criticisms)."

For me the environment and the mood were the true champions of the game, and are the reasons I still pick it up from time to time."
