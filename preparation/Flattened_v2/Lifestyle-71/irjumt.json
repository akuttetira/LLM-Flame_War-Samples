It’s sad whenever a step parent is a better parent then the biological parent (and this isn’t to say they aren’t real parents, because they definitely are)\n\nIt’s a mistake, so it should be treated like that, it’s not like you intentionally slammed it into the ground shattering the bowl. But yall need some better bowls, I’ve dropped mine probably hundreds of times and it still is fine"

    "text": "they were bowls she had for 20 years. Old and fragile. My step-mum is a strange woman. She's a woman of her time so she doesn't believe in these \"modern\" things like bisexuality or depression (I've told her I'm bi and have depression, she said I'd get over both of them eventually) but in every other way, she's kind, supportive, and probably the best parent I have"

Some people just don’t understand it I don’t think. I think it is because it was really something people talked about when she was growing up.\n\nNow it is a lot more common to talk about sexuality and mental health, so we view it differently than older people, but there are still people older that understand these things."

    "text": "Can't say much on the sexuality part, but it's understandable, and regrettably, makes sense that she doesn't understand the depression part. The only ones who will ever understand that, and I mean truly understand, are those who also suffer it.\nIt's like trying to explain a rainbow to a blind person, or why you love milk to someone who is extremely lactose intolerant (milk tastes sour to them and leaves a really bad aftertaste in their mouth, which let's them know they are in fact drinking milk and should spit it out unless they want to cry on the toilet for five hours. This reaction is, in a sense, a defense mechanism. The connection of lactose and the after effects causes you to develop, over time, a fake flag when consuming it. Or so I've been told that why it tastes like I'm drinking sour milk from three years ago no matter how fresh.)\n\nI suffer Bipolar, and my SO has severe depression, and even then, we still fail to really understand what the other is experiencing. We have minor understandings, but we still don't truly know just what to do or say in situations when we have an episode because they're completely different types of mental illnesses. We try to apply our own methods on each other and it's a coin toss at that point of success or failure.\n\nPoint being, I'm glad you don't feel resentment towards the lack of understanding. It takes time to really get it when you don't experience it, and even then, you'll never truly get it, just kinda, graze the point."

I think it's just the circle of people you socialize with.  Always try to make sure you recognize the limitations of your own experiences because in my experience the both generations have both rational and emotional (irrational) thinkers.\n\nI see more rational thinkers in my generation, but I think that's just the group I socialize with (tech people and engineers) rather than the older generation which is more relatives and neighbors.  We each have our bubble and no bubble is a true representation of the whole."

This is not an appropriate place to express your bi-phobia, your denial of real mental health issues that REALLY impact people and even kill them sometimes or to complain that the younger generations are \"just sensitive.\"\n\nI grew up in the 80's, too.  But, ya know what.... YOU LEARN BETTER AND THEN YOU CHANGE YOUR IDEAS.  Being raised in whatever decade is not an excuse to create real bigoted harm with your bigoted ideas.\n\nDo it again and I'd be happy to ban you."
