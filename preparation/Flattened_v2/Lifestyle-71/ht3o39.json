Do you guys think father's assume girls can grow without needing underwear?\n\nAnd, yes, I do have a 15 year old daughter. I really don't think her choice of under garments could be a source of embarrassment to either of us."

We were punished for trying to be our own person or feeling an emotion the narc didn't like.\n\nThis girl's father obviously knew his daughter needed to be reassured and dignified, and he did that."
