My future MIL went, “whoops! good thing we have more butter!” And nothing came of it. Nobody was mad or screaming at me. I braced myself for war for “ruining Christmas” and was met with kindness. I realized a lot of trauma I stored in my body that day in anticipation for violence! I’m glad your in-laws and hubby treat you with kindness!"

It’s amazing how what’s a good bonding moment for children of normal parents is traumatic for kids of Nparents because everything gets spun to be such a big deal"
