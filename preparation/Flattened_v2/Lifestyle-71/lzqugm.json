    "text": "I finally had a drunky with my stepmom for the last time a few years back.  I started asking her how she could X and Y and Z, and she went on the understandable defensive.  She pulled out the big guns.  “I’m not going to feel bad about your life because you were such a horrible child.”\n\nI finally said, “Bitch.  I was 10-14 through most of that mess.  You started the game at 48.  Who TF tells a kid they meet for the first time they are stupid, and then proceeds to ruin every ounce of their existence, and then sits back all “you were a horrible kid,”?  I think we’ve had about as much to say to one-another as life will allow.  Good luck to you and your addict POS son.  I hope he fails.”\n\n\nEdit: The point is, I am now the age these people were when our journey started (well I am not 48 yet, but you get the point).  And I cannot imagine how these people ever thought their behavior was acceptable.  I cannot empathize with them enough to find a justification for it."

I was just a kid, and I’d *just* gotten my leg amputated by a lawnmower.\n\nWho does that???\n\nIt truly is amazing to be an adult and to look back on these situations. I literally can’t imagine that anything was going through their mind, because they’re just shells of a human being at that point"

The last time I spoke to mine, she asked me “If things were so bad, why didn’t you leave?”\n\nLet’s see ... probably because my parents custody agreement said I HAD to live with my eDad? And because I was far too young to pack my things into a car and drive out of our town?"
