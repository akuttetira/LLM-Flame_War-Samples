    "text": "I didn’t ‘peak’ in high school but I do miss it. I loved my teachers and the social aspect of high school. It was so easy to see all of my friends and my evenings were never dull whether it be with study groups after school, playing games online or just going out to eat with my friends. Then the next day you’d get to recap the nights antics. Compared to my life now, my friends and I rarely get to catch up due to our busy schedules and when I look back to my time in high school I was definitely happier and felt that the world was my oyster."

I just wanted to offer a perspective from someone relatively normal who has an NMum and who genuinely misses high school. I def sympathise with the OP as I dealt with the same pressures and somehow got pressured into undertaking an honours law degree by my NMum but am still not good enough.. that’s a whole other kettle of fish though haha."
