You then proceeded to shit on them for taking action to try and resolve it in the best way they were able. And now you're literally taking their personal post asking for emotional support and using it to spread propaganda.\n\nI don't even disagree with your stance on policing per se, but you're being a *HUGE asshole* right now. I'm banning you for 3 days. Reflect on what is and is not an appropriate avenue to spread your views and how your tactics are counterproductive. This is not an appropriate place to spread ideology."
