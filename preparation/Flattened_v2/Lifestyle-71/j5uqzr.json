    "text": "I havent spoken to my grandmother in 11 years since she cornered 12 year old me and threatened me saying Id burn in hell watching my friends tortured for all eternity for being an atheist. (Which to her anything not Christian is Satanism)\n\nShes been on vacations with us, she was even at my mothers recovery bed after a major life threatening surgery. My mother literally begging me to talk to her. I refused.\n\nPeople in my family say shes still family. Shes my grandma and all that. Its bullshit. Its what the non boat rockers say.\n\nShe treated me like crap my whole childhood then that incident. I refuse to suffer a bigot to appease family I hardly talk to.\n\nShe may be blood related but she sure as shit will nevet be my family"

    "text": ">Its bullshit. Its what the non boat rockers say.\n\nThe analogy is wrong and DARVO-y - I think it was Polenicus who changed it to a better one. Namely, someone who is refusing to patricipate in the abusive dynamic isn't rocking the boat. The abuser is rocking it, and the enablers are counteracting that and obviously getting offended at whoever refuses, even though a far more beneficial course of action would be to boot the abuser overboard."

    "text": "Rocking the boat isnt a bad thing its situation dependant. I certainly wouldnt go around  insinuating it denys abuse. Its just a well known saying used to easily depict someone who is or isnt following their \"norm\" (cultural, familial, relationship etc) a norm which could be toxic and abusive in nature.\n\nMaybe its a cultural difference of the saying but Ive never seen it as a negative phrase.\n\nIf someones threatening you in your boat you can rock that mofo to get them gone. Its not the only  reason for \"boat rocking\" but context is a thing we posses. Standing up for yourself is gonna rock the boat but its a boat that needs a rockin.\n\nIts literally just a phrase for someone whos currently challenging the current situation and refusing to just sit by. Rock your boat, knock your abuser into the water, capsize the boat and swim to shore. Its empowering.\n\nThe only time ive seen it used negatively is when flying monkeys warn not to rock the boat. But you're the captain and you controls who stays on your boat.\n\nWhichever nomenclature you choose to go by is your own preference but dont pull up on me acting like Im an abuse denier. Its just a turn of phrase I personally use to describe myself, a boat rocker, a no shit taker, a no line tower. A person that fights for herself regardless of the convenience to the status quo.\n\nSorry if there was any confusion."
