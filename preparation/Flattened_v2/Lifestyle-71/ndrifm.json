    "text": "Good question. If a person lives long enough at a place, a simple internet search will show the town one lives in. So it is good to be aware and have a plan to call police for trespassing, keep doors/windows locked, in case the narcissist decides to do a pop-in. Or move frequently. Not sure how celebrities keep their addresses private. It would be good to know.\n\nThis all is not said to diminish the need to celebrate OPs Freedom!!!\nCongrats to OP!!! <3 Nicely done!!!"
