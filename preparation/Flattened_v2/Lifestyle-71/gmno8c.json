My friends who didn't have a controlling/verbally abusive parent growing up didn't understand why I didn't just \"move out anyway, you're an adult\". It is a very difficult thing to do, and you have my respect.\n\nBest wishes."

It is understandable and very, very hard to make the move away from your parents, especially when they have been a very prominent controlling force in your life. I am proud of you, no matter what happens after you move out.\n\nEven if you end up struggling for a bit, you didn't fail. You will succeed. Stay firm in your decision, and have confidence.\n\nGood luck"

    "text": "So did we.\n\nCongrats that you did not struggle, but for some of us, our nparents have emotionally manipulated us into think we are going to be failures without them, or whatever other narrative they fed us. And the fear it might be true can often overwhelm the part of you saying it isn't true.\n\nWe aren't staying because we want to. We stay because we struggle to take the first steps out.\n\nNote: this is not the exact experience of all of us, but it is mine and I know I am not the only one"

    "text": "This is very very on point. I've been told my whole life (my therapist was the one who enlightened me) that I will be a failure if I do not follow the ways and processes my parents believe is the path to success. I've wanted to leave for years, but only now has an opportunity came up that just might be my way out."

    "author": "Makure",
    "text": "Fun fact: I still lapse back into crippling self doubt, hearing my mom tell me that I am a failure, that I am sabotaging myself by not listening to her, and my defiance is me pushing her love away.\n\nI am very lucky that I have dear friends who remind me that it isn't true, and will help me through those phases.\n\nIf you lapse, *don't think you've failed* or anything. It is a process, and I have no idea how long it takes to finish, if ever. Don't expect that moving out will necessarily mean sunshine and daisies forever.\n\nDon't be mad or disappointed in yourself if your parents' voices come creeping back. Try to maintain the willpower to continue on your path, and don't be afraid to reach out to friends."

    "text": "That's interesting but here's the thing---before and after I left they were saying degrading and negative inferences and implications, the whole 9 yards.  However when I got myself out the door, at least I could control more things including not listening to that crap.  I was low contact for many many years (40) My mistake was not going full NC right off the bat.  I just prolonged the agony of listening to all this negative stuff.\n\nBack to basics---my first motivation was to escape in any way possible.  Anything had to be better, and it was...even living next door to someone where they tried to break the neighbor's door down with an ax.  I guess for me the most important thing is to get away.  You have the rest of your life to thing about not making it!!! Seriously.  Once you get away your thinking will taking a big leap toward clarity."
