Also male circumcision results in a little decreased sensitivity, but done right no pain, not even discomfort.\n\nCompare that to FGM which has immediate and permanent extreme health risks."

If reaching out isn’t working, get out of that house! You could die from a surgery like that from a hack doctor. Windows can be broken, doors can be kicked down, weapons can be made out of the random stuff in your room. If the local police and neighbors already won’t help then keep running until you’re not local anymore."

Anything and everything can go through the window. Clear all the glass if you can, in case you can just make an exit.\n\nIf you can break a window, you can be heard, and if you can be heard, you can scream \"Fire!\". Set a little fire if you can, but being honest, no one is going to take a chance on a house fire. If they can't smell smoke, they'll assume it's because they can't smell it yet. Do NOT worry about whether the fire department will be mad about being called to a non-existent fire -- they're there for life or death emergencies, and yours is life or death."

A locked window is only as good as the rock used to break it. You absolutely can get out. Running away isn't the best advice, there's plenty of better advice on this thread, but this sub is one more resource for you to explore if all else fails.\n\nIf you need a silver lining, also consider that if she goes through with this, then you can file a lawsuit against her, the doctor, and the clinic, after you turn 18. I learned about this due to the nature of my own work. I believe you have until you are 21 to file a lawsuit for harm done to you as a minor. I'm not a lawyer, but you'll need to consult one to file the suit anyway.\n\nFor goodness sake though, please do everything you can to get out of this situation. Don't believe her when she says you can't run away. She's been lying to you your entire life. Get out of that house and tell an adult what's going on. Teachers, in particular, are suited to help you."
