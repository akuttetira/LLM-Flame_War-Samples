    "text": "This comment has been removed. It's lovely to hear that you've overcome a lot of these advantages, but it's also important to be considerate to those who have had different journeys and to make sure we're showing empathy towards them right now. Most people don't even realize their situation is abusive and not normal until many years later, sometimes well into their 30s, 40s and 50s. Some people might have access to these practical resources, but they might have developed crippling depression or anxiety from their abuse, and don't even know what their career goals are from being so restricted. Some are held back by guilt, or a feeling of obligation towards their abuser. Many don't have a support system in their extended family or friends to take on these roles for them.\n\nThere is no deadline for healing, and right now, this is a moment to support those people who have had longer healing journeys - to remind them that, even if they didn't achieve an Ivy League University or take advantage of all the resources that were available to them (due to either lack of knowledge or lack of motivation with depression/mental illnesses or lack of a support system), they are still worthy. It's amazing that you discovered that this version of success was still accessible to you and I'm certain it wasn't easy, but it isn't great to imply that this version of career success is available to all. This is especially when you recognize that your support system (of at least 4 adults) and your ability to display some level of self love and motivation were essential in this journey. This is a support group, so people are not always looking for tips - most people have already lived these experiences, and are looking for validation and comfort."

    "text": "Your experiences are absolutely valid, but there is a problem in assuming that material success is available for all abuse victims on a certain deadline, especially when it doesn't take into consideration things like mental illness, poverty, their location in the world, etc. It's not really your place to say what will and won't be comforting to others, and the feedback on your original comment speaks for itself. Sometimes we can have good intentions and think that we're helping, when we're indeed hurting - unfortunately, the original comment does tread the line on toxic positivity and includes certain values like prioritizing material value (getting into a certain kind of university) over the mental and emotional well being of abuse victims, and is clearly not taking into consideration the fact that most of our victims have already passed the point of being 18 and aren't necessarily looking for tips on how to get into Ivy League schools.\n\nAgain, sharing your personal experiences is totally okay. But every abuse victim has a very unique and individual journey. Assuming your experience applies to others' journeys or that you know what's best for their healing is not super appropriate."

    "text": "Your experience absolutely could resonate with somebody, which is why I am reiterating that I do encourage you to share your experiences on here. But because the original comment included other generalizations, it was removed. A comment doesn't need to be entirely bad to warrant a removal, sometimes one badly worded sentence is enough to make it triggering or hurtful. You're free to edit the comment focusing on your own experiences without speaking for others (without using sentences like \"what *we* can to do\", \"what *we* need to realize\", and say things more along the lines of \"what was important for *me* in *my* journey*\"*, etc.).\n\nIf you'd still like to contest this removal, please use modmail so we don't continue to derail this discussion for OP."
