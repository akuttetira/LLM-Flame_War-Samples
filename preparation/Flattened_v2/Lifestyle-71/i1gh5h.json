They'll say, \"look at the successful kid I raised!\" I'm gonna show them the type of kid they raised. It may be incredibly ignorant, but I need to prove to them that they were disgusting parents. Like that quote that says it takes a whole village to raise a child, but the child will burn the village down just to feel it's warmth, and I intend to do just that."

I can still rebel about their bullshit but I can give myself a nice life. I’m my own success because I’m glad they won’t see me that way."

And when they try to pull the old \"look at what a great job we done\" publicly, and very loudly and proudly proclaim \"if I had done what you taught, I'd be dead or in prison. This is MY achievement that I done on my own. You done nothing but prevent me from reaching my fullest potential so if I've succeeded even a little bit, it's because I taught myself how to even after you tried your darned hardest to set me up for failure\"\n\n\nYou are worth more than you realise, don't let those smug pricks take away any satisfaction from your life, they've done enough of that.\n\nVirtual hugs for you."

You might not be able to reach everyone’s definition of success, but you probably have something you can be proud of."

I'm still financially dependent on my n-family to a degree and that really bothers me that I have to say that at 30. (Though I'm almost free--and was very close until Covid hit me and now I am functionally disabled for the foreseeable future.)\n\nI have goals but they seem pretty far away when they always come second to making just enough money to tread water (even with a master's). :| But, I suppose there is some good in there, at least."

    "text": "Wow, didn’t expect such a late response.  😋  I would hope you like your job a fair amount, especially if you have a master’s degree in your field.  Is it a job where you work with people, or more of a technical job?  My job is mostly technical, but with enough social aspects that I could learn how to talk to people while I’m working.  I kind of used it as practice for learning how to meet new people and build relationships with them.\n\nIf you’re passionate about your job, you might also define success as doing your job well.  If it’s a job that’s not very well paid, but makes a difference in the lives of others, I’d certainly be proud of that.  If it’s a job with lots of potential for growth, focus on gaining experience and building a career out of it.  Following that path is something to be proud of, as well."
