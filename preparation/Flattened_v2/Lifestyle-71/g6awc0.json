    "text": "On the flip side, sometimes you listen to other people that make your parents look like saints, no matter how sinister they were. It's all about perspective.\n\nI'm not trying to downplay your treatment, because I can relate. I know my parents are flawed, but, after thousands of miles and time away from them, I believe they honestly did the best they possibly could. Their best wasn't great, it wasn't even very caring or loving, but inherited family trauma is a real thing, and what they gave me was all they could offer (at the time and now... they still are cold as ice, unsupportive, and borderline cruel). The cycle can break with you!"

How long does one hold onto that anger?  I believe, for as long as they need, to overcome it.\n\nI'm just starting my journey of discovering who I am.  Not what I am.  Oh sure, I'm a mother, and a wife, and a <insert profession here>, but who am *I*?  I realized today, that I don't really know who that is.  Somewhere along the way, I've just done the things that were expected of me and forgot that I am a person with dreams and needs, too.  Idk who I am right now, but I'm excited to find out.  I DO know, that I am tired of reacting to life, and I want to live it, to my fullest potential.\n\n\nThis disconnect from my dreams, is ending."
