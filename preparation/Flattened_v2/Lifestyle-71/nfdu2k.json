I didn’t tell her, because since I realized she’s a narcissist, I keep my personal information personal 😆 She’s anti vaccination 💉, she told me that she would be disappointed with me if I had vaccine made of aborted fetuses, full of nanorobots to control minds, and she claimed that to be vaccinated meant to be damned. My 2nd dose is gonna be on the first week of June. Batshitcrazy Nmother won’t be informed."

I will not be talking about vaccines” over and over again. Of course she still does and I work hard to not get too triggered each time. But lately I’ve had some fun with it by responding to each insane conspiracy video/article with links about the source being phoney and the actual facts based on legitimate science and research. It doesn’t change her opinion but it still feels kinda good. Not sure what that says about me 😬"

Case in point, I never got a flu shot or a gardasil shot until college because they didn’t believe in me getting it unless it was required. My mom even said she didn’t believe in getting a flu shot because she doesn’t believe in the reasoning behind putting a piece of the flu into you. (Even if that’s basically what a vaccine is in the first place lol).\n\nHonestly I think my moms scared of needles but that’s neither here nor there.\n\nThey all got the vaccine, but they won’t let my sister get it unless it’s required even if she’s 12.  She just got a flu shot last year."

I didn’t know back then that they were disordered. Although it feels good to stand up for yourself 👍🏻👏🏻"

There's a certain set of political beliefs that revolve around condemning and controlling people different from them, and they've gotten very popular in my country with narcissists in the past 5 years. I remember when a certain politician took power and narcissists went absolutely batshit for him and his justifications for his harmful and cruel actions, discussion of politics was banned on this subreddit after he took power. I didn't think that made sense, because the narcissist and their justification of harmful abusive beliefs are one and the same and cant be divorced."

My nMother has called my enabler brother a racist because he has opposing views from her on immigration.  Keep in mind, that my daughter which he adores is mixed and that for several years we lived in a border state.  We have seen the effects of immigration policies up close.  Plus, my daughter's father's family legally immigrated and hold the same views.\nDon't even get me started on my nGandmother...she was heavily involved in politics and that party all thought she was great.  Basically, did a lot of damage to her children and grandchildren.  Sure, a great party person but an absolute wreck of a human being.  Narcissistic  people came do damage that extends for generations.\nPersonally, as to politics I could care less what party.  I vote for the best candidate.  Unfortunately, at times it a choice between the lessor of two evils."
