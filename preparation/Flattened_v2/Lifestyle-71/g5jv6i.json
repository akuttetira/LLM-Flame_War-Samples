And thank you for your reply.\n\n> they KNOW it’s going to set off my anxiety and make me stress all day uncontrollably.\n\nMy boyfriends mother is undoubtedly a control freak and a neat freak, but she is kind hearted. I highly doubt she actually means me any harm. And I have so far not spilled the beans that I have PTSD, and when she says these things, that it gives me anxiety.\n\n> It’s fucking cruel\n\nYou are absolutely right. If it were a narcissist doing this, I’d resonate with this comment completely. My narcissist father is the reason I feel this way, and again, I don’t think she knows.\n\nHere’s the deal. She makes LISTS and NOTES of what she wants to talk to us about so she doesn’t forget. waits till they add up a bit, then says “we need to talk later.” It drives me absolutely insane.\n\nBut i’m living under her roof, by the grace of her, because my own family is abusive. So i don’t want to do anything that could cause any friction between us. And Ibdont want to step on her toes. That’s why i’m afraid to bring up the idea of asking her to change something about herself that is likely just a force of habit."

Tell her you don't want to change anything about herself, but that you really want her to be aware that she's accidentally triggering you. That her conversations are minor, but you have extreme anxiety that it won't be minor because your life trained you that phrase is going to turn into something terrible. How much you appreciate that she is such a kind, thoughtful person and you know she doesn't mean anything by it.\n\nCompliment sandwich, so to speak. Tell her you appreciate her, give her bad news, then follow up with more appreciation.\n\nEven suggestions such as \"I made some notes for later\" or \"I have a list so I didn't forget\" could say the same thing without triggering you in an intense way. Rational people will trip on changes like this, but they don't consider it an attack on their character."

    "text": "I'm so sorry you're having to deal with this. It was the same for me growing up, and my Nmother and I have fought over the phone/text so many times I also have anxiety about getting a text or call, or even notifications sometimes. It's super draining and brutal. Sometimes I have to ignore all texts/calls/messages for days at a time before I feel okay about it again. Luckily my friends are aware of this and are supportive.\n\nAnd getting into the whole \"I have anxiety. No, actual anxiety that greatly impacts my day-to-day and overall quality of life,\" is so shitty and frustrating. It might help if you just let her know that it's making you uncomfortable. Maybe you won't have to deal with all the explaining BS. Another thing that helps me is repeating to myself that they're not my Nparent, they're my BFs amazing mom. That I'm out of that situation and I don't need to be afraid or hyper-aware anymore. That my BFs mom is different and doesn't deserve to be perceived the same as my Nparent. Obviously that is the tricky part. If we could all think our way out if anxiety it wouldn't be a problem, but I find the repetition finally helps drill it home, and over time it's easier for me to calm myself and not associate others with my Nparent.\n\nI hope she listens easily and everything is resolved without much fuss. Hang in there and good luck."

Good enough that you would feel comfortable talking to her about how this is a problem for you? If this phrase isn't an issue for her, there is a good chance that your kind of reaction has never occurred as a possibility to her.\n\nI really encourage you to ask her to stop doing this. It doesn't have to be confrontational. You don't have to reveal your whole history. You can say, \"I know it might feel like a small thing, but when you tell me that you want to talk to me later without telling what you want to talk about it really gives me anxiety and I'd appreciate if you'd either tell me the thing in the moment or tell me what the topic for later it.

My dad took me out to dinner a few years back and had a complete breakdown over the past. He was crying at the table and profusely apologized for what he had done. We are on decent terms though I only see him every few years. Mom never apologized, but she’s also changed for the positive as a person. I keep her at a distance as well, but I’m glad I things have changed. I chose to never be a father because of how I was brought up, and I believe it was the best choice for me (I do have a daughter I met when she was a teen and we are good friends)."

But when he did that a few times after, I just got more agitated.\n\nHe doesn't do that anymore. I know how much anxiety I had to go through till I could safely get away for a few minutes to make the call. A lot of people don't actually understand this and it can be hard for them to empathise with our situations. And it's hard for us to explain WHY we feel so anxious.

He was about to mentally beat me down and make me feel like a horrible person for some stupid little thing he decided to make an issue of. I was right.
