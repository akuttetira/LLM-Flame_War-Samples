I highly suggest start calling her a little bitch at life for giving into such ways of shitty human living standards just cause she a was a little pussy to run away from people she knew were terrible to her.\nBasically you have to become not her son but her friend now.  Thats i did it with my folks and now we're the best of friends.\nRun your tongue off and if she attacks be prepared to defend yourself.  Just dont hurt her.\nI personally pushed both my father to the floor laughed at his face and told him he was a bitch and then left to a friends house.\nYou need to gain respect and the only way to ruin a bully is to bully back"
