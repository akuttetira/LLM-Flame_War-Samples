    "text": "My mom doesn't talk to me for a week.. And if I try to say aynthing she just won't hear it. It makes me so unheard and has definitely given me a lot of anxiety when I can't express my emotions to people or explain why I'm hurt. Any time I tell my mom I'm hurt or what she said is wrong or unfair, she says I'm too sensitive and that she can't open her mouth to say anything about me.\n\nAnd the same as you. If mine loses an argument or refuses to acknowledge that somethign she did js wrong and my dad and I are against her, she thraterns suicide and that I should get a replacement mother and she should kill herself. It's heartbreaking and really takes a toll on me and my father. She's not bad most of the time but it seems anything can set her off, even somwthing just said in the wrong way. I need to move out soon.\n\nEdit: I should mention that I'm the only child and my dad just takes all of her abuse and maltreatment. My parents are great and all but she can just have this side to her. I stand up for myself and try not to take. Her abuse whenever it comes up, and then dad always bends to what she says and I get yelled at and called horrible things for standing my ground. Hope that explains a bit better."

My dad is the same way.\n\nMy mom literally left him at one point when I was a teenager, and then a year later she ran out of money and came crawling back and he just let her back into the house with open arms. They're basically just roommates now, but he still bends to her every wish. It's sad because we both almost got rid of her when she left for that year...\n\nEdit: typo"

    "text": "Bahahaha. Not a chance. We've gone therapy before and it DESTROYED her. She realized the problem was her and that my dad and I were right in calling her unfair and unjust. It broke her world to hear it from another person's perspective that wasn't her immideate family.. \"if you ever call me bipolar or a control freak, I'm leaving\".parents married 35 years. Honestly I've got it pretty great, but this has been recurring my entire life.\n\nShe's pretty central to my father and I's lives despite this. She's OK 90% of the time, but anything can set her off. The wrong look, wrong voice tonality, a dish in the sink... (beginnig to realize that having extreme anxiety over a dish in the sink or a hair/crumb on the floor isn't normal... What the fuck... Right?)\", too slow to answer her.. not willing to bend to her command and morally demean myself... The list goes on.\n\nShe's had so many surgeries through her whole life and is on so many medications now I don't know if they've had a permenant effect on her brain. and keeps using things 5-20 years in the last to justify herself use hand picks bad examples of me way in my past to shame me. I'm fit. Strong. Handsome. Make 100k+/yr... It's literally like I'm Arnold and I have a little old lady constantly bitching at me and constantly demeaning my manhood and the things I enjoy. A guy like that wouldn't let a little old angry lady control his life, I'm about done with it. Imagine my psychological implications. I'm constantly shamed for going out, exercising, hiking, playing games... All my friends love and look up to me... Yet I'm useless as a man and 'good luck finding someone who likes you' and.. 'someone's going to HIT you someday'.. It's awful. Never got in a fight with a friend or someone, and when I do argue/debate with someone, I've always been able to see it from a 3rd party view and different perspective and empathize or rationalize their or my own viewpoint. Pretty level-headed, right? She completley lacks these traits and only sees for herself, yes calls me selfish when I don't want to help her with something she could easily do herself, or she will simply ask me to do something irrelevant for her when she KNOWS I'm busy and don't want to help. Like the other day I made breakfast. I'm walking around going my morning stuff.. First thing out of her mouth is... \"why didn't you cook any for me?\". I seriously WTF? That's a llse-lsoe questions, and nothing good can come of it. She says these things to attack without purpose and I have nothing to defend, so she just constantly trips me and I even feel guilty for making myself BREAKFAST sometimes. I feel like I've been denied and repressed so much.\n\nI realize this was a long comment and not many people may read.. But I got up early this morning and it felt good to have a quiet house where I can type madly. Comments or replies are greatly appreciated.. Thank you for your time reading."

A guy like that wouldn't let a little old angry lady control his life, I'm about done with it. Imagine my psychological implications\n\nIt's good you're not letting her influence your life.  I do actually get it, my mother has NPD and frankly, could be a sociopath.  For years I hoped she had BPD.  It's so interesting how she reacted to therapy.\n\nTotally understand what you mean by the fear.  When I was a teenager, when my mom came through the front door I would instantly feel extreme panic (and she's 5'3 and like 100 pounds).  I would be focusing on how her footsteps sounded and trying to predict when the screaming would start or if I could relax for a bit.\n\nI always thought if I could just get her to therapy it could fix our family and I hoped so much it was BPD (which isn't exactly any easier to deal with but at least it doesn't mean they're actually 100% evil).  BPD a lot of times has narcissistic personality problems in it anyway.\n\nMy sister, and my husband (who has a mom that sounds more like yours but they are different with sons) have been struggling (as well as me!) to actually let go of the guilt you feel with actually saying 'look I need to cut you off because you are psychologically damaging'.  It's the hardest thing ever because you just want to help them, feel responsible for them, want to keep your family together and always think you can take it and it isn't that bad (in my experience anyway).\n\nThis book was SUPER helpful for me and my husband, someone from Reddit actually suggested it.  [https://www.amazon.com/Narcissistic-Mothers-Children-Narcissists-Recovery/dp/1695206681](https://www.amazon.com/Narcissistic-Mothers-Children-Narcissists-Recovery/dp/1695206681)\n\nI eventually had to cut my mom off.  But I only did this when she tried to destroy my Dad and I was worried he would die, never because of what she did to me or my sister.  I keep thinking if I'd done this at age 18, would I have been better off?"

I told him that I had nothing to apologise for so I would not be apologizing just because the conversation upset her and did not go the way she wanted. I told him she would have to apologize to me, that she was in the wrong and I didn't not believe that I, as a full grown 26 year old adult, should have to apologize for telling someone off for trying to control me and my public opinion."
