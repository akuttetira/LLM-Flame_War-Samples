Though she wasn’t the one who provided, my dad did, she would still threaten to take away everything should I disobey or if she perceived me to disobey.\n\nI once hung out with someone she didn’t like and tried to take my phone from me because she paid for the plan. Since I was 18 I just went ahead and moved to my own plan. And it went like that up until she threatened to kick me out, so I just moved out only to be told “she cries every night because you left” - when she’s the one that told me I should.\n\nThis abuse has led to me NEVER asking for help, no matter how much I need it, because I’m afraid of\n\na) the person holding that help over my head, essentially making me their puppet because I owe them or\n\nb) being flat out ignored or treated like I’m being a burden for doing so\n\nI wonder if nparents really know the extent of the damage they cause but even if they did they wouldn’t care and that’s what breaks me."

Our rent house is being sold and I’ve been having trouble finding a place that allows pets, which means I may have to move back with them for a short time until something pops up. I told them that I will clean, pay rent, and take care of all of the pets (theirs and mine) because of the generosity. She just gave me a funny look and was like “honey, no need for that! You’re family and we’ll take care of you no matter what” and I literally broke down and cried because I’m not used to a parental figure being so kind just because. My dad can’t fathom why she hates my bio mom lol."

I arranged to stay at a friends house but their parents called mine to make sure it was okay, though I explicitly told them the situation, and my mom literally laughed on the phone to them and said she never said that and I must be crazy. I got so depressed that I didn’t leave my room except for school and work for 3 years until I moved out. I still hang out in my room all day and have to remind myself that I’m allowed to move in my own home. It’s so absurd how they treat those closest to them and the more I think about it the sadder I get because, even though I don’t want children, I can’t imagine treating any child that way.

For the longest time I thought being provided for in material things was what love is. I don't know how and when to give someone a hug because after the age of 10 or so my mom decided that solutions were superior to being comforting, because a hug doesn't solve your problems. My mom made me into a personal therapist/sonhusband to replace the emotional support my dad never gave her so I hardly even know what being a child even is. She manipulated me into thinking I would find very few people I would connect with because of my superior intelligence, but she of course is one of those few. Demoralised my efforts to start dating and finding a job, just so I would need her rather than be independent. But I got toys and treats and vacations right so I must have had a wonderful childhood!\n\nThe way you have put up boundaries is very good and I admire your strength!"

I'm glad still that this has come to light because this would have set me up for some terrible relationships down the line.

They listen to you, and then transform into what you want them to be.

After I started flight training back in 2017, her next threat was \"I'm going to tell your dad to stop paying for your training\".\nWhenever I act a certain way she does not like, or do something she likes to say \"I don't know how you expect to become a pilot\" trying to humiliate me as if pilots were part of the elite or something.\n\nLast year I managed to get a job at a callcenter. It was only €5/hour but it felt good to have my own money.\nMy dad complained everyday about it. Saying I wasn't getting paid enough, that I should quit, that he would give me more than I earn every month if I just quit.\nHe ended up forcing me to quit after 3 months by planning a vacation that he also forced me to go to.\nHe knew my boss wouldn't let me get 2 weeks leave after only 3 months in the company.\nObviously he didn't follow through with his promises, and just wanted to have full financial control over me.\n\nSo even though I get abused daily, they find a way to make me feel guilty because they're paying for my education and my future. I am expected to just deal with it because he takes us on expensive vacations.\nI can't complain about anything because I need to be grateful.\nAll of my younger siblings have their own rooms, decorated and furnished while I sleep downstairs on a couch in the guest room because it would be a waste of money to just get me a bed and some curtains.\n\nHoping that everyone in a similar situation finds peace and is able to get away from the abuse.

People see differences as wrong and it shouldn't be. It should be great! It should be a pleasure to meet someone different from you. I hope I'm not alone in that. I don't think I am. But so many people seem to celebrate hate instead of love. Celebrate every time something bad is done, but not when something good happens.\n\nI'm doing that... like I said I'm a hypocrite.\n\nI don't know how to heal myself but I have mostly love for everyone else. Why?\nWhy can't I do that for me.\n\nSorry...\n\nEvery time I see someone telling how n parents behaviors aren't normal I... realize how badly I ruined my life by not realizing it and not knowing how to help myself.\n\nSorry."
