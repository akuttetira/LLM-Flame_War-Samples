You have tons of games with easy difficulty, where you just relax and don't have to worry about 'losing', and you have tons of games that are extremely difficult that players find an immense satisfaction in overcoming. What games you like or don't like depends on the kind of person you are to a degree.\n\nOr are you just referring to this life as the 'first level'? You can lose in lots of games, but you can just retry until you win. The purpose of the game isn't to judge your moral character, and the purpose of life isn't just to entertain."

I genuinely don’t understand what you don’t understand, even after reading your comment repeatedly.  I’m confused by your claim that you have no idea what he’s talking about.\nIn your reply above it sounds like you are saying that this judging of our moral character matters infinitely more than what happens in a video game. I would grant that premise to get to the next.\nYet the life circumstances of each person that gains consciousness IS given a random roll of the dice as to how much reliable information they will have initial access to to make a judgment call on whether or not that person is going to heaven or hell.\nI don’t think OP was saying that the purpose of life was entertainment.  He was saying you would never willingly play a game designed by that god with as badly designed as this reality would be had that god designed it. Until there’s evidence of design then it’s kind of a big shrug otherwise the way I see it.\n\nedit: typo and clarification"

Not to mention people in general will have different innate skills better able to handle some games but not others.\n\nWe learn in Romans that no man has an excuse, and that every person *can* be saved, even if just by observing nature and concluding the nature of its creator. But the you gave millions of people who grow up surrounded by the Word of God yet do not become saved, and in fact that’s pretty much 99% of every atheist on this sub I’d reckon. That’s like getting good RNG but then blaming the game when you lose. My only advice then is: git gud."

Yahweh could be the stupidest god that’s ever existed and we exist out of pure luck and chance from somehow avoiding his ineptitude. You have no evidence to prove this idea I just pulled out of my bum is false.\n\n99% of atheists eh?  Sounds about as baseless as the rest of your comment.  Your arrogance is only warranted if your god actually exists.  He has yet to be shown to exist in any reasonable way.  You have no evidence for his existence.  Come on back when you got more than Bible verses and self righteousness."

Because games are designed to be challenging, yet receiving salvation is super easy, and Jesus did all the hard stuff for us. Not being saved is like failing in a tutorial that is 100% hand holding.\n\nThe challenge comes after salvation of course. But again, if a person isn’t saved then I reckon they aren’t as aware of that. I’m not sure where you get the idea that it would be ‘stupid game design’ though, other than you just having an axe to grind of course.\n\nI am pretty confident in my statement that ~99% of atheists on this sub have been exposed to the means of salvation though, lol."

But you are wasting my time with the rest of this tripe so I’ll give you a 50% on this comment.\n\nI can tell you think yer pretty clever though lol.  For a Christian, you might be.  For a prideful, arrogant, self-righteous person, definitely super duper clever.  For a thinking person who actually cares whether or not their beliefs are actually true, I wouldn’t even think to use the word clever to describe anything you’ve typed.\nGames are not always designed to be challenging.  I guess we will file that little nugget of cluelessness under your brand of cleverness.\nLol, if I was Jesus I’d think you were such a jerk the way you talk about his “sacrifice” and how “easy” receiving salvation is.  It may be easy for you to believe ridiculous baseless claims.  For me, it’s not easy to believe things for which there’s no good reason or evidence to warrant belief.  I guess we are different in that way.  It might explain why you claim to know things you could not know and why you are so reluctant to give any actual evidence for these extraordinary supernatural claims beyond personal, anecdotal, experience.  Claiming to know something and then providing absolutely no reason or evidence for its truthfulness just sounds like lying to me.  I really don’t prefer to engage with dishonest interlocutors so please stop lying to me if possible.  If it’s not possible, I’ll understand and just chok it up to adherence to an immoral belief system.\n\nCome on back when you have some evidence for your supernatural claims.  Until such evidence is presented, I will keep christianity and whatever you call your claims here, right where it belongs, filed under imaginary.\n\nI know you are still confident that your gross over generalization is correct about atheists but thankfully it’s beyond irrelevant.  So now you’re only “pretty confident” about your claim  about atheists now eh?  Any progress towards you being truthful is welcome.  Unlike you, I won’t lie and claim that I can speak with authority about the mind of 99%+ of atheists because I’m not as arrogant and prideful as you continue to demonstrate yourself to be.  What I can do, is I can say that I personally have not been presented with any reasonable, rational, evidence-based supernatural claim from any god that exists that actually rings true.  So far, there is no evidence for the existence of yahweh that should convince anyone that isn’t already convinced.\n\nIt’s all smoke, mirrors and assumptions when it comes to christianty.  None of you have ever presented anything remotely convincing besides this self-righteous none sense.  If there was any evidence of the truthfulness of any supernatural claim in the bible, we would not be having this conversation.  I would be a christian.  Unlike the way you present yourself here, I am ready and willing to change my mind, but all your low level, amateur hour apologist weaksauceness is boring.  Tell me something I haven’t heard a million times from believers already.\nMake a good argument and/or present a shred of evidence for just 1 supernatural claim of christianity.  If your next comment sucks as much as every one of your last ones, I’m not gonna engage beyond asking you to provide evidence for your claims.\n\nThen you can either provide it, or just wisely choose silence and jog on."

Usually I end up typing long responses to relatively short comments, but seems we got the opposite here.\n\nI can probably provide you with evidence. But first I would like you to define evidence, *exactly*. This way we can know with 100% certainty what we are discussing, and we can work from there.\n\nIf you can’t define evidence, or otherwise refuse to, then your diatribe about there being no evidence would seem to be hallow axe grinding after all."

That’s the only way you can ‘win debates’ it seems."

    "text": "As expected, you claim to have supernatural beliefs and abilities(knowing this gods mind) but you have zero evidence to make these claims.\nI’m not demanding anything.  I’m asking for you to provide evidence and you refuse to do so. You can try and split hairs about what kind of evidence would convince me all you want.  But until you offer up what your evidence is for why YOU believe something unsupported by the measurable nature of reality, then you need to present it so I can ask clarifying questions. But if you’re afraid to share your evidence I can understand that too.  Pearls before swine and all that rot amirite???\nI know you think I’ll change the standard of evidence, but the only thing that could cause that is if you present bad evidence.  Examples of bad evidence include but are not limited to: personal anecdotal experience, bible verses.  As an example, both of these types of evidence are bad because neither are evidence at all.  Both examples are only the supernatural claims.  They do not count as evidence because they cannot stand up to even mild scrutiny. This is more clarification than you deserve at this point.\nI’m not going to define evidence past the way I already have just now and the several times I have before because you would only keep moving the goal post until I said you could use bad evidence.  It is not my fault if you have not understood what I have plainly said many times already.  It does make me think that you have not been reading anything I’ve written in good faith at all.  You have demonstrated yourself to be a dishonest interlocutor several times now.\n\nDo you believe that your god will reward you for lying on his behalf?  This is a more rhetorical question because I have a good idea what you will say to that and it’s likely to just be another lie.  I know some religionists who believe in “lying for the lord”.  The ends may justify the means from where you sit.  I understand why religionists lie and then lie to themselves about those lies.  It’s really necessary when you have no evidence for your beliefs and you want to believe them anyway.\n\nBut for me, I actually care whether or not my beliefs are true so I engage with people so they can HOPEFULLY show me something I may have overlooked.  But almost always, all I ever get are the likes of you dodging constantly and refusing to back up their baseless claims.  You guys are all pretty basic in my experience.  I know that doesn’t mean any of you actually ARE as basic as you demonstrate yourselves to be, because I recognize that a singular personal anecdotal experience is not enough to claim to have special knowledge.  You guys seem to relish every opportunity to pretend to know things that you do not know and then refusing to provide actual evidence to back the claims up.\nEither you have evidence or you don’t. The only thing you have demonstrated is that you have none.  But cry about it some more and keep making excuses as to why you cannot provide any actual evidence for your claims.  Maybe this will motivate you, though I doubt it.  You don’t strike me as a true christian.  I’m gonna go to hell because you have failed miserably to teach me about your gods plan of salvation!  This is why I suspect you aren’t a real christian. You seem motivated by pride and arrogance. If you truly cared about my soul as your god expects you to, then you wouldn’t be such a lame-o with all your responses.\nI will say yet again that I care that my beliefs are ACTUALLY true.  I am truly sorry, but you do not seem as though you care if yours are true.   You clearly seem like you just prefer to be a christian.  I’ve tried to ask you for evidence but all I get is complaints, more baseless claims, reiterated baseless claims, whining, and goal post moving. Typical af.\nJust like always, please present some actual evidence or accept that you can’t and kindly go away.\n\nEdit: phrasing was bad."

    "text": "Ah, I wasn’t prior aware of this but this sub’s rules say to use the SEP for definitions by default. So we’ll just use that. The SEP provides a LOT of discussion and theory on what ‘evidence’ means, but the general trend among all of them is that evidence is something which justifies belief.\n\nOf course, then we are left to wonder how we can quantify whether something ‘justifies’ belief. There isn’t an objective method of doing so. The closest thing to a ‘justification’ of belief would simply be the presence of belief itself. That is, if somebody believes X, then whatever they personally think *justifies* that belief *is* evidence. So basically, evidence is reason for belief.\n\n“Reason for belief”. That is the definition of evidence we shall work with, until you bother to provide an alternative definition.\n\nIn that case, the universe is sufficient reason to believe in a creator, just as a painting is evidence of an artist. Because I see the universe, I have reason to believe it has a creator. Our human understanding sees complex things, and we conclude that they are a result of design. A painting. A skyscraper. Stonehenge. Anthills. Even such simple things as two rocks on top of one another. These things imply designers, and indeed they *are* designed. In that sense, it is reasonable to extend this ides to the entire universe.\n\nThe universe is complex and works within the boundaries of rules. Thus, it is reasonable to believe it was designed that way, just like Stonehenge. In this sense, apparent design within our universe is evidence for a designer; a creator.\n\nYou could argue “Maybe it happened randomly” since random chance is the *only* alternative to design, but then you would be staring down the challenge of also demonstrating that Stonehenge was not designed but rather the result of ‘random chance’, or that the Mona Lisa was not designed but rather a result of random chance.\n\nSo there you have it. According to the definition of evidence which we are using, there is evidence for a designer/creator. Congratulations."

    "text": "Thank you for finally trying.  Everything we know about reality is based on comparison to other things.  This universe is the only known universe to exist.  We do not have a “created” universe to compare to a “natural” universe so we cannot tell the difference between a universe where a god exists and one that does not.  There, refuted.\n\nThe “laws” of physics are not laws in the traditional sense as in something created by someone.  The “laws” of nature are not created, they are observed, tested repeatedly to determine how likely a particular claim is. Also refuted.\n\nYou are making a huge amount of assumptions based on your limited perspective in order to believe your claims. This explains all I need to know about your position.  It may be convincing to you, but it is not to me.  I worked my way through this group of bad arguments years ago.  No one since has offered new information/understanding.  Same ole, same ole.  I will need to hear new things or old things presented differently.\n\nAs it stands, this is not great evidence.  Your entire argument seems to boil down to “I can’t imagine a way this universe could exist without a god”.  That’s a fallacy of personal incredulity and it’s beneath us.  Well, me anyway.\nEven if I granted the idea that A god exists and created the universe, you’d then still have all of your work ahead of you to prove that that god is Yahweh.\n\nYou think you have good evidence but you present me with your inability to see anything besides what you already wanted to believe.  Convenient though, I admit.  Got anything else?"
