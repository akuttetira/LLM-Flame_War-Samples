Later this progressed & he went to war with the archangels of heaven alongside his own demon creations. Archangel Michael defeated Lucifer and all evil in this war then he was sent to the underworld by God..\n\nWhen humans were created on earth, Lucifer corrupted life with sin. Since God knows temptations of sin will be in our lap & that we are human & not perfect, he is merciful for he is a loving and forgiving god. I feel like God tests your faith in him in many situations in life.. although he knows the outcome. For God is also a God of Law and Righteousness, he also punishes."

    "text": "Satan’s fall from heaven is symbolically described in Isaiah 14:12-14 and Ezekiel 28:12-18. While these two passages are referring specifically to the kings of Babylon and Tyre, they also reference the spiritual power behind those kings, namely, Satan. These passages describe why Satan fell, but they do not specifically say when the fall occurred. What we do know is this: the angels were created before the earth (Job 38:4-7). Satan fell before he tempted Adam and Eve in the Garden (Genesis 3:1-14). Satan’s fall, therefore, must have occurred somewhere after the time the angels were created and before he tempted Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Whether Satan’s fall occurred hours, days, or years before he tempted Adam and Eve in the Garden, Scripture does not specifically say."

    "text": ">they also reference the spiritual power behind those kings, namely, Satan.\n\nNot true. Any symbolic meaning is far reaching. We have no reason to believe the passages are meant for anything other than the people they are aimed at. Wishful thinking and connecting patterns that are not there.\n\n>Satan fell before he tempted Adam and Eve in the Garden (Genesis 3:1-14).\n\nThe tempter in the Garden has always been referred to as a talking snake. The craftiest of God's creatures. The only connection has been when he is referred to as the old serpent in Revelations. The two are not connected any other way and the Jews, which included Jesus,  would have believed it to have been a snake. Which is why the snake was cursed to slither on its belly."

Please read more on the subject and stop reading Wendy Alec or other Hollywood inspired crypto theology. Read what the bible says, not what other people tell you it says. Satan isn't real. And if he was, he certainly isn't the devil you think he is. Mankind is evil enough without a boogeyman."

The fact that sin exists shows he atleast doesn't care or enjoys \"The Punishment\" because no login father would for 1 second want to see his child in agony or any kind. So god having \"Unlimited power\" couldn't eradicate sin😂😂😂😂😂\n\nGod like Clifford Devoe from Flash season 4, Highly intelligent being whose plan is so stupid people stopped watching the show😂😂😂😂\n\nMerciful and forgiving? Are you kidding me? If God was merciful he'd get rid of sin.\nLetting sin exist is a sign of sadist.\nDon't tell me Lucifer brought sin and shit, is your God powerful enough to eradicate sin? If he is and he hasn't eradicated it then he's evil, if he isn't then why bother praying to such a God."

All I gotta say is Jesus Christ fasho is a real person (A human, free will equipped). If the many motherfuckers of the Roman Empire, who’s uhh idk LIVING IN the time of Jesus.. were Questioning/Defying/Mocking/Torturing /etc. . After all the Gospel spread, many Miracles performed and even discarded all Temptation of SIN itself [against Satan himself & proved evil to be Inferior]. You on this app doing allat Hoo’Blah to my Lord doesn’t mean shit!! 😂😂 take it up with God and see for ya damn self KID 🤷‍♂️ or Dm for any Specific questions.. Honestly"

Obviously you've created him in your image so why not.\n4) Show me where in your Gospels is the Satan's whole story of bringing sin mentioned?\n5) You have never studied history for sure especially the history of your scriptures if you don't understand Satan is not even your Christian construct, it's a earlier version of pagan and Roman myth just used to make association of us vs them.\n6) Show me your God and I'll gladly take it up with him but until then his followers should be either responsible or shut up."
