Sudden trip to hospital\n2. Follow up with neuro testing that is used to assess cognitive ability in patients with recent neuro dysfunction.\n3. Signs of unilateral weakness, such as being unable to lift the cup of water.\n4. Face not moving symmetrically when he talks, which I thought was most obvious in the video posted before he went to the hospital.\n5. If you carefully watch the footage of him walking to Marine 1 from the house, he stumbled slightly twice, but this may be due to him being sick.\n6. He has high cholesterol which is major risk factor for having a stroke.\n\nSorry for the formatting/lack of sources, I am on mobile.  I'm sure there are many signs but these are only the ones I can think of now."

Well, you can cut the cough out, but because you’re using that single camera, there’s nothing else to work with—you cut the unsavory stuff & have a weird jump cut there. It doesn’t look natural. People will notice.\n\nBut say you’re also working with a second camera, rolling at the same time, but at a different angle. Trump coughs, but you can cut all that stuff out. You won’t get that “jump” cut, because it’s a second angle. Think of a movie when you’re watching a scene, and the editor cuts to multiples angles. They’re prob cutting out flubbed lines, or bloopers, etc. It makes it look fluid and the viewers never think about it."

    "text": "For those of us old enough to remember the Cold War, this is so reminiscent of Leonid Brezhnev. For several years there were rampant rumors that his health was anywhere from poor to abysmal, but he held on to power, all while his various successors spread rumors that his health was either great or horrible, depending on their particular goals. The Soviet Union was such a black box to most Americans that we literally had no idea who was in charge of the USSR for about the last four years of his presidency, including the Moscow Olympics, where of course a dictator was expected to play a prominent role.\n\nNobody knew who the leader of our greatest enemy was, whether he was really in charge, whether he was even capable of Performing the most basic of duties. This is such a Hallmark of authoritarian dictatorships. It is long past time for the 25th Amendment to have been involved and Pence absolutely needs to be put forth as the acting president.\n\nEdit: I hate my phone's voice to text. It randomly f****** capitalizes words that make no sense. It also won't let me cuss."

I have a decade experience in editing and dealing with poor footage, this was badly done.\n\nNow this is a terrible use of the morph feature because it's a not an easy thing to use to make seamless. One thing it can't do is morph out changes in appearance like that with the hair.\n\nCheck that little clip, you can see his hair change. With a bit more sticking up out of place."

My success rate with morph cut is probably like ~5% because if you don’t have consistent enough frames to morph both clips seamlessly, it can’t really morph at all. That looks like the case here. He was pretty much in the same place, but his little fingy was not."

In the high-quality (realDonaldTrump twitter) video, the color change across the edit is too subtle for the eye to notice.
