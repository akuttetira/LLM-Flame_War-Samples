You are awful and my pastor(s) and I have many times spoken out for the LGBT congregants at our church.\n\nA literal Master of Theology has spoken to me more about the Bible and it's contextual passages, the false justifications of some so-called Christians' bigotry, etc.\n\nJust fucking love people, and if you can't, shut your mouth."

And what did the proposal by \"Senator\" John Johnson say?\n\nit would be safe to assume that I don't consider his senatorship legitimate."
