    "text": "I'm not going to bother addressing every verse you brought up since most of it is just shotgun argumentation, but one thing did stick out, namely the summary that you put at the top of your post:\n\n>\nThe Bible presents magic and the acts of spirits and gods as real occurrences that should be detectable. I’ll ignore that miraculous events should be happening regularly.\n\nFirst and foremost these \"magical occurrences\" were not only detectable, but were recorded as history by people who claimed to witness them. People saw this stuff happen, and then wrote about it. The fact that they don't happen very much today (if at all) doesn't mean that they haven't ever happened before.\n\nThis is a common mistake that atheists make in a lot of their rhetoric, where they try to claim that just because something is statistically unlikely or hasn't happened in a long time, that must mean it's actually impossible for it to happen. It's pretty absurd, considering that unlikely events occur literally all of the time, such as your birth (as opposed to the millions of other sperm-cells that could have fertilized the egg that you came from), or the existence of a planet like Earth which has been so fine-tuned for life that it's probably alone in the Universe in that regard.\n\nThat leads me to the next thing. When you say things like \"miracles should be happening regularly\" it speaks volumes of what you actually know about the subject and how these terms are defined. A \"miracle\" (or magical occurrence, as you like to call it) is a departure from the laws of nature, or what is perceived to be \"normal\"; acted out by God for the purpose of displaying His power and authenticating the messages He gives to His prophets. Whenever a miracle is performed in the Bible it is always, without exception, to let everyone know that the miracle-worker came straight from God. Every single time. Because God's word is complete, and because we now have full access to everything God wants us to know in the Bible, there's no reason for God to perform miracles anymore.\n\nAlso like I said, miracles aren't *supposed* to be a common thing. The whole point to miracles is that they are rare, and in fact so rare that they basically never happen, meaning that when one does occur it must mean something special. If people were being brought back from the dead all the time, then Jesus' resurrection wouldn't mean anything. We're able to distinguish it as a miracle because it has never happened before."

And we know there are people who convincingly *pretend* to tell the future, heal people, transform objects, etc (palm readers, faith healers, stage magicians)."

There are people out there, especially ones of the sort of stripe I assume you are from, who could watch a miracle transpire right before their eyes and still find ways to dismiss it. I've talked with people who have said that they would probably assume that they were hallucinating if they saw something miraculous, and then turn around and demand even more proof from God. And when I entertain that idea and ask what further evidence they could want, it's always something completely ridiculous like \"He should sign every atom he used \" or \"He should do some celestial lightshows over my house and throw write \"I am GOD. I exist!\" on the moon\". And even that wouldn't fully persuade most of them.\n\nI don't want to make assumptions about you, but something tells me that you're no different than the rest of the hardcore atheists I've talked to. There's a point where you get so entrenched in what you believe (or don't believe I guess) that you quite literally cannot be reasoned with - no matter how much God reveals Himself to you or what He does to try to open your mind. The problem isn't that there's no proof, it's that even if it was sitting right in front of your face you would still keep denying it till the cows came home. That's a kind of spiritual blindness that an online debate just isn't going to fix.\n\nIf you can show that you are honestly considering these questions and aren't just karma-whoring to the pathetic excuse for an echo-chamber that this subreddit is, then we can carry this further. If not, then it'll have to be cut short."

I know plenty of Christians who would consider a miracle to be something like a child surviving cancer, or a car accident that should have resulted in death.  These things happen, yet they hold no proof of a god.  A miracle that proves a god would be someone like Jesus claiming to be god, and showing himself turning water into wine or walking on water before our eyes.  The fact that these types of specific miracles only happen in the specific religions holy text is suspicious to its credibility.\n\nWhy can’t god appear before my eyes in his own form (or a form that I could understand) and claim that he was the god who exists.  He is omnipotent, so he should be able to do so.  Is the human soul not worth his infinite time? Would he rather us be subject to his twisted test?  Why do Christians claim “you can’t test god”?  Who made that rule?  Sounds like it came about with Christianity as a way to dismiss the fact that we have 0 verifiable proof of the supernatural in regards to Christianity."

So why the disparity?\n\nThere are 83 miracles that are specified in the Old Testament, the Old Testament occurs over a period of 3600 years (from about 4000BC to 400BC). So we can conclude that miracles ought to happen around every 43 years or so based on that number. However, there are also 80 something miracles in the New Testament which takes place only over a period of a hundred years. Which would mean that miracles do not follow any predictable law and thus we cannot determine whether miracles exist based on whether they are occurring in any particular timeframe or not. Perhaps we have no major miracles for a couple hundred years and then in 2122 they just crop up all the time, we have no idea because there is no predictive power in regards to miracles.\n\nMy argument is that miracles can never be empirically verified because they do not conform to natural laws and empirical science is weak in that it can only investigate natural laws."

It’s a bit trickier to explain because of how you defined “magic”, however it works the same as the biblical perspective of “Light and darkness”. On one hand, you have the “good magic” produced by Yahweh to reveal himself to have a relationship *with* his creation, and on the other hand you have “bad magic” which is everything Yahweh *can* do, just without full completion or the power. One example you noted was the biblical Exodus account, where the Pharaoh’s magicians were able to make a staff into a snake, but when Moses did the *same*, ***His*** snake ate the other snakes.\n\nAnother example would be the specificity of “magical” judgments, such as the final plague on Egypt was the  death of the first born sons - just as Pharaoh had done to the Israelites."

Including a majority whom I haven’t spoken too in 5+ years that can still attest. This is why they are called Miracles, and not simply “good magic”.\n\n>So I have to believe it before I will see it? Why?

But as I said, that’s not really on topic.\n\nIt’s completely on topic from a Christian perspective. Creation is an act of intelligence. Doing something in the scale of the universe would require a incredibly more of a vastly intelligent being. I -*personally* - believe that science and Christianity co-exist, as science is based on the repeatability of tests. It’s a form of knowledge that describes the world we see and live. I believe you can only claim “God of the gaps” if the Bible said that creation wasn’t specific in design, and that’s not the case."

Certainly not every occurrence would be recorded on video but such dramatic change in people's lives would leave powerful memories and indicators."

I honestly feel bad for you if you honestly believe magic is real. Every example you’ve given so far does not prove magic. There’s no such things as demons,magic or god. You have to prove all those things without the use of the Bible. Also supernatural always turns out to be natural when investigated."

    "text": "No, every example I’ve given doesn’t meet ***your*** standard. That’s not my problem. You won’t understand it unless you are consistent in the worldview of *at least* a higher being.\n\nAs for cameras and recording, not really, no. God doesn’t work on the command of humans. It’s the other way around. Every miracle Yahweh has ever done has been for His own sake and fulfillment of His Will. A miracle is Gods evidence of existence, if you don’t believe in a God, you won’t understand the explanation.\n\nAs for the “supernatural always returning to the natural”: duh. You forget that the Bible is written by *human perspective*. Just because it doesn’t look natural at face value doesn’t mean it’s not being done by things in the earth. How else do you expect a god that claims to bring calamity? He works through the natural world to give evidence there is something above what we can see.\n\nFor example, if you take the biblical account of the Exodus, and you see how the pharaoh at the time killed first born sons. Through Egyptian history, thee is only a single account that can possibly match this, however it’s dated to about 100 years in the future from the exodus account.\n\nWho’s to say this is - in fact - the same time period and *humans* got it wrong? There’s more than enough information about the Pharaoh Ahmose and his firstborn son who died at a young age to draw a conclusion of how the events of the plagues happen."
