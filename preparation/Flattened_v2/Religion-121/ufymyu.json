    "text": ">For example in a marriage any time there is a disagreement the husband gets the final say.\n\nNo, that is just not how it works. I'm sorry if you're one of those people who was raised in a denomination constituting about 0.05% of the \"Christian\" population who practices patriarchal purity culture, but your average Christian married couple treats decisions the same as everybody else. I.e., when husband and wife disagree, the *wife* is always right.\n\n>Both religions say it’s sinful to turn down your partner for sex. Now I know this flows both ways, but with men on average having much higher sex drives it obviously is to the male’s advantage.\n\nSlightly... maybe? Assuming that's an \"advantage\" as the word typically connotates.\n\n[https://www.bustle.com/articles/109705-women-want-sex-just-as-much-as-men-do-new-survey-shows-and-more-things-to#:\\~:text=Over%20Half%20Of%20Women%20Want%20More%20Sex&text=Of%20those%20surveyed%2C%2053.2%20percent,having%20their%20sexual%20desires%20fulfilled](https://www.bustle.com/articles/109705-women-want-sex-just-as-much-as-men-do-new-survey-shows-and-more-things-to#:~:text=Over%20Half%20Of%20Women%20Want%20More%20Sex&text=Of%20those%20surveyed%2C%2053.2%20percent,having%20their%20sexual%20desires%20fulfilled).\n\nTo summarize, half of women want the frequency of their sex to be greater. So again, even if having lots of sex is some sort of a competitive advantage, it's one that ***plenty*** of women should utilize, too.\n\n>you might emphasize the obligations of husbands, but a sex slave that is treated better than most sex slaves is still a sex slave.\n\nFirstly, they're both sex-slaves, as you've already pointed out.\n\nSecondly, please do not compare married adult women who would have no relationship other than their present one to kidnaped children who're sold and raped on the daily in third world countries, people who are *actual* sex slaves.\n\nSpeaking of, let's check out these obligations of husbands. This is from Ephesians 5:\n\n>Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself for it, that He might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, and that He might present to Himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish. In this way men ought to love their wives as their own bodies.\n\nThe word \"love\" here, in the original Greek, is *agape*. The Greeks had numerous words for *love*, and *agape* means *sacrificial* love, as this passage indicates. Paul says to love your wives like Jesus loves us, and Jesus loves us enough to die for us.\n\nHere's what that looks like: my father, who has no interest whatsoever in anything to do with horses, which he shouldn't because horses are a terrible investment that turn beautiful land into stinky mudholes, for the sake of my country, horse-loving mother, dedicated half of our property into a pasture for the horses, built all one-thousand feet of the fence to enclose it, and build *two* barns. When she wanted a new kitchen table but didn't want to pay for a new one, my father built one for her (I had to help, and trust me, if you haven't build one then you don't understand the difficulty of the task). When she wants new shelves, he builds them. When she wants a room painted, he paints it.\n\n\"bUt SeX sLaV-\" I'm sorry, but who looks like they're getting more out of this relationship? Is my mother an oppressed sex slave who has no autonomy and no means of disseminating her desires unless it's something that my father would also enjoy?\n\n>The most fair solution I can think of is either close monitoring of all religious households to make sure daughters are always aware of all their options and potential removal from the home always being on the table, or making it illegal to teach children about religion.\n\nThis is why America exists to begin with. People fled from England to live in absence of a government controlling them on the basis of religious beliefs that the government didn't approve of. What do you think the gun-totting right is going to do if our government starts to discriminate against Christians? Even the non-Christian ones are going to go up in arms.\n\n>I realize neither of these solutions are feasible or likely, but I don’t see any other way for women and girls to be protected in these cultures.\n\nThey do not need protection from religion. They aren't attacked or oppressed by religion. Not even the typical Muslim marriage in America resembles anything in the ball park of your nonsensical fear-mongering.\n\nIts this kind of propaganda that makes me worried from the future. What if someone like you gets enough power to start discriminating against religious people, regulating their households and raising their kids for them. I guess you're one of those who thinks that Florida schools should be able to take the place of Floridian parents, even though the bill preventing this is based on a school abusing a child with gender ideology to the point that she tried to commit suicide multiple times on the school's grounds before they contacted her parents about her gender confusion?\n\nThe fact that this sort of bigoted dictatorial Orwellian nonsense is propagated should alarm anybody with more braincells than Biden has years left to live and is why we cling to our guns. Thank goodness my sisters and I were InDoCrInAtEd into proficient firearms use."

Your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you.” - Genesis 3:16\n\n.\n\n>Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit in everything to their husbands. - Ephesians 5:22-24\n\n.\n\n>Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. - Colossians 3:18\n\n.\n\n>Likewise, wives, be subject to your own husbands, so that even if some do not obey the word, they may be won without a word by the conduct of their wives, -1 Peter 3:1\n\n.\n\n>Let a woman learn quietly with all submissiveness. I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet. For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor. Yet she will be saved through childbearing—if they continue in faith and love and holiness, with self-control. 1 Timothy 2:11-15\n\n.\n\n>But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a wife is her husband, and the head of Christ is God. 1 Corinthians 11:3\n\n.\n\n>The women should keep silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be in submission, as the Law also says. If there is anything they desire to learn, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church. 1 Corinthians 14:34-35\n\n."

    "text": "Most of the Christian marriages I know of, including my own before I left the faith,  are very patriarchal.  Women may be treated slightly better than in Bible times, but geez, look how long it took for women to get the right to vote!! This was based on the interpretation of Judeo Christian beliefs.  There is the passage you quoted about men being expected to love their wives, but there are plenty more verses that talk about women being considered property, and that they basically need to not be annoying and that they are never to teach men.  Side note, Jesus loves you so much he’ll burn you in hell for eternity if you don’t acknowledge him."

The fact is that most Christian women aren't treated any differently than the average American woman.\n\n> Women may be treated slightly better\n\nSlightly? The Israelites instituted the death penalty for rape. That was completely unheard of. The Israelites were allowed to take female slaves partially because they had nowhere else to go when the Israelites conquered their nation. In being Israelite slaves, these women had lots of, again, ***unheard of*** rights that made even wealthy women of pagan nations look like pigs trampled under foot. For example, if they left their dwelling, Israelites were banned from returning them and were required to house them unless they chose another location of refuge.\n\nIsraelites were allowed to make wives out of the women of conquered people. This was another form of protection for them, as back then, women had no means of economically sustaining themselves. A widowed woman with no sons was completely destitute and devoid of any societal benefit outside of begging for spare change.\n\n\"SlIgHtLy\" my ass.\n\n>There is the passage you quoted about men being expected to love their wives, but there are plenty more verses that talk about women being considered property, and that they basically need to not be annoying and that they are never to teach men.\n\nYou mean the ones of which you're ignoring historical context?\n\n>Side note, Jesus loves you so much he’ll burn you in hell for eternity if you don’t acknowledge him.\n\nAre you trying to argue in bad faith?\n\nAlso, you misspelled, \"He died the most painful death humanly possible for you.\""

Jesus is god according to Christians, which means he/ god will send you to hell for not acknowledging him regardless of the fact that there’s no reason to believe any of it is true. I  don’t mind debating, but chill.  Women should have never been treated poorly in the first place. You can keep trying to justify all the atrocities in the Bible and the way women were mistreated, but the fact is, if those things( slavery, misogyny, etc)  weren’t in the Bible, perhaps the “Christians” in the USA wouldn’t have thought they were a good idea to implement . Let’s not forget all the genocide god ordered and the permission to take women( only virgins of course) as wives( sex slaves). This was what your god wanted. You would think an all knowing, all powerful god would condemn slavery, rape and misogyny outright- but nope. I don’t believe in your version of god. That is not a good father or a good god."

I think my father's properly interpreting that passage.\n\n>The man has the final say.

You are supposed to love your wife so much that you will undergo significant sacrifices for her, crucifixion-like sacrifices if necessary. No, we're not \"in charge,\" of our wives as if they were a hired housemaid or our children.\n\nAgain, mother wants a square acre of fence and two barns for horses?
