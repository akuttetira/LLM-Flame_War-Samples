    "text": "I would just add that circumcision does have negative consequences. The foreskin  acts as a lubricant for the frenulum. Without it, sex and masturbation can be painful and the head of the penis becomes desensitized over time, causing difficulty orgasming. It replaces some of the most sensitive and flexible tissue with scar tissue. Not to mention the cases where the procedure is done poorly and severely damages sensitivity.\n\nBut since most circumcised men don’t know what a natural penis should feel like, they don’t necessarily realize that they could have a more sensitive and healthier penis with a foreskin.\n\nIt’s ironic that the very religions that forbid tattoos, piercings, or any cosmetic body modifications in the name of naturalism are the ones who mutilate their sons at birth. It undermines their entire stance on the sanctity of the body."

    "text": "The science is well documented. The foreskin contains the most sensitive skin. Cutting off any skin anywhere reduces sensitivity by replacing nerves with scar tissue. Scar tissue is less flexible and hurts to be stretched. The foreskin normally acts as a lubricating sleeve around the penis during intercourse. Without it, there is more friction between both partners genitals, reducing pleasure and increasing pain. The foreskin is otherwise meant to shield the tip of the penis from excessive contact so without it, they’re rubbing against clothing all day which also wears down sensitivity.\n\nAnd isn’t that the intent of circumcision, to reduce sexual pleasure?\n\nAs for me personally, I have dealt with problems because of being circumcised, namely difficulty orgasming during intercourse. My cousin was circumcised at 16 and has had nothing but problems since then. He knows very well what he’s lost. Of course, even at 16 he was forced by his parents."

I dare say that if a Jewish man was deemed not to be Jewish if he was uncircumcised then it means his Jewish peers had rejected him. Heaps of non-Jewish people get circumcised. The OP isn’t even arguing against circumcision. They’re arguing that circumcising babies is bad. How can a baby be Jewish or any other religion? If you argue that if the baby is born to Jewish parents it’s a Jewish baby then isn’t the baby already Jewish ethnically, religiously or both from birth even if they’re not circumcised. Thank goodness Jewish girls don’t get circumcised like they do to girls in many other cultures/religions. I’m sure that those performing female circumcision would believe in their tradition too. They would feel like they’re doing the right thing because it’s dictated by religion and culture. Does that make it right or even healthy? Surely there exist more advanced and nuanced ways for Jewish men to belong to the group without the need for foreskin removal these days? Is an ex-Jewish man still a Jew because he was circumcised at birth? Does a non-Jew belong to the fold if he was circumcised as a baby or as an adult when he was able to consent to the procedure? What do you think about religions that practice female circumcision? Why is that any different if it too is a cultural tradition and it happens to all the females when they are the right age without their consent? Can you not have an opinion on other cultural practices that might be unsafe or cause actual harm but have no health benefits because you are Jewish and only non-Jewish religions practice female circumcision? Culture, religion and tradition do not make any practice right or even healthy. Culture, religion and traditions change and can be changed. Are there any ancient practises within Judaism that no longer are practiced? Are there any relatively new Jewish practices/traditions that ancient Jews did not practice? How do things evolve within an ancient religion or culture? Is change ok so long as the main rules are adhered to and there is a believe or worship of god? Many people throughout history have used religion to justify treating other humans repulsively, but that doesn’t make it ok, does it? Whether the rule is the first or the last, it doesn’t make it more or less important, especially when every culture has hundreds of rules and traditions - and even when we are talking about Judaism or Christianity or Islam or Buddhism, etc, we’re not really talking about one religion are we? Are there not many sects of Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, etc? Do they differ on key points? On which key points must they still agree to be considered Christian or Jewish?\n\nAll opinions are relevant. Your Jewish brother in this thread had an opinion that differed to yours. Is his opinion not just as important as yours? He puts himself out there and fights against the anti-semites. He has the right and immense courage to question traditions even when his faith and heritage is important to him. You make him seem like he’s naive and has a foot in Judaism and another foot in the world of gentiles and that eventually the gentiles will turn on him. You are turning on him by suggesting he doesn’t realise his fate is to be eaten by the wolves of the world (non-Jews). Abuse and persecution aren’t inevitabilities. I defend anyone’s right to do whatever they want with their life whether they are religious or not, so long as they aren’t hurting themselves or anyone else, especially children. No matter our religion or lack thereof, we should all care about protecting children. It’s our duty as adults whether the child is mine or not is never the point. Being a bystander to cruelty is not ok. It’s healthy to question our beliefs. It doesn’t mean you have to abandon them even if someone decides to be obedient for the sake of obedience or because tradition and culture are important to them. Faith and lack of faith are very individual. It’s ok for Jewish people to love their religion and defend all of it or most of it (ie except for a tradition they find abhorrent). Many religions don’t encourage questioning their beliefs or traditions because they know they don’t have all the answers and they’d lose adherents if they encouraged open questioning. Blind faith has the power to make a good person so bad things. Questions are important. Human rights are important. As is logic and reason"

    "text": "This is what Maimonides (a Rabbi from the XII century) has to say has to say about it:\n\n“Similarly with regard to circumcision, one of the reasons for it is, in my opinion, the wish to bring about a decrease in sexual intercourse and a weakening of the organ in question, so that this activity be diminished and the organ be in as quiet a state as possible. It has been thought that circumcision perfects what is defective congenitally. This gave the possibility to everyone to raise an objection and to say: How can natural things be defective so that they need to be perfected from outside, all the more because we know how useful the foreskin is for that member? In fact this commandment has not been prescribed with a view to perfecting what is defective congenitally, but to perfecting what is defective morally. The bodily pain caused to that member is the real purpose of circumcision. None of the activities necessary for the preservation of the individual is harmed thereby, nor is procreation rendered impossible, but violent concupiscence and lust that goes beyond what is needed are diminished. The fact that circumcision weakens the faculty of sexual excitement and sometimes perhaps diminishes the pleasure is indubitable.
