Being a hateful, wretched old sack is his schtick, and he plays his part well.\n\nI'd say Biden should know better (and no, I'm not \"both sides\"-ing here- instead I'm saying while it's a low, low bar, the DNC and what passes for the American \"left\" at least has some standards).\n\nRudy has no reason to do better, and he knows it. His president/client's schtick is \"grab her by the pussy\" and lusting after his daughter. His party happily platforms zealots looking to recreate the Handmaid's Tale, avowed racists and bigots of all kinds, and literal pedophiles. Why would he do better?

I even kind of buy that he was tucking his shirt in. She HAD just removed his microphone and done something to his shirt. It’s far easier to tuck back in laying down if you have a gut.\n\nI’m no fan of the man, but apart from her being younger I don’t see any huge sexual misconduct. The actress is of age, and as far as I could tell, he was never told otherwise. She was fawning over him. Takes a much better man than he is to not react to that.

They preach politics at the alter and promote bigotry. Churches should pay taxes if they have the balls to ask for FEDERAL AND STATE aid. It's bad enough you utilize land and services that you pay almost nothing for. Mormon church and Catholic church are the perfect examples of corruption."

They've done this for thousands of years - they know the way to more money. They're not stupid in that aspect.\n\nIs it really charity if conversion and more income is the endgame? Doesn't seem very altruistic to me.\n\nIf you want your tax dollars to go to feeding people, maybe it's time to start writing your local representatives and push to increase funding for shelters and food banks?

I've heard church leaders encouraging parishioners to donate more... More than they can afford because God will make sure their needs are met but the church needs money NOW. The greed and hypocrisy is amazing.\n\nI am jaded, yes. Churches are an abomination as far as community goes. Their purposes for the community could easily be met with a secular community center where everyone is welcome and no one has to deal with \"a few churchy things and maybe a prayer.\" No one should have religion forced on them.
