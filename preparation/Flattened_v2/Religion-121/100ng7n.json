Xd i'm not ahtiest i swear to god (not allah tho xD )\n\n\nyou are right it was normal for young girls to marry at a young age but 1 they didnt marry 50 yo and 2 they were not prophets from god they were normal  ignorant  people and as soon as they learned that it's wrong and that little girls were hurt both physcially and psychologically thety banned the practice\n\nagain if us or any other country does something wrong it doesnt become a justification for u to do likewise\n\n\ni'm indeed an emotional creature , so are all humans\n\nthe proof of what i'm saying is you defending whole heartedly a god and a man you have never seen , talked to , or even had a proof of their existence except that your parents told u that and their parents told them that etc"

We think that girls married younger back then but they didn’t.  The only times girls were married off at young ages were 99% of the time for political reasons and most people absolutely thought it was weird to marry off young girls to old men.   When people did marry young they typically married other young people."
