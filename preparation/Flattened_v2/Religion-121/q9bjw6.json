The parables of the wheat and weeds (gods people were the wheat and the devil's people were the weeds. Wheat (god's) and chaff (satan's) the Sheep(God's ) and the goats (satan's)\n\nare all parables jesus taught that show this life was given to us for the purpose of separating the undesirable people from those who elect to follow Christ.\n\n**I am glad there are so few people in the world like you**\n\nIt's not how you perceive judgement here by others that is important. Be concerned in how God see and judges."

IE if a subject matter is unfalsifiable it means science is not equipped to study the subject.\n\n2) you do understand there are other academic pursuits outside of science right?\n\nfor instance i could make a philosophical argument, or i could make a cosmological argument or a theological argument or even a mathematical (well i couldn't but i've seen it done. Heck i could even make a case based on the same proof standards required in a court of law.\n\nto say no valid argument can be made is to hide (you are hiding)/trying to avoid an discussion you are not equipped to have.\n\nTo which why are you on reddit if you do not want to/cant discuss these things?\n\n**Your prophet is a long-dead con man.**\n\nI not muslim... so i don't have a prophet.\n\n**I'm not going to sit here and pretend your beliefs are okay or acceptable. They are disgusting and awful and you should be ashamed. I do not wish to entertain what you have to say as in any way valid when it isn't.**\n\ni dont care. i am here to have a discussion if you do not want one then simply ignore my post."
