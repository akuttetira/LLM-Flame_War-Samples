For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother in law and a man’s foes will be those of his own household. He who loves mother or father more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me; and he who does not take his cross to follow me is not worthy of me. He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for my sake will find it.*\" - Jesus (Matthew 10:34-37)\n\n\n**Jesus told a man to not worry about taking time to burry his dead father, just follow him instead:**\n\n\n> \"*And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.

It was only when she said like a slave, that even the dogs eat crumbs that fall from the master's table, that he was willing to help her:**\n\n\n> \"*But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me. But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs. And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table. Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.*\" - Matthew 15:24-28"

    "text": "He doesnt fit that description because you just pointed out love and completely ignored everything else i just wrote. why do you insist in your mind, that love is the only thing God is? or can be. Like do you think a perfect person would be all laughs and niceness? Must be a cramped space your mind is in.\n\nI see what you wrote, and its all twisted and misinterpreted. Ive said this before, and ill say it now, A lot of atheists claim to have critical thinking skills, and that theyre above religion because of it but you guys astonish me every single post by showing a huge lack of those critical thinking skills. Just as you have done here yet again,. Do i really have to sit here and explain something you will just forget and continue to regurgitate that false narrative?\n\nGod set rules on us humans because without these rules or morals we would be murdering each other, warring constantly with bigger catastrophes and doing so much more damage than is being done. That is the human way, Slavery exists BECAUSE of humans, God let it be because regardless of what he said, we would have our own way.\n\nJesus was sent for the israelites because they are the chosen people. Does that offend you? guess what, they were the only ones who honored God and did his will while the other civiliations turned him away when he came offering himself.\n\nJesus talks about that woman maybe to test her faith, or test his diciples. but to you, thats racists. Lack of critical thinking skills here.\n\nGod and Christ talking about slavery. Must be racists says the 21st century modern man who is just following what the crowd says now. Maybe in 10 years slavery will be ok and there willl be another like you saying \"well why is there slavery now, i thought God was love\". And no im not pro slavery, i am just using the same set of thinking skills you seem to be using. What is your definition of a perfect society, no wars? no slavery? everyones rich and happy? Thats exactly what your perception is of this world. But someone else it is different, to them it could be slavery and that only certain people are wealthy and happy, to them that is their perfection. Whos right here?\n\nHate your father and follow me? Once again, a lack of critial thinking skills. \"Love God above all else\". You must be able to let go of worldly desires and possessions before you can follow God. Guess what, only a very very few amount of people are doing that nowadays. People love status, money, women/men, sin in general. But to you, you only see hate and immediately scream \"JESUS SAID TO HATE, I GOT YOU CHRISTIANS\". Pretty ridiculous man.\n\nYes, cut off the foot if it makes you sin, is it bad to remove what can take your salvation? Does that offend you so much? Noones telling you to do it, just do as you please man, its your choice, your life, your eternity.\n\nalso, why are you so bothered about the everlasting fires of hell? you dont believe in it after all, to me, you have given yourself to the world and are now a part of it, furthest from God, all because you let your logic and wanting to fit in with the world take over. Youve let your social status and friends dictate your life and now that is who you are.\n\nAlso, cutting off your foot doesnt mean the actual foot or hand, but it also does mean it. It could mean ANY thing that makes you sin, cut it off, get rid of it."

Either that is true or it isn't. Meanwhile the biblical god does not fit the biblical description of love in 1 Corinthians 13:4-7.\n\n> \"*Hate your father and follow me? Once again, a lack of critial thinking skills. \"Love God above all else\".*\"\n\n\nNo it isn't a lack of critical thinking skills. The actual text says that \"Brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child, and the **children should rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death**.\" (Matthew 10:21) and that \"**a man’s foes will be those of his own household.**\" (Matthew 10:34-37).\n\n\nThe text says what it says. It's not just saying to love the biblical god more than others but to also actually hate family members and even send them to death.\n\n\n> \"*you have given yourself to the world and are now a part of it, furthest from God, all because you let your logic and wanting to fit in with the world take over.*\"\n\n\nActually, in The US, there are christian extremists trying to force their religious views on everyone and take away freedom of speech and freedom of religion beased on their own religious views. They want to control other people's bodies and suppress other people that they disagree with, despite the 1st Amendament which says that \"*Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;...*\". Christians want to try to win over the Senate and House and Presidency in order to force christian nationalism through the republican party.\n\n\nIronically, if christians win then it'll be another sign that their religion is false since the bible says that the world should be getting less and less christian until it becomes so unchristian that Jesus to judge the world returns according to the book of revelation, not a christian take over before then."

    "text": "The problem is that you're saying God is loving, God is moral, etc, and yet when anyone tries to apply even a very loose definition, God doesn't fit. Even applying the Bible's *own* definition of love, God doesn't fit:\n\n1 Corinthians 13:4-7: \"Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.\"\n\nPatient? Certainly not - take the story of the golden calf, for example, where Moses comes down from the mountain with the tablets, God sees the golden calf, his immediate reaction to them having broken a rule *he hadn't even given them yet* is to have 3,000 of them slaughtered.\n\nGod is also jealous - Exodus says his very name is jealous.\n\nKeeps no record of wrongs? Well that's not true right from the start to the end.\n\nGod is described as avenging and wrathful, not exactly the pinnacle of kindness.\n\nAlways protects? On numerous occasions God removes his protection from some group or person he liked before because they did something he didn't like. (The golden calf is again such an example).\n\nAlways perseveres? Well God basically gave up early on in Genesis and decided to flood the world and reset everything. That's not persevering, that's erasing everything and starting again.\n\nSo not only does God not match any definitions in common usage, but he also doesn't match the definition *the Bible itself gives*.\n\n(Also you can't make a circle out of Bezier curves; and before I had been more specific in saying right angles, I just wasn't bothered to type it out again to make the same point)"
