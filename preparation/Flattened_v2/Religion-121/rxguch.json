    "text": "> Basically, god has the same psychological makeup as we do and can get caught up in emotion which leads them to kind of forget that they have omniscience\n\nIt seems like there's a contradiction there. Forget would mean to, at least temporarily, lose knowledge. Something forgetting thus couldn't be omniscient. If God doesn't know, even for a fleeting moment he's omniscient, then for that fleeting moment at least, he's not omniscient.\n\n>In the primordial existence before material creation, good and evil existed in the proper balance and existence was at peace.\n\nHow do concepts of good and evil, which by all appearances seem to be relative and applicable only to sentients, exist in primordial chaos?"

    "text": "> Well, to start, I think our concepts of possibility don’t really apply to the non-material, if they even apply to the physical world which, really, they may not.\n\nSure they can, unless you can present a reason why not. A contradiction is unavoidably untrue, and a forgetful omniscient being is such a contradiction. I'm not sure what philosophical rabbit holes you're diving into, but that much is unavoidable.\n\n>Either way, I would say that the Divine is not bound by contradiction and paradox. God can, in the old example, both be able to create a rock too heavy to lift and also lift it.\n\nSimultaneously, no, and most credible opinions on the matter don't ascribe him such power. See Aquinas for example. God could create an object too heavy to lift, and subsequently increase his strength to lift it.\n\nAs for a forgetful omniscient being, in no way can you explain how such directly opposing facts can simultaneously exist, and to say something to the effect of \"we can't understand it, but know it does\" is itself illogical, because you can't possibly know that about something you understand nothing about. It's an escape hatch argument meant to avoid admitting it's wrong to think this contradiction could be real.\n\n>To our minds, yeah, that’s contradictory, but the Divine can have simultaneously true contradictions. Of course, if you don’t agree with this, then obviously that’s an irreconcilable point here.\n\nIt's perfectly reconcilable. You just need to rethink your position on it.\n\n>As for the good and evil part, I don’t really think the primordial was chaos but, maybe more importantly, in a sort of Kabbalistic sense, I only use good and evil as sort of metaphorical terms to express forces. By “good,” I don’t mean helping a stranger down on their luck; I mean an indescribable force that we can recognize but not define. The same is the case with evil.\n\nSo you're saying there were two opposing \"forces\" which you pretty much cannot describe, know nothing about, and have no obvious meaning?\n\n>Be, really, I don’t think perfection exists materially or in the Divine. I think the nature of existence is imperfection, and, thus, in a manner of speaking, imperfection is perfection\n\nImperfection is perfection, night is day, everything is everything. This doesn't actually mean anything.\n\n>I think we get too caught up in the idea that the Divine would be perfect, and I’d challenge us to ask what perfection even is. I think we long too strongly for something without complexity and flaws\n\nBy definition, that is perfection.\n\n>We even reject ourselves for failing to be “perfect.”\n\n>and perfection as we’ve known it is just an idea we came up with long ago and got ourselves thoroughly obsessed with\n\nIt is a concept, either concrete or abstract. How this is germane to anything I said is beyond me at this point and can't help but wonder how you wandered so far off the reservation.\n\nI, as do many, don't do so, as coming to terms with the fact perfection is unattainable isn't that difficult. Possibly not even desirable.\n\n>So, in that, an imperfect creation by an imperfect creator has no issue with the perfection argument.\n\nThe perfection argument that the creator is perfect? An imperfect creator clearly has a problem where that argument is concerned, if that's the argument you're making but I can't really tell because you're all over the place and, no offense, but a lot of what you're saying seems like gobbledygook.\n\n>That said, I’m not a Christian (or member of any organized faith) and do believe that the Bible is truly awful in what it describes, and I feel the same way about the arguments that suffering is a “test.”\n\nYou do seem like a solipsist, one so willing to do away with meaning as to all but say it never really exists, which is an indefensible position. I'm not a Christian either, or theist of any kind, but as far as what we're talking about is concerned, that doesn't matter. You don't need to mention that if you're concerned about being viewed as biased."

I’m not a solipsist; I’m more of a theistic humanist, and I take a lot of inspiration from different schools of thought (e.g. I take from Derrida and deconstruction in my belief against objectivity and “Truth”). Really, my only core beliefs are in human dignity. Everything else I keep open to possibility."

    "text": "I'm not gonna go down this point by point, since none of it pertains to the discussion, which is about the obvious contradiction of an a forgetful, omniscient got.\n\nFacts matter in concerns that are a matter of fact, feelings matter in concerns that are matters of feeling. Someone can feel all you want that the earth is flat, and if they do, they're buffoons. No amount of irrelevant metaphors about everyday minutae like sandwiches is going to make that any less so. There's an objective reality, and it's not subject to your perspective, or anyone else's for that matter.\n\nYou know why you need to apologize to your hypothetical girlfriend? Because it's social convention to say goodbye to a loved one or friend when leaving their proximity Failure to do so makes the offender an inconsiderate dick, as a matter of fact.\n\nDon't waste my time with this solipsism (which this undeniably is). It's rubbish really. \"Everything is everything\" is the most accurate and succinct way to describe what you're saying, which is directly in conflict with reality and makes meaning so nebulous as to be functionally nonexistent. You're so over the place your responses can best be described as schizophrenic.\n\n>The facts don’t really matter; the feelings do, just like the feelings were what caused the sense of hurt, not the facts\n\nThis is one of the unhinged responses I've ever heard. Since I feel that way, that's all the matters, according to you at least.\n\nYou still have yet to explain how an all-knowing being can not know something other than a lazy copout incurring another contradiction (I know something I don't) other than with outrageous and irrelevant tangents meant to distract from the one thing you do seem to know, that clearly your initial contention was mistaken.\n\nThese diatribes of yours are really just mental masturbation. They describe nothing of value, demonstrate nothing, and have nothing to do with the topic at hand. A reductio ad absurdum makes them easy to dispute. If what you said was true, truth would be malleable to the point you can't confidently know or say your view is true, which incurs yet another contradiction and would in fact make ascribing falsity to it all too easy, resulting in you being wrong."
