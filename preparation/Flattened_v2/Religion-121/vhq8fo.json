Also he condemned them for creating hell on earth for others so their agony is justified. Plus his threat of hell was just angry hyperbole. It was allegorical, as is obvious from the context.\n\nPlus their weeping and gnashing is only because they're stuck with other assholes. They have only themselves to blame.\n\nIf I am invited to paradise I will gladly go and then try to help other people get in. If they cruelly and persistently reject my help then I honestly won't feel too bad."

Remember also the rich man in the Lazarus story who was kept in flames and denied water. Surely that condition contributes something to the gnashing."
