We all have a sense of right and wrong. Atheists just realize that they are the ones who determine what it is, while theists assume it comes from an immaterial spirit. Either way, good people are good and bad people are bad, regardless of what our theistic position may be."

I haven't the time nor the the expertise.. and also everytime I try to set up the expirement something _interferes_.... basically I just go off what I deem to be the consensus of those in the field--for all I know these scientists could spend their days snorting cocaine while bouncing ideas off of each other as to what crazy shit they are gonna \"discover\" next.  You really have no way of knowing anything for certain.   It shouldn't come as any surprise that people can \"feel God's presence\".  I mean, first of all he could exist and just be sitting their fondling the person--and if he doesn't or he's not, imagine every authority figure in your life telling you there's a guy named Greg who watches you through the shower faucet.

Abraham *did not want* to kill Isaac, down to his very core, but God demanded it, to compel obedience, and then stayed Abraham's hand before he could follow through, demonstrating that through loyalty to him, one will be rewarded so long as one obeys.\n\nNow of course I don't believe in the veracity of the mythos, but it is an interesting contrast to how so many people who consider themselves \"religious\" today transparently use god to justify anything they already want to do."

I.e. your social group is religious but you and they are also subject to the greater pressure of society that says hey lgbtq are just fine.\n\nSo you have to walk the line with both social groups that you are dependent on.\n\nNow if a person occupying a world position starts empowering the voices of those who still want to discriminate against people (cause, hey, other people I don't know are scary y'all!) Then that basically reduces the greater social pressure to be publicly 'ok with the gay\"(or any other 'other' you and your social group don't like/trust etc.)\n\nTribalism and xenophobia has deep roots in social biological evolution and it takes efforts to overcome the negative repercussions in a more global and diverse world.\n\nI'm simplifying here. There are decent people trapped in the dogma of their social groups and expressing a different opinion than your social group is very risky to your well being, regardless.\n\nBreaking away from your friends family and risking work etc takes a lot more than people probably realize.\n\nThis is obviously why few politicians come out as secular."

My mother and father were best friends with the pastor and his wife. At 14 I had been going to this church my whole life. All of a sudden they claimed my mom stole money. (She did the accounting). It threw my parents into a loop. Forgiveness was a major thing in that church. And their best friends of 20 years all of a sudden cast them out.\nMy parents hated lgbtq relationships, they hated witchcraft and so on. I wasn't allowed Halloween as a kid. These ideals didn't leave an impression on my siblings and I. Because we didn't get why any of this stuff was bad. It's been 14 years since they were kicked out of the church. And they now accept anyone of any sexuality. They celebrate Halloween. Heck mom even says she likes Harry Potter, which we burned out back behind the church. And now we can enjoy an adult beverage together. She still has her faith. But honestly I think she's lost alot of her fanatical zeal. She sees that she hasn't been punished for being more open and accepting. She knows she's still a good human.\nWho would have known what getting booted from her church would have done for her?"

    "text": "There are several neuroscience studies that show what parts of the brain light up when someone talks about their god.\n\nIn one, people were asked to describe their \"relationship\" with their god, while speaking the part of the brain that deals with thinking of other people lit up.\n\nIn a separate study, when asked the opinions others a part of the brain lit up. When asked about their own opinion a different part lit up. When asked about their deity's opinion the same part of the brain that deals with personal opinion lit up. When given a refutation of their opinion from the holy text they were skeptical and refused to consider changing their mind because \"God speaks to them\" and tells them which parts to believe.\n\nBasically, while theists think of their god as a separate entity, their deity's opinions always happen to match theirs. This is yet another danger of religion as it trains people to be unwilling to change their mind to reflect reality. Now I'm just waiting for a study that looks at the same parts of the brain regarding imaginary friends."

Frankly, these people frighten me. Politics and governing demand compromise. But these Christians believe they are acting in the name of God, so they can't and won't compromise. I know, I've tried to deal with them.”\n\n― Barry Goldwater"
