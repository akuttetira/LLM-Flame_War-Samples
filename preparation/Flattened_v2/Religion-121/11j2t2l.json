(No offense, just speaking from experience.)\n\n>The fact that you are alive right now is proof that God acknowledges your existence.\n\nNo, the fact that I'm alive is only proof that I am alive. In order to connect my existence to the existence of a \"God\", you would first need evidence that actually connects the two ideas. (And even more evidence to connect me to a \"God\" who acknowledges me in some way.)\n\n>And if you make an attempt to communicate with God through prayer, then he will be there. You might not see it or feel it, but he is there.\n\n\"He will be there\" how? As I said, I have tried. For years and years, I tried my absolute best to communicate with \"God\". Any \"God\", not just the Christian one, as a way to cover all the bases.\n\nAnd nothing happened. I never once noticed any discernable change or feeling or \"presence\". All I ever felt, through all those efforts, was increasingly empty and let down.\n\n>God knows all of your attempts, and he is proud for what you've done.\n\nThen he knows where I live and how to contact me. If he can't be bothered, after all my genuine attempts, then I see no reason to trust that he exists. And just as importantly, I see no reason to believe that he is worthy of my trust, even if he did exist.\n\n>Why do you think that God does not respond to you?\n\nAs stated in the OP, I suspect that it is simply because there never was any sort of \"God\" involved in any of this. It has only ever been humans, and we are on our own here.\n\nThat might sound bleak to you, but that's the \"inconvenient truth\", as far as I can tell."

I myself do not actually know these things about you, and how can I?\nBut I had this feeling of happiness inside that wasn't from me while typing that comment, and I felt compelled to tell you that God is proud of what you've done.\nNow let's say that the existence of God cannot be proven nor disproven, so for argument sake let's just say that God is 100% real.\n(Even though I already do believe this.)\nThe fact that you are alive right now is proof that God acknowledges your existence because if God didn't acknowledge you, then you would be dead.\nWhen you pray to God he is there in spirit. He hears and sees your every prayer.\nThe fact that you prayed to numerous God's means that you have a lack of belief in faith and in God, and knowing this God might not have responded to you because he knew that your heart and being wasn't 100% into it.\nI know the feeling of discouragement and feeling let down after praying, but this is because we build up an expectation of what We want from God instead of letting God give us what he has to offer.\nNow does this mean that God will answer us all the time every time after prayer? Probably not, but I would rather pray and feel nothing than to not pray at all. Because I know that human emotions can manipulate our thoughts, and that the devil knows how to use this to trick us.\nSo just because you felt emptiness doesn't mean that God wasn't listening.\nAnd I'm sorry to say but it's not God's job to come and find you.\nNow although God will and has done this for certain people throughout history it is still our job for us to chase him based on our love for him\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry that your experiences with God weren't all that you were hoping for, but I had been in your shoes for a while as well when I first started praying.\n\nI didn't feel, see, or hear anything, so what was the point, right?\n\nBut overtime I learned that just because I didn't feel any change didn't mean that God wasn't making any for me.\n\nNow I don't agree with your opinion that it has only ever been humans, and that we are on our own, but I respect the fact that you have one, and can see how you came up with that conclusion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow before I end this message I would just like to ask for your blessing to pray for you.

    "text": "I appreciate the heart-felt response.\n\n>The fact that you prayed to numerous God's means that you have a lack of belief in faith and in God\n\nI only did that after YEARS of consistently praying to the Christian 'God' with as much sincerity and hope and faith as I could possibly muster.\n\nTrying out the other major 'Gods' was simply a last-ditch effort to try and connect to ANY spiritual being out there who would care enough to listen and communicate with me.\n\nAt this point, I cannot force myself to believe that your prayers, or those of everyone in the entire world all asking for the same thing with one voice, would ever be heard or answered by any supposed 'God'.\n\nI know other people believe in that stuff, but I am no longer able. It is a false hope, and it makes me sad to see people still clinging to these ideas.\n\nSo, instead of praying for me, or anyone else, I would only ask you to just go out and do something nice for someone, and I will do the same. Physical acts of kindness will do more to improve the world than any prayer ever will."

I go for cold, hard facts, and will not trust or take him, or anyone else, at their word alone without hard, physical evidence that can be tested.\n\nHe (or his followers, who also say to just 'trust' him) tends to say a lot of things about the nature of the universe... which are consistently proven wrong by science and humans. So either he's a liar, or he's not real. I'm guessing the latter, because a lot of his followers seem to get angry about the world not following their rules that were written by bronze-age goat fuckers."

Just because I don't take you (or any religious/supernatural/divine/miraculous claim) at your word doesn't mean I'm a hard-hearted bastard. It means I don' take you at your word because you have provided no support for your claims and beliefs.\n\n>God wants to soften your heart so you will be able to understand his will instead of your own.\n\nWonderful. Evidence that stands up to scientific inquiry and empirical study will suffice in doing so. Until then, my soft heart will remain a skeptical one, and the veracity (or existence) of his 'will' will remain something I do not take seriously.\n\n>It's like in The Matrix movie when Morpheus said to Neo that if real is whatever you can feel, smell, taste, and see, then \"real\" is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain.\n\n>This world is an illusion, but you are placing that illusion before God, and this is what we are told/warned about not to do.\n\nDo you have any evidence to support that claim? I can make up just about whatever bullshit I want to as well. You're saying 'take it on faith'. Well, I need evidence, otherwise your faith is just bullshit. I ain't buying it, and the world you want me to live in will remain a demented fantasy in your head, where it belongs.\n\n>Your mockery of who wrote the rules is humorous, but don't forget how long ago the laws were written by the law makers of this world.\n\n>If Christianity is a man made construct like you think, then that means that some of the laws that are around today are older than what Christianity would actually be, but I bet that you still follow them.\n\nAh, but we also see how our society thrives under certain rules, rules that augment our social disposition of wanting to thrive and survive by being social. It's evolutionary psychology in action. We observe it in nature daily.\n\nWe participate in society because the benefits for most of us outweigh the risks, and for those who go against it and threaten society, we separate or destroy, as the needs of the many outweighs the needs of the few.\n\nThe laws that make sense for society to follow may have a solid historical foundation, but they also survive a period of enlightened, rational, logical discourse. Most Christian laws didn't. Because we knew that it was a bullshit premise to ban the eating of certain kinds of seafood or the wearing of certain fabrics or, nowadays, ban certain sexual acts between consenting adults. Society is allowed to grow, to change, to evolve, not remain stagnant and complacent in an enforced era of the same bronze-aged values that your religion tries to pass off.\n\n>If you also think that Christianity is man made, then that means that you think that God is man made, which means that you are not calling God a liar, but you are calling other humans the liars.\n>\n>So why are you blaming God for things that you think humans created?\n\nAha, finally a point of contention worthy of discourse!\n\nI in fact ***do*** believe that god (especially your idea of what 'god' is) is man-made. And I do in fact believe, in a roundabout way, that other humans are liars about religion and the supernatural. So I in fact do not blame 'god'. There's nothing to blame. There is no 'god' that I can see or experience or observe empirically.\n\nIn the context of this discussion, it's a made up, uber-perfect invisible entity created by human minds to be beyond human physical experiential sensation and given magical abilities to be beyond the scope of what we can test in our universe. And it's made up by cynical, self-centered, generally ethically and morally repugnant cretinous fascists who seek their own dominion and domination over those who might listen to them, and the extermination and annihilation of those who would not."
