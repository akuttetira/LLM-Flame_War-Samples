Yes, if people were more consistent with evidentiary standards then yes a lot of beliefs with weak evidence would go away. There's no real reason to bring this up in a specific attack on theism and it just feels like yet another cringe atheism post."

People can achieve weird stuff with imagination/suggestion/trance states.\n\nDo you honestly believe the claim \"some people can self-induce hallucinations\" to be as unfounded as god-claims?"

When asked to provide evidence on what ‘dumb’ beliefs atheists hold and asked what you consider a ‘belief’ to be, you haven’t given any. Instead you’ve talked about tulpas? Having just looked on that sun there is no evidence to suggest any of them are in fact atheists. If you don’t have anything useful or creative to say then I suggest you don’t write anything"
