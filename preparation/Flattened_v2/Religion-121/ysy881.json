    "text": "The \"outrageous interest\" addition is the modern redefinition that is completely unsupported by scripture. There are dozens of instructions in the Bible clearly stating that you shouldn't charge interest (except *maybe* to foreigners) with never a peep about the amount.\n\nIt is a gotcha, you guys who have spent decades pretending the reason you campaign against equal rights for gay people is scriptual rather that based purely on low bigotry. The number of things you should come for before gay people if what you care about is what Yahweh wants is long. First, remove the beam out of your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck out of your brother's eye.\n\n\n*Exodus 22:25* “If you lend money to any of my people with you who is poor, you shall not be like a moneylender to him, and you shall not exact interest from him.\n\n\n*Ezekiel 18:13*\nLends at interest, and takes profit; shall he then live? He shall not live. He has done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon himself.\n\n\n*Ezekiel 18:17* Withholds his hand from iniquity, takes no interest or profit, obeys my rules, and walks in my statutes; he shall not die for his father's iniquity; he shall surely live.\n\n\n*Leviticus 25:36* Take no interest from him or profit, but fear your God, that your brother may live beside you.\n\n\n*Deuteronomy 23:19-20* “You shall not charge interest on loans to your brother, interest on money, interest on food, interest on anything that is lent for interest. You may charge a foreigner interest, but you may not charge your brother interest, that the Lord your God may bless you in all that you undertake in the land that you are entering to take possession of it."

The lucky ones see through the bullshit, but the unlucky ones get trapped in a cycle of shame and depression. Just look at the suicide rate in LGBT teens in the Mormon community for an example.\n\nYour “morals” aren’t based in empathy, or anything real. Your “morals” are based on a book written by barbaric sheepherders that thought slavery and rape were okay, as long as it was the right people.\n\nIf you can actually read the Bible and think you can take any form of a moral compass from it then you are truly a shit human being.\n\nYou, and people like you are monsters that hurt children. If there is a God I wouldn’t want to be your type of christian on judgement day.\n\nIn closing. Fuck you. Fuck your made up god. Jesus, your cool but nobody actually listens to what you said.\n\nSincerely,\nA straight white male who’s sick of your shit."
