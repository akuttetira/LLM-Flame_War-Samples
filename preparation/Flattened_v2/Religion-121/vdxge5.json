    "text": "This post is full of ridiculous false statements masquerading as an argument.\n\n\nReddit being antiIslam such drivel gets up voted.\n\n\nSee here for a thorough Rebutall of all your nonsense slavery claims.\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/u4x9pc/rebuttal_slavery_in_islam/\n\n\n>>The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Isn't the witness of a woman equal to half of that of a man?\" The women said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"This is because of the deficiency of a woman's mind.\" Sahih al-Bukhari 2658\n\n\nWhy not cite the actual relevant hadith... Oh right because it disproves your lies.\n\n\n>Once Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) went out to the Musalla (to offer the prayer) of `Id-al-Adha or Al-Fitr prayer. Then he passed by the women and said, \"O women! Give alms, as I have seen that the majority of the dwellers of Hell-fire were you (women).\" They asked, \"Why is it so, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ?\" He replied, \"You curse frequently and are ungrateful to your husbands. I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and religion than you. A cautious sensible man could be led astray by some of you.\" The women asked, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! What is deficient in our intelligence and religion?\" He said, \"Is not the evidence of two women equal to the witness of one man?\" They replied in the affirmative. He said, \"This is the deficiency in her intelligence. Isn't it true that a woman can neither pray nor fast during her menses?\" The women replied in the affirmative. He said, \"This is the deficiency in her religion.\"\n\n\nhttps://sunnah.com/bukhari:304\n\n\n>>“…Call upon two of your men to witness. If two men cannot be found, then one man and two women of your choice will witness—so if one of the women forgets the other may remind her.” Quran 2:282\n\n\n\n\nAs if the Amber Heard trial didn't just happen proving that rule as correct.\n\n\nIt's a common English expression \"Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned\".\n\n\nThe punishments for someone accused of crimes is severe so requiring a high standard of proof is a necessity.\n\n\n>>Not only are women counted as half a witness due to the “deficiency of their minds,” but they also only get half of their inheritance:\n\n\nAgain more nonsense from someone who has enough information to mislead without substance.\n\n\nIn Islam men are legally obligated to provide for the women in their families. **So as a single man you have to financially support your unmarried sisters & wife. A wife's money is her own but a husband's money is the families. So with greater responsibilities come greater rights.**\n\n\nBeyond that women get greater rights in a lot of areas like who to love most is your mother, your mother, your mother, then your father. So mom gets 🥇 🥈 🥉 and dad gets a participation trophy. Also heaven is under your mother's feet. Super misogynistic...\n\n\nBeyond that it's laughable for a Westerner to criticize Islam on women when Islam gave women rights 1300 to 1400 years before the West did.\n\n\nWomen only legally became people in Canada in 1922. Before that they were chattels so mobile property like a cow or car. In the US women weren't allowed to open bank accounts until the 1960s.\n\n\n>>\"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"If a husband calls his wife to his bed (i.e. to have sexual relation) and she refuses and causes him to sleep in anger, the angels will curse her till morning.\" Sahih al-Bukhari 3237\n\n\n>>Yes, you read that right. Under Islam, women can’t refuse sex with her husband.\n\n\nWe read that you're a lying Islamophobe right.\n\n\nWhy did the husband go to bed angry if the women can't refuse sex? Oh that's right because the woman refused sex and he's obligated to respect that\n\n\nDid the woman get any bad deeds for refusing sex? No.\n\n\nWhy did the angels curse her? Because she's bringing calamities to her home. Leaving your spouse unsatisfied results in an increased propensity to divorce or cheat. Adultery condemns the man the hell. Beyond that he could catch a disease and bring that to her. Or harm an innocent child by creating one outside of wedlock. All of which are not just harmful to the woman and her husband but also to society.\n\n\nDo you want me to give you the massive list of social harms that come from divorce?\n\n\n>Men can refuse sex with their wives whenever they want\n\n\nNo they cannot. Inability to sexually please your wife is a valid grounds for divorce. Beyond that it's a marital duty of a husband as it is of a wife.\n\n\nHusbands and wives get good deeds as if they're worshipping Allah when they please each other. Again because Islam protects and preserves the family.\n\n\nhttps://sunnah.com/muslim:1006\n\n\nYour need to resort to lies to slander Islam is pretty pathetic. It proves the fact that you can't find legitimate issues with Islam.\n\n\n>>Muhammad, for example, kept 4 slave concubines along with his 11 other wives.\n\n\nI see what you're trying to claim which is Prophet Muhammad PBUH was sexually immoral but let's look at how absurd your claim is:\n\n\n>The Prophet’s married life can be classified as follows:\n\n\n\n>Until the age of 25: he was single.\n\n\n>Age 25 – 50: he was married only to Khadîjah.\n\n\n>Age 50 – 52: he was single after Khadîjah’s death.\n\n\n>Age 53 – his death at the age of 63: he had a total of ten wives. Many of these marriages were to widows (who had been left with their children without a provider) and in some cases to foster stronger ties with some of his companions and neighbouring tribes. Of all the women he married, ’Ȃishah was the only virgin.\n\n\n\nClear Quran 33:51 footnote 1\n\n\nSo Prophet Muhammad PBUH decided to become a sexual deviant استغفر الله (I seek forgiveness of Allah) at the age of 53? He was a ruler of a powerful empire. He could have had any and all women he wanted. He wouldn't be choosing widows. However as usual islamophones take something beautiful about Islam and try to falsely portray it as negative.\n\n\n>>In fact, Sahih Muslim 3371 describes Muhammad-approved acts of rape and ransom that are eerily similar to those committed by ISIS and other terrorist groups\n\n\nMore dishonesty. The hadith makes no claim of anything you stated. It just says pulling out isn't necessary. My rebuttal of slavery in Islam already proves the sex was consensual.\n\n\nAlso nice lies about ISIS being theologically secure.\n\n\nSee quran.com/109\n\n\n>Let there be no compulsion in religion, for the truth stands out clearly from falsehood.1 So whoever renounces false gods and believes in Allah has certainly grasped the firmest, unfailing hand-hold. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.\n\n\n>Footnote 1\n\n\n>This verse was revealed when some new Muslims tried to force their Jewish and Christian children to convert to Islam after the Prophet’s emigration (Hijrah) to Medina. The verse prohibits forced conversion.\n\n\nQuran 2:256\n\n\n>whoever takes a life—unless as a punishment for murder or mischief in the land—it will be as if they killed all of humanity; and whoever saves a life, it will be as if they saved all of humanity.1 ˹Although˺ Our messengers already came to them with clear proofs, many of them still transgressed afterwards through the land.\n\n\nQuran 5:32\n\n\n>>It is abundantly clear that Islam was conceived by primitive patriarchal 7th century male warlords\n\n\nMore lies. So in 7th century a Genderless God is from a patriarchal war lord? Prophet Muhammad PBUH never waged a war without improving the situation of the people liberated. Beyond that all the 4 Sunni Caliphates do not have a single blemish of genocide. Which cannot be stated for any other empire or Western country.\n\n\nThe largest empires the world had ever seen for 1300 years.\n\n\nUnfortunately this is a common theme among reddit. A liar such as yourself will make a false statement that is seen by many. Unfortunately the refutation will be seen by few."

    "text": "I've literally quoted you Prophet Muhammad PBUH statement. I'll do it again because you seem to have missed it.\n\n\n>\"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! What is deficient in our intelligence and religion?\" He said, \"Is not the evidence of two women equal to the witness of one man?\" They replied in the affirmative. He said, \"This is the deficiency in her intelligence. Isn't it true that a woman can neither pray nor fast during her menses?\" The women replied in the affirmative. He said, \"This is the deficiency in her religion.\"\n\n\nIn Islam depending on the crime we require for 2 to 4 male witnesses so we already acknowledge that men can also make mistakes or their testimony can be unreliable. So not sure of your argument here.\n\n\nSince women are more emotional and can be less reliable as witnesses you need 2 women to replace 1 man as a witness.\n\n\nAlso our witnesses have to be of upstanding moral character so a gossip, someone who spies on neighbours, drinks alcohol (if Muslim), steals, etc... Cannot be a witness to certain crimes for example. Your general behaviour greatly affects your quality as a witness.\n\n\nIn the event of someone accusing an unrelated woman of adultery or later their wife of adultery if they do not have witnesses and its he said VS she said this is how it's handled in the Quran.\n\n\n>Those who accuse chaste women ˹of adultery˺ and fail to produce four witnesses, give them eighty lashes ˹each˺. And do not ever accept any testimony from them—for they are indeed the rebellious\n\n\n>except those who repent afterwards and mend their ways, then surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\n\n\n>And those who accuse their wives ˹of adultery˺ but have no witness except themselves, the accuser must testify,1 swearing four times by Allah that he is telling the truth,\n\n\n>Footnote 1\n\n\n>In order to be spared the punishment for false accusation.\n\n\n>and a fifth oath that Allah may condemn him if he is lying.\n\n\n>For her to be spared the punishment, she must swear four times by Allah that he is telling a lie,\n\n\n>and a fifth oath that Allah may be displeased with her if he is telling the truth.1\n\n\n\n>Footnote 1\n\n\n>This ruling is called li’ân in Islamic legal system. Once the husband and the wife swear each five times, as specified in 24:6-9, the marriage is terminated forever—which means that they can never be remarried.\n\n\nQuran 24:4-9\n\n\nSo as you can see in a he said she said situation both a man and a woman's testimony are treated as equal. However to punish someone in an accusation of another only then do you need 2 women witnesses to replace a man.\n\n\nOur religion is perfect. People can try to attack it but they usually have to resort to lies. Since when dealing with the truth and somebody knowledgeable their arguments completely fall apart. Like in this thread for example.\n\n\nI noticed in your flair you're Jewish. I have a question. How can you believe in a religion that's to the benefit of a certain group of people to the exclusion of all others?\n\n\nWhy wouldn't Allah/God want to benefit all mankind? How is that consistent with the final religion of a benevolent creator?\n\n\nI'm sure you're aware as Muslims we follow Prophets Abraham, Moses, Solomon, Jesus, etc... PBUT"

    "text": ">Not being a reliable witness is not stupidity. It has to do with emotions. Intelligence being over-ridden by emotion is what is being referred to.\n\nSure women are emotional. What you're not getting is that men are *just as emotional as women*. It is only your arrogance and ego and misogyny that convinces you that men are somehow superior in that regard (or any regard).\n\nRationality and emotional intelligence do not come naturally to human beings, no matter what sex they are. It has to be actively taught and learned. And it's just as easy for women to learn it as men.\n\nThe problem is that we don't teach it. What's worse is all too often we teach the exact opposite while convincing people that it's rationality.\n\nExactly like what your teachers did to you."

Women are superior to men in other areas. The genders are equal but different.\n\n\nThat's the whole purpose of having 2 genders. Otherwise humans would only have one gender if we were to be identical.\n\n\nThis is the problem you're fed a bunch of propaganda that makes you feel good but is not an accurate portrayal of the world or even science.\n\n\nMen are physically stronger than women. That's a fact of life. In physical strength men are superior to women.\n\n\nWomen live longer than men. In longevity women are superior to men.\n\n\nIt's two parts to complete the whole.\n\n\nWomen are more emotional, sensitive, and loving as a mercy from Allah. That's why they carry life and nurture it from their bodies. Babies can bite nipples and that's painful so women are designed to have their emotions outweigh their memory to help maintain that loving connection with that child.\n\n\n\nA direct result of mother's being superior to the ULTIMATE value in life parenthood they're slightly inferior as witnesses. One is significantly more important than the other.\n\n\nYet Western propaganda has you thinking Islam is bad for maintaining that women are the more valuable parents but less valuable witnesses. Especially when in Islam among the most important jobs on earth is parenthood. A far higher percentage of women end up mothers VS witnesses in court.\n\n\nThis is the moral and intellectual bankruptcy of those that attack Islam. They pick and choose small parts of an equation to misrepresent the Muslim view.\n\n\nThe reason they need to misrepresent Islam is because they know once represented properly people end up Muslim. That's why 4 out of every 5 reverts to Islam in the US & 3 out of every 4 in the UK are women. Islam liberates women despite what all the propagandists try to teach."

Women are more emotional by nature of their hormones. I know it's taboo in the present ridiculous environment to state obvious facts but facts are facts.\n\n\nI'm not seeing your complaint at all. There's things women are worse at and there's things men are worse at.\n\n\nFor example if men could play in the WNBA there'd be no WNBA it'd just be 2 men's leagues. That's not sexist that's a fact. Just like saying men can't get pregnant only women can isn't sexist.\n\n\nBeing a witness is not a thing present in the vast majority of people's lives. Far more people end up needing financial support or having children both of which women get preference over men.\n\n\nWomen are equal but different. Ignoring that is ignorance."

In this Hadith, Muhammad says women's minds are deficient, as well as a bunch of other absurd misogynistic claims (there are more women in hell because they are emotional, women lead you astray, women can't pray or fast during menstruation because they are impure) that make Islam look even more sexist and primitive.

So why did he choose a 6-year-old girl? I thought Muhammad was supposed to set a moral example for all of humanity across time.

Why does Allah permit sex slavery in the first place? Why did Muhammad own 4 slave concubines?\n\nOf course, you'll never be able to answer these questions properly without calling me an Islamophobe and obscuring facts or making up same insane sexist claim. Or, you'll be honest about your beliefs and say \"yes, Allah is all-knowing so sex slavery is ok, women are stupid, and it was fine for Muhammad, the most moral man to ever exist, to rape a 6-year-old girl, own slave concubines, and commit mass murder.\" Actually, you already said that \"women are stupid\" in your reply anyway."

Do you know what marital rape is?\n\nI know quite clearly. Where was the lack of consent? It seems you do not. It stated if she doesn't consent the husband should go to bed angry. That means no sex takes place.\n\nAre you really doubling down on stupid? Just admit you're wrong and move on.\n\nIslam forbids me from drinking alcohol. I still choose to obey. That's consent. I can ignore the rules and drink if I want to.\n\n>And how old was Ȃishah when Muhammad married her?

Acknowledging differences isn't \"sexist\" it's a fact.\n\nThat's why women have separate sports leagues. Men and women are equal but different. That's why women get advantages in many areas and men get advantages in some areas. Islam is harmonious with nature. Western society is not. That's proven by the rates of depression, mental illness, and how broken society is specifically via the family unit, drugs, alcohol, etc...\n\nBut let's not let facts get in the way of your argument.\n\n>Ah yes, he only peacefully committed mass murder...\n\nLOL at linking an Islamophobic website as a source. Do you link stormfront when debating with Jews?\n\nList a \"mass murder\" most of that link is single individuals who died and that list is nonsense.\n\n>Ah yes, the Caliphates only peacefully committed genocide...\n\nAgain same Islamophobic website. I'll do you one better name a genocide or two and let's see how I debunk them.\n\n>As for slavery, you did not address sex slavery, only manual labor slavery. Why does Allah permit sex slavery in the first place? Why did Muhammad own 4 slave concubines?\n\nI see you suck at reading and comprehension. I'm glad you're putting it on full display. I showed you all slavery you're just too stupid to understand basic things. Slapping a slave results in their freedom yet you're arguing for rape?\n\nSex slavery isn't a thing but again don't let facts get in the way of your stupidity.\n\nYour mind is so warped by the Western concept of slavery that you weren't able to comprehend a massive write up.\n\nPlus let's look at the rate at which people in modern western society are loose with their sexuality and all sorts of perversions such as cuckolding and then you're going to try to argue with a straight face that these \"slaves\" didn't want to engage in consensual sexual intercourse? Really? When their masters treated them better than they'd ever been treated as is evidenced by my write up and what we know about women's rights in non-Islamic societies?\n\n>Of course, you'll never be able to answer these questions without saying \"yes, Allah is all-knowing so sex slavery is ok, women are stupid, and it was fine for Muhammad, the most moral man to ever exist, to rape a 6-year-old girl, own slave concubines, and commit mass murder.\" Actually, you already said that \"women are stupid\" in your reply anyway.\n\nWomen aren't stupid but your arguments sure are. It's very telling that after getting called out and corrected on everything you resort to more lies and strawmen. An exceptionally bad strategy\n\nI'm a little embarrassed for you. You've come to a battle of wits completely unarmed.\n\nI'll give you a piece of advice. What separates stupid people from not stupid people is when presented with new information not stupid people learn. Try that out for once. Stupidity is a choice you don't have to make.\n\n**Edit:**\n\nForgot to add Aisha RA the woman you keep trying to falsely portray as a victim was the greatest Islamic Scholar, a political leader, and a general.\n\nRufaida Al Aslamia RA was a companion of the Prophet Muhammad PBUH & the first woman surgeon in the world.\n\nThe oldest continuously operating University on Earth was started by Fatima Al Fihri a Muslim woman.\n\nFunny how we supposedly don't respect women yet we have so many of their greatest accomplishments."

Different societies at different times have different needs.\n\n\nWe live in an age with extended childhood so a 9 year old today would not be mentally mature for marriage. Even an 18 year old today might not be. That's the thing with mental maturities. They're time and person specific.\n\n\nHowever in extreme circumstances people mature earlier and have lower life expectancies you need a low minimum age for a religion for all time. Otherwise bloodlines, populations, and societies die off.\n\n\nAn example I've already provided was the industrial revolution in the UK which again was a little over 100 years ago. When a miner's life expectancy is in the 20s they will need to have children early. People are rarely perfectly healthy then drop dead at 20 so their health deteriorates rapidly.\n\n\nAnother example of an extreme time is the deserts of Arabia in the 7th century.\n\n\nThat age might drop down again in the future in extreme circumstances for example if there's a nuclear war and radiation wipes people out and life expectancies collapse again.\n\n\nWhen you reduce Aisha RA to the terrible things you say you do HER a disservice. She was **the greatest** scholar, strong, mature, highly intelligent and a leader. Her entire society, her family, and all of human history had no problem with her marriage. She was and continues to be greatly admired.\n\n\nYou are the product of a society that doesn't even know what a woman is. **So you shouldn't presume the values you have right now are the best ones for all time**. Especially when the society you have now is fundamentally broken with high divorce rates, high single parent households, STIs, depression, drug and alcohol abuse, damaging children with this LGBT+ propaganda, early access to extreme pornography, record rates of ED among young men, etc..."

Bloody hell you're dangerous.\nIf that's the case, why didn't he have more young brides?\n\nFunny you mention bloodlines when something like 75% of the Islamic world is inbred. If you think that's keeping your \"bloodlines\" pure, you are very very mistaken. I'm sure you're going to say that's islamophobic propaganda or some weak excuse like that. As you've used personal anecdotes in the argument, so will I. In the huge mulsim community in my country, there are much higher rates of disabilities and mental illnesses. This has been attributed to the inbreeding between siblings and cousins. I personally know many Muslim people here who are children of their relatives. Many disabled Muslims, disfigured and in pain.\n\nOkay. So you've admitted the edict is from a different period of human history right? Then why do you defend such practices today?\n\nThe whole of Human history had no issue with her marriage? You do realise human history is constantly being written as time goes on? And that no one today apart from your radical islamic friends find this okay?\nMaybe she could have been someone even more accomplished if she hadn't been married off at 6.\n\nWhy do you even care about her accomplishments? Are her accomplishments somehow justification for being raped at 9? Explain your logic please.\n\nHow exactly do you know that? What do you know about me and who I am or what society I live in? Do you know why the divorce rate has increased? Because women are becoming more and more educated and independent. Something I'm sure you're vehemently against. They no longer are forced, as Aisha was, into marriage at a young age. They are independent and don't have to put up with their spouses abuse anymore, as they had to do in the less secular days of humanity."

Adolescence has been significantly extended.\n\n\nSpartans started rigorous military training at age 7. In the US civil war the Confederacy had 12 year olds fighting for them. Momčilo Gavrić of Serbia became a soldier at 8 in 1914. Seryozha Aleshkov served in WW2 at the age of 6 and earned a medal. The Koryos military units started at age 12 they were sent to live in the wilderness, stealing and hunting to survive.\n\n\nWe've even reached the age of permanent mental immaturity where you have people that never properly develop. We've got a generation of man children.\n\n\n>If that's the case, why didn't he have more young brides?\n\n\nIsn't that refuting your own argument? Most of his wives were widows or divorcees. He was the most powerful person in the area he could have married anybody he liked.\n\n\n>Funny you mention bloodlines when something like 75% of the Islamic world is inbred\n\n\nOh so you're one of those dumbass bigots because that's completely made up.\n\n\n😂 At you obviously knowing your comment is Islamophobic and false and then mentioning it anyways.\n\n\n>Then why do you defend such practices today?\n\n\nWho's doing that practice in Western countries today? Again mental maturity is a requirement. If you're in an undeveloped place in Africa with high mortality rates and low life expectancies marriage age goes down.\n\n\n>Maybe she could have been someone even more accomplished if she hadn't been married off at 6.\n\n\nFalse. You're just making nonsense up. She was married to him so that she could accomplish those feats.\n\n\n>Are her accomplishments somehow justification for being raped at 9?\n\n\nNot raped. Again more BS from you. We have more details of their marriage than any other marriage in history and the bulk of it comes from her and it was a loving and happy marriage. She was thrilled to be marrying him. It was their cultural norm too. A norm that continued in Europe and the US until recently. You don't get to go back and change people's consent retroactively especially when we've already established that you're a bad faith actor.\n\n\n>Because women are becoming more and more educated and independent.\n\n\nMore educated than when they were founding universities and being scholars?\n\n\nNo it's a values thing because society is becoming increasingly selfish, sexualized, and the more sexual partners women have prior to marriage the higher their statistical likelihood of divorce. You've got media propaganda brainwashing young women into many harmful habits.\n\n\nThere's studies on the negative effects of social media and its most harmful to teenage girls. I was having this discussion with a psychology PhD this weekend.\n\n\nhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/tween-and-teen-health/in-depth/teens-and-social-media-use/art-20474437\n\n\nThat same harmful propaganda is responsible for the LGBT+ rate in the US skyrocketing to 20% in gen Z.\n\n\nI know you like to think the West is the best at everything but it's always been the worst at marriage. The highest divorce rates, lowest marital rates, etc... Since Muslims continue to enjoy lower divorce rates and higher life satisfaction in going to go with Muslim values being superior. Muslims also give the most to charity.\n\n\nI don't need a miserable person with miserable values to try to correct happy people with happy values.\n\n\nYou can't even enjoy life sober and you want to pretend your opinion is worth anything?\n\n\n>Something I'm sure you're vehemently against\n\n\nAlso LOL at your straw man. Every woman in my family has at least a Bachelor's degree. Education is highly valued in Islam. We tend to pursue knowledge since we don't waste our time high and drunk.\n\n\nNow pardon me if I stop responding to you because your ignorance is exceptional. There's better places to use my time than arguing with you."

They were legally Chattels before that which is mobile property like a car or a cow.\n\nWomen weren't allowed to have their own bank accounts in the US until the 1960s-1980s depending on the State.\n\nIn the UK women got the right to inherit in 1870.\n\nSo Islam beat the West by 1200-1300 years there.\n\nThe first woman surgeon in the world was Rufaida Al Aslamia RA again 1300 years before the first western woman became a surgeon.\n\nThe world's oldest existing university was founded by Fatima Al Fihri in the 9th century. Women have to be VERY empowered to be founding Universities.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad PBUH wives had jobs. Khadija RA was a successful business woman. Aisha RA was considered **the greatest scholar** among the Sahaba RA. She was also a Leader and General.\n\nNusaybah bint Ka'ab RA & Khawla bint al-Azwar RA were two valiant women warriors who served on the front lines. With Khawla RA being considered the greatest woman warrior in history. She was frequently compared to the greatest general in history Khaled Ibn Walid RA.\n\nSo we had women in leadership roles and leading battles far before many Western Countries. The US for example got it's first woman general in 1920 & Anna Mae Hays was never in combat she was in Vietnam in charge of the Nurses. Women were banned from Combat roles in the US until 1994. I think the first woman in the US military to be in combat was in 2005. In 2016 exclusions of women from ground close combat roles in the UK were lifted. Germany lifted exclusions for women in their military in 2001. Canada was more progressive and opened all combat roles to women in 1989. So Again Islam was ahead by 1300 to 1400 years prior.\n\nSumayyah bint Khabbat RA was the first martyr in Islam. As Muslims we believe Allah chooses things for a reason so it's very significant that our first Martyr was a woman.\n\nI have a video series exposing anti-Muslim biases you should consider watching it\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4m17abiBiV4&list=PLOkgFwdFkBuj7Au7\\_tCglJG7DkzT2Ho3z](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4m17abiBiV4&list=PLOkgFwdFkBuj7Au7_tCglJG7DkzT2Ho3z)"

Also, the frontal cortex (frontal lobes), which help to regulate impulses coming from the amygdala, is (are) more active in women”. you’re getting the idea, right? 2. women are less impulsive than men thanks to a more active prefrontal cortex, which also has to do with decision making and certain emotional control. 3. testosterone is a hormone responsible for aggressive, the strongest and most dangerous emotion. 4. men make up 80% of all types of crimes and the more violent a crime is, the bigger the gender gap gets. men commit more crimes due to poor emotional control. 4. most importantly, when in a stressful situation, male body responds by producing testosterone which is a hormone responsible for aggression. a female body responds to stress by producing oxytocin which has anti stress effects such as reduction of blood pressure,cortisol levels & has anxiolytic effect. in conclusion, women are able to control emotions better, therefore deserve to have stronger testimony by islamic logic. but islam and science are antonyms"

It’s so annoying.\n\nJust one hadith is enough to prove you wrong, all the hadiths cited are about treating them well or whatever. Not having them.\n\n[A man emancipated six slaved at the time of his death and he had no other property. The Prophet (ﷺ) was informed about it. He cast lots among them, emancipated two and retained four in slavery.](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:3961)\n\nYeah, returning already freed slaves into slavery by casting a lot to decide which one gets to be a slave, he seems to be very against slavery…\n\n>Why not cite the actual relevant hadith... Oh right because it disproves your lies\n\nIt just helps him!\n\n>Once Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) went out to the Musalla (to offer the prayer) of `Id-al-Adha or Al-Fitr prayer. Then he passed by the women and said, \"O women! Give alms, as I have seen that the majority of the dwellers of Hell-fire were you (women).\" They asked, \"Why is it so, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ?\" He replied, \"You curse frequently and are ungrateful to your husbands. I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and religion than you. A cautious sensible man could be led astray by some of you.\" The women asked, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! What is deficient in our intelligence and religion?\" He said, \"Is not the evidence of two women equal to the witness of one man?\" They replied in the affirmative. He said, \"This is the deficiency in her intelligence. Isn't it true that a woman can neither pray nor fast during her menses?\" The women replied in the affirmative. He said, \"This is the deficiency in her religion.\"\n\nHow the hell does this prove anything. He straight up calls them stupid and sinful distractions for men. Is this how you justify his misogyny?\n\nThis proves the reason a women’s witness is half a man’s because Muhammad thinks they are stupid! How is this not misogynistic?\n\n>As if the Amber Heard trial didn't just happen proving that rule as correct.\n\nHow? What? You think a terrible woman lying in court proves *women in general* are untrustworthy/liars? Do you know how many cases of *men* lying in court there is too?\n\nComing to conclusions about women in general by just one terrible woman is misogynistic. Why not talk about all the other women who fought for righteousness and honesty?\n\n>It's a common English expression \"Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned\".\n\nSo we are now shaping how society should treat certain groups by  *folk expressions*? Really?\n\n>The punishments for someone accused of crimes is severe so requiring a high standard of proof is a necessity.\n\nThe problem is a women is half as trustable as a men according to the misogynistic Quran. Not that it requires witnesses.\n\n>Again more nonsense from someone who has enough information to mislead without substance.\n\n>In Islam men are legally obligated to provide for the women in their families. So as a single man you have to financially support your unmarried sisters & wife. A wife's money is her own but a husband's money is the families. So with greater responsibilities come greater rights.\n\nExactly the problem. Women are financially and socially dependent on men according to Islam, men have the freedom and make the decisions. Women are treated as fragile things like kids that should stay home for most of the time and obey the husband.\n\nIslam makes women dependent on men where they are denied of their potential as a free and functioning normal citizen. That’s the exact problem. That’s why women get less inheritance, because they are supposed to be dependent.\n\n>Beyond that women get greater rights in a lot of areas like who to love most is your mother, your mother, your mother, then your father. So mom gets 🥇 🥈 🥉 and dad gets a participation trophy. Also heaven is under your mother's feet. Super misogynistic...\n\nYeah, sure. A mom is supposed to be more loved! Yay! Still no freedom or rights though… But we say we love you! I don’t even see any sources on that claim but assuming it’s true that does not solve the aforementioned problems.\n\nDad does not get a participation trophy , he gets the right to control almost everything the women does including when they fuck. No seriously,[angels curse a women who denies his husband sex.](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2141)\n\nIslam does not hate *all women*, it looooves women who are obedient. Who always stay at home, do whatever the husband wants, take care of the kids at home, do the errands, cook food, etc. It loves women who do not try to be their own person and become independent. That’s why heaven is under *mothers’ feet* not *womens’*.\n\n>Beyond that it's laughable for a Westerner to criticize Islam on women when Islam gave women rights 1300 to 1400 years before the West did.\n\n>Women only legally became people in Canada in 1922. Before that they were chattels so mobile property like a cow or car. In the US women weren't allowed to open bank accounts until the 1960s.\n\nIslam gave women rights such as..?\n\nThis whole “the west tough” bullshit is enough. This debate isn’t even about the west, you are just showing how you are a bigot who sees anything against Islam as “EVIL WEST is islamaphobic and is lying on purpose”.\n\n**It didn’t fit so the continuation is in my reply to myself.**"

    "text": ">We read that you're a lying Islamophobe right.\n\nStop calling any kind of criticism of Islam islamaphobic. It just shows that your coping mechanism is to label anything bad about Islam as islamaphobic.\n\nLet me ask you this: How can someone critize Islam without being an islamaphobe? Is every atheistic argument islamaphobic? This would show the true nature of your “islamaphobia”.\n\n>Why did the husband go to bed angry if the women can't refuse sex? Oh that's right because the woman refused sex and he's obligated to respect that\n\nOh wow, the husbands can’t physically force women to have sex (which is rape), how great! What more do you want?\n\n>Why did the angels curse her? Because she's bringing calamities to her home. Leaving your spouse unsatisfied results in an increased propensity to divorce or cheat. Adultery condemns the man the hell. Beyond that he could catch a disease and bring that to her. Or harm an innocent child by creating one outside of wedlock. All of which are not just harmful to the woman and her husband but also to society.\n\nSo, a women should fuck whenever his husbands wants since a according to Islam a marriage can’t be sustained without the husband having some pussy.\n\nSo a rightful women should have sex even if she does not want it so that the marriage doesn’t fall apart (because we all now that having sex whenever the husband want is the only way to have a sustainable marriage), and if it does it’s the women to blame.\n\nThis is some next level gaslighting.\n\n>Do you want me to give you the massive list of social harms that come from divorce?\n\nJust stop.\n\nA relationship where you shouldn’t even refuse sex is way more toxic than any bullshit reason you would say.\n\nA relationship in which someone’s desires are the priority and someone has the majority of the control is toxic, unhealthy and not sustainable. That’s what leads to divorce, not not having sex sometimes cause the woman wasn’t horny enough.\n\nFunny how the same doesn’t go for men, do angels curse men who refuse their wives’ call to bed? Didn’t think so.\n\n“Look she wasn’t willing to have sex whenever I wanted it so our marriage fell apart.”\n\n>No they cannot. Inability to sexually please your wife is a valid grounds for divorce. Beyond that it's a marital duty of a husband as it is of a wife.\n\nShow me where it says they can’t. They can, and no angels cursing them this time for some reason.\n\nYeah sure the wife can divorce him but so can the husband, the any difference is that angels do not curse a man who refuses his wife’s call to bed.\n\nSee? That’s the problem. Technically you can divorce your partner for whatever reason you want, however the man does not seem to be cursed for using this freedom while the woman is\n\n>Husbands and wives get good deeds as if they're worshipping Allah when they please each other. Again because Islam protects and preserves the family.\n\nNo. Because Islam encourages making as many children as possible.\n\nAnd it’s obvious how it is beneficial to a religion’s growth.\n\nIt is just a strategic rule Muhammad made up.\n\n>Your need to resort to lies to slander Islam is pretty pathetic. It proves the fact that you can't find legitimate issues with Islam.\n\nOh come on. Really?\n\n>I see what you're trying to claim which is Prophet Muhammad PBUH was sexually immoral but let's look at how absurd your claim is:\n\n>The Prophet’s married life can be classified as follows:\n\n>Until the age of 25: he was single\n\nCause he wasn’t believed to be prophet yet, lol.\n\n>Age 25 – 50: he was married only to Khadîjah\n\nYeah. Who suspiciously immediately agreed to follow him, as if they were in this together.\n\nAnd for some reason this oh so gentleman and generous Muhammad didn’t “help” widows by marrying them until she died. Surprise surprise, the more misogynistic verses came after her death. Almost as if she had some control in what Muhammad said.\n\n>Age 50 – 52: he was single after Khadîjah’s death.\n\nIncredible. Being single for 2 years while trying to start a religion. Pure chivalry.\n\n>Age 53 – his death at the age of 63: he had a total of ten wives. Many of these marriages were to widows (who had been left with their children without a provider) and in some cases to foster stronger ties with some of his companions and neighbouring tribes. Of all the women he married, ’Ȃishah was the only virgin.\n\nAisha was also the only [nine year old](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3255) he fucked. Forgot about that part.\n\nHe also liked to [kiss and fondle his wives while they are fasting](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:729).\n\nAlso supposedly he slept with [nine wives in one night](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3198).\n\nWhat’s also so weird is that Muhammad almost exclusively married young, beautiful and healthy women. He seems to be very uninterested in “helping” widows of his own age, so basically all of his wives were way younger than him. Not suspicious at all…\n\nHe didn’t start his “harem” before his wife who was there when he started the religion (and is most likely to know about his true colors) died. I guess he wasn’t feeling like helping widows then.\n\n>So Prophet Muhammad PBUH decided to become a sexual deviant استغفر الله (I seek forgiveness of Allah) at the age of 53?\n\nThat’s when he got power and his first wife died, so yes.\n\nWith every new wife he got, his wives became more furious. He did try to get some virgins, and he did (Aisha) but he was starting to push his luck. Cause even women at the time didn’t like their husbands having multiple wives.\n\nThere’s actually a pretty great post about it: [Why did Muhammad marry widows?](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/px4exx/excuse_by_islam_apologists_prophet_wed_only_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nI don’t normally like just posting links, but this is an exception cause you did it too.\n\n>He was a ruler of a powerful empire. He could have had any and all women he wanted.\n\nAnd he did. He even fucked his friends daughter (Aisha) who wasn’t normally willing to give his kid.\n\nAnd he still had some limitations. People around him and even women could have protested, and they did from time to time. For example: [When Nisa 34 was reveal women came to Muhammad’s house complaining.](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:1985)\n\n>He wouldn't be choosing widows.\n\nWhy? Other personal reasons? Maybe almost anyone above the age 20 was already married since an unmarried woman was frowned upon so only way to find a virgin was to go way young (9 year old Aisha). By your logic someone marrying a widow can’t be a pervert by default?\n\nAnyway, even then his *favorite* was the virgin Aisha. He even died on her lap.\n\n>However as usual islamophones take something beautiful about Islam and try to falsely portray it as negative.\n\nHe didn’t even let his wives remarry after his death. So he left them permanent widows. How great!\n\nYou should really stop with this islamaphobe bullshit, maybe you would actually consider listening to the other side.\n\n**Rest is in the reply.**"

However, when a woman is intelligent and remembers and is trustworthy in her religion, then the purpose [of testimony] is attained through her statement just as it is in her transmissions [in] religious [contexts] The Qur’an does not state that a judgment must be passed by only two male witnesses, or one man and two women. God [swt] stipulates that two witnesses are to be brought by those who have [financial] rights in order to secure their [financial] rights with the number of witnesses. However, He does not order judges to pass their rulings according to it. Therefore, the judge can pass judgment in the event that someone refuses to give a testimony, or refuses to take an oath. Also, the judge could use the testimony of one woman, or of women without the presence of men. In these cases, the judge would further investigate the case in regards to the reputation, age, and number of those providing their testimony. ( Fadel, p. 197; Ibn al-Qayyim, Iʿlām al-muwaqqaīn, 3 vols., ed. Ṭāhā ʿAbd al-Raʾūf Saʿd (Beirut: Dār al-Jīl, n.d.), 1:95. )\n\nIbn Taymiyah:\n\nJustified the wisdom of making the testimony of two women equal to that of one man in financial issues, by arguing that women did not usually deal with these types of financial transactions in their social context. However, if a woman gained experience and fully understood these matters, then her testimony would be regarded as equivalent to that of a man. He said, ‘There is no doubt that the purpose of plurality is experience with finance. However, if a woman acquires such experience and her truthfulness is recognized, then the evidence [al-bayyanah] can be proven by her testimony and it is accepted in religious issues. Therefore, her sole testimony is accepted in certain situations. The testimony of two women and the oath of the claimant are accepted according to Imam Malik and a narration of Imam Ahmad.’\n\nIbn Qudamah:\n\nThe testimony of one woman is accepted in every case where the testimony of women alone is accepted.’ ‘Uqbah Ibn Al-Harith asked the Messenger of God [pbuh] saying, ‘I married a woman, then a female slave came to me and said, ‘I suckled you both.’ Accordingly, the Prophet [pbuh] ordered them to separate. He said she is a liar. Then, the Messenger [pbuh] said, ‘Leave [divorce] her.’ Ibn Al-Qayyim commented on this saying, ‘This means that the testimony of one woman was accepted, even though she was a female slave.’ Ma‘ruf Ad-Dawalibi commented on this elegantly saying, ‘The Shari‘ah generally places more emphasis on the testimony pertaining to financial issues, by adding another man beside the first one in order to confirm his testimony and to remove any doubt.\n\nSheikh Mahmud Shaltut: Agreed with the independent reasoning of Ibn Taymiyah, Ibn Al-Qayyim and Muhammad ‘Abdu. He said that when a woman’s testimony in the issue of Li‘an is equal to that of a man, it vindicates her capabilities and contradicts what the critics allege. He mentioned that the following verse, ‘And if there are not two men [available], then a man and two women…’ [Al-Baqarah, 2: 282] does not refer to the testimony which a judge uses to pass judgment, but rather stands as guidance [irshad] to the ways whereby dealers can be assured of their rights at the time their transactions are made. This does not mean that the truth cannot be proven by the testimony of one woman, or by the testimony of women without men, or that a judge cannot pass judgment accordingly. What the judge needs is evidence [Al-bayyinah].\n\nhttps://yaqeeninstitute.org/nazir-khan/women-in-islamic-law-examining-five-prevalent-myths/\n\nhttp://www.dar-alifta.org/Foreign/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=143&text=testimony\n\nAnother argument can be that the verse only referred to us being a witness to a contract of debt even then take it as face value it doesnt mean it should be applied to everything either.\n\n\n>Exactly the problem. Women are financially and socially dependent on men according to Islam, men have the freedom and make the decisions. Women are treated as fragile things like kids that should stay home for most of the time and obey the husband.\nIslam makes women dependent on men where they are denied of their potential as a free and functioning normal citizen.

Who always stay at home, do whatever the husband wants, take care of the kids at home, do the errands, cook food, etc. It loves women who do not try to be their own person and become independent. That’s why heaven is under mothers’ feet not womens’.\n\nThis is not actually taught in islam it doesnt say we cant leave the house or have to get married these practices are cultural also where does islam say the man can do what he wants sure islam says be obediant as a wife but that doesnt mean he can mess about not work or mistreat us even its sunnah to do housework:\n\nAisha, the wife of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), was asked, “What did the Prophet (ﷺ) use to do in his house?” She replied, “He used to keep himself busy serving his family (كَانَ يَكُونُ فِي مِهْنَةِ أَهْلِهِ) and when it was the time for prayer he would go for it.” (Bukhari)\n\nIn another report Aisha is reported to have said, “He did what one of you would do in his house. He mended sandals and patched garments and sewed.” (Adab Al-Mufrad graded sahih by Al-Albani)\n\nIn yet another report it is said that she said, “He milked his goat.” (Ahmad)\n\n“The best of you is the one who is best to his wife, and I am the best of you to my wives.” (Tirmidhi; Ibn Majah)"

    "text": ">But the point of the hadith was he had nothing left property wise after his death and was in debt:\n\nSo the slaves are property. That’s kind of the problem, having another human being as “property”.\n\n>https://islam.stackexchange.com/questions/62644/what-is-the-explanation-of-the-apparent-contradiction-on-manumission-of-slaves-i?noredirect=1&lq=1\n\nHow does this explain it? It just reaffirms the point about helping your relatives being more important than abolishing slavery. Again, that’s the problem. Restating as it is something normal doesn’t solve it.\n\n>Manumission on its own in ialam is considered a good deed and is encouraged this hadith doesnt go against that.\n\nI wasn’t arguing against that though. My point is that Islam at the very least *permits* slavery. It encourages some good things but it is not enough. Slavery isn’t something you can permit in moderation.\n\n>The prophet didnt say we are stupid or cant be intelligent as men as the testimony ruling was used as evidence for it but the quran in Surah Baqara 2:282 says two are needed if the first one makes a mistake the other can remind her but what does our witness testimony got to do with intelligence the hadith ess simply about encouraging women to give to charity to overcome these so called hurdles.\n\n“Women lack in intelligence because the Quran says the testimony of a woman is less reliable.” is what your prophets says. It doesn’t say the same for men, the prophet explicitly uses the verse support that women are less intelligent.  These so called hurdles apparently do not exist for men to this extent since Quran doesn’t bother to mention it.\n\nLacking in intellect means stupid.\n\n>Also in fiqh our court testimony can be equal if we are learnt or educated in those matters as the quran verse 2:282 was only talking about being a witness to contract of debt: Ibn al-Qayyim :\n\nThe Hadith is clear and explicit. Even if do say women can be equal if they are educated that still shows misogyny. It acts like women are inherently less intelligent and need to be educated (unlike men) to be on equal terms with them.\n\nAlso, simply linking an apologetic site and citing from them is something everyone can do. You can find scholars and interpretations that fit your views everywhere. I can do the same and link some atheist sites here that quote sexist interpretations and how it has been generally understood as. Here I can do the same:\n\nIn traditional interpretive practice, Islamic scholars rely on the maxim that \"the meaning [of scripture] is based on the generality of the wording and not the specificity of the circumstance\" (العبرة بعموم اللفظ لا بخصوص السبب).[2] The theological idea behind this practice is that since Allah tasked Muhammad with providing laws and beliefs for humankind for all eternity while still, as a human, being bound to a specific time and place, his followers would necessarily have to extrapolate his teachings which emerged in particular circumstances into future-proof, universalized formulations. Accordingly, traditional Islamic scholars agreed that if this were the case, then Muhammad would have to explicitly declare a teaching of his to be time-limited or otherwise non-generalizable in order for it not to be extrapolated into the future - otherwise there would be no way to distinguish his general proclamations from his temporal ones.\n\n>Another argument can be that the verse only referred to us being a witness to a contract of debt even then take it as face value it doesnt mean it should be applied to everything either.\n\nYou are arguing against claims no one made. The problem is that the Hadith calls women “lacking in intelligence”, that’s the problem. That’s it. Not that women are completely worthless beings that have no reliable testimonies ever.\n\nAnd even if this doesn’t prove anything, at the very least it shows terrible (and I mean terrible) communication skills from the so called prophet. Calling women less experienced in financial matters (which is a way too charitable interpretation) is whole a lot different than calling them lacking in intelligence (and religion).\n\n>Islam doesnt forbid us from working or owning our own wealth so we arent dependent on them islam just makes it obligatory for women to provide for us overall for women we can get our own wealth and be provided for on top of that.\n\nIslam *encourages* the jobless housewife tough. Obviously it doesn’t straight up forbid it but the ideal woman is described as someone who stays at home and “obeys” her husband. The ideal husband on the other hand isn’t described as that, it is almost like a kid parent relationship.\n\n>Okay and? Its not like he can force me and its not a sin if I have a legit reason\n\nNot permitting rape is not as high a bar as you think.\n\nSimply not wanting to have sex is a legit reason.\n\n>or issue plus if you keep on denying your husband sex thats just going to lead to problems  whats the point even being married then.\n\nSo you are at fault for not wanting to have sex sometimes? This is just victim blaming. Men do not choose when you can have sex, it is something both partners choose. Women are not just supposed go along with it.\n\nDo angels curse a man who refuses his wives call to sex? Never heard of a Hadith like that...\n\n>This is not actually taught in islam it doesnt say we cant leave the house or have to get married these practices are cultural also where does islam say the man can do what he wants sure islam says be obediant as a wife but that doesnt mean he can mess about not work or mistreat us even its sunnah to do housework:\n\nWhat is this proving? Again, Islam *encourages* this. It’s mindset about the ideal marriage and woman is wrong from the start. Obviously men can’t just do everything they want.\n\nPlease stop responding by saying “But Islam doesn’t do this other bad thing.”. It doesn’t matter, the point is about what it does do.\n\n>“The best of you is the one who is best to his wife, and I am the best of you to my wives.” (Tirmidhi; Ibn Majah)\n\nThe problem is what is Islam considers “good treatment” and the “ideal family”. “Be good.” is extremely vague on it’s own."

It just reaffirms the point about helping your relatives being more important than abolishing slavery. Again, that’s the problem. Restating as it is something normal doesn’t solve it.\n\n\n\nYes thats what makes them slaves but manumission was still highly encouraged especially if you want to wipe sins off.\n\nPlus islam instructs you feed them. Clothe them and not to abuse them in the hadith and dont give them tasks they cant do.\n\nThats the point it was just certain cases like with a family member struggling that its more good to give them one but even in that hadith the prophet still was okay and said it was good she freed her slave.\n\n>I wasn’t arguing against that though. My point is that Islam at the very least permits slavery. It encourages some good things but it is not enough. Slavery isn’t something you can permit in moderation.\n\nSlavery in islam sure its allowed but not encouraged it all depends on what the leader of the muslims or like rule does with captured prisoners if they could be released, ransomed or enslaved in this way islam is flexible you dont have to do slavery there is no need for it overall.\n\n>Women lack in intelligence because the Quran says the testimony of a woman is less reliable.” is what your prophets says.

Calling women less experienced in financial matters (which is a way too charitable interpretation) is whole a lot different than calling them lacking in intelligence (and religion).\n\nBut my point was our intelligence as a whole wasnt being dismissed or being compared to men the example the peophet gave was linked to our court testimony which can be made equal depending on the scholar plus being witness of a act has nothing to do with intelligence or the lack of it.\n\nThats why I said it makes more sense that the hadoth was in a hyperbolic sense as no other hadith says we are deficent in intelligence and this hadith was simply about getting those women to give to charity.\n\nThe site I linked explained the rulings and the souces where I got them from I mentioned both the scholary views they held just to dismiss it as apologetics is not a rebuttal but the point was we are not limited in being a witness in court your right it is a certain interpretation some scholars even say women in hudood cases cant be witnesses but thats not found in the quran or hadith but my point was we can legally and religiously be allowed to be equal in court and give a testimony as a women thats what matters overall.\n\nI disagree the argument here isnt that this ruling was time specified as none of the scholars I quoted used that as a defense they used their own views and interpretation that still aligned with the quran and still allowed women to be witnesses and be equal to men in this regard they used the defense of her education or her experiance in the feild instead.\n\nBut thats what the quran verse 2:282 is about being a witness to a contract of debt it doesnt say its applied in everything and in anything in that verse thats why some scholars say it was only in financial cases.\n\n>Islam encourages the jobless housewife tough. Obviously it doesn’t straight up forbid it but the ideal woman is described as someone who stays at home and “obeys” her husband. The ideal husband on the other hand isn’t described as that, it is almost like a kid parent relationship.\n\nStaying at home is not mentioned in the quran or hadith while the quran and hadith do encourage obediance but thats doesnt mean can mistreat us and stop us from working either there is a balance to as the prophet said the best of you are the best to your wives in islam there is no need for the husband to stop us from working if his doing it to control our flow of wealth then he isnt a good person or husband his not treating us well.\n\n>Not permitting rape is not as high a bar as you think.\nSimply not wanting to have sex is a legit reason.\n\nBut then there is no isdue if rape is not allowed or encouraged in the hadith then thats my point.\n\nThe issue here is if he goes to bed angry then its a sin if the wife simply says no just because he wont get mad only if she does it every time or daily then that would make sense even if its not the case it doesnt matter overall there isnt much that can happen besides a divorce or angels curse us.\n\n>So you are at fault for not wanting to have sex sometimes? This is just victim blaming. Men do not choose when you can have sex, it is something both partners choose. Women are not just supposed go along with it.\nDo angels curse a man who refuses his wives call to sex? Never heard of a Hadith like that...\n\nIt goes both ways islamically the man cant neglect us as its a sin and no hadith says that men are cursed by angels if he says no that I am aware of.\n\nIts not victim blaming one of the points of marriage is to have halal sex so you dont fall into zina (adultery or fornication) if the man or women isnt getting enough intimacy it can lead to divorce or even cheating which the later one islam is strictly against.\n\n>What is this proving? Again, Islam encourages this. It’s mindset about the ideal marriage and woman is wrong from the start. Obviously men can’t just do everything they want.\nPlease stop responding by saying “But Islam doesn’t do this other bad thing.”. It doesn’t matter, the point is about what it does do.\n\nThere is a difference between encouragement and forced I dont need to get married or be a house wife islam doesnt stop us from that its not a sin to say no to marriage or to work as a married women. Overall the mindset isnt bad for simply encouraging marrige its how people pick and choose and dont let the girl choose what she wants islam left the option open for us for a reason no one can just ignore that.\n\n>The problem is what is Islam considers “good treatment” and the “ideal family”. “Be good.” is extremely vague on it’s own.\n\nIt being left vague can make it apply in any scenerio as long as the husband is not being malicious and controlling just to torment or control us that would be seen as good treatment the hadith hasnt mentioned specific things in the hadith what counts as that so I guess it can be applied in a general sense"

    "text": "To be honest, sorry about the insults. I went a little bit overboard.\n\nThe last comment wasn’t aiming to really make an argument, I was just ranting.\n\nHowever people trying to sugarcoat slavery and misogyny really turns my gears. It’s like watching a mother trying to justify his bratty son’s actions and never yielding.\n\nI don’t want you to think this was a cop out since it would only strengthen your beliefs, so I want to make a few quick comments.\n\nInsulting you was my bad, sorry about that. However I do think nothing will change your mind. So I don’t wanna continue the debate. Only once throughout dozens of debates I’ve been in that they actually changed their mind. I do not wanna waste my time anymore which will only frustrate me anyways.\n\nBut one of your points seem to be true, the Hadith about narrowing the path of jews was said in wartime so there is a discussion to be had here whether it still holds. However I don’t think it makes a big difference since there are a lot of other things that degrade jews. This one Hadith is not a big thing. Ok just wanted to respond to that.\n\nBut before I go just wanna ask one more question:\n\nWhat is the point of reading the Quran and hadiths to learn moral truths when you will try to immediately reinterpret them when you don’t like them? And be honest, both of us know your first instinct when faced with a questionable Hadith or verse is to look for explanations rather than to think about whether these are explained better as religion being man made. Because I was like you.\n\nSo why believe in religion which’s purpose is to guide you if you will alter it when you see fit?\n\nEDIT: Your defense about jews isn’t true either since the Hadith says the same about Christians. And also Muhammad’s companions continued to do this after his death too. So this was probably something Muhammad ordered permanently after the jews really pissed him of, he might have ordered this at wartime but it persisted way after that. Even a lot of scholars (like Tabari) see jews as inferior. https://www.answering-islam.org/Shamoun/badawi_greetings.htm"

They don't break your wudu.\n\n\nIn Hanafi (46% of Muslims largest by far) dogs can be kept as pets but it's makrouh but their saliva breaks your wudu. Guard dogs, Sheppards, etc... Are not makrouh.\n\n\nIn Shafi'i (28% of Muslims) its haram and any moisture from a dog breaks wudu. That means if your hand is wet and it touches it.\n\n\nIn Hanbali it's haram. Even their breath or shedded fur breaks wudu. Hanbali is the smallest Orthodox Madhab by far <2% of Muslims.\n\n\nSpecific Sheikhs from the various Madhabs have varying views on dogs so there's some Hanafis that say dogs are Halal."
