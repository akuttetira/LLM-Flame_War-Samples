Theists are forced to make unbelievable excuses. Starvation isn't a person's fault. It's an unfortunate natural phenomena that affects all organisms regardless of \"corruption\". You can't blame EVERYTHING on \"human corruption\".\n\nThe point of this thread is to ask **how is god all-loving** if he lets these things happen. A volcano is God's creation.
