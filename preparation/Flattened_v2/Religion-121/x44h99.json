Your sloppy use of language needs to “be more precise” if you want better answers!\n\n>Go back in time, say to the time where there are some replicating molecules. At what point a population starts to exist and why?\n\n- There are lots of ways populations can diverge and separate. Geographical isolation is one of the main ones.\n\nEx: A bunch of cells are replicating in a small coastal pool and a wave comes along and washes some of them into another adjacent  pool. Now that one population was split into two pools to make two different populations by this wave. The environments in each pool could be slightly different leading to a slightly different population evolving accordingly. Now you take that new population and do it again with another wave, and now that new pool is a slightly different environment than the previous one and even more different from the original…. And on and on and on.\n\nEX: A bunch of cells are replicating through different depths in the water column, populations replicating closer to the surface will be exposed to more sunlight than ones replicating at the bottom of the ocean. That separation and divergence can just get more extreme with more time. The bottom dwellers start adapting to living in sea floor mud and the top dwellers start adapting to shallow pools on the beach or even eventually outside water.\n\nAn earthquake could split a population, a stream of lava from a volcano could split a population, the development of a new river could split a population, light and shadow could even split a population. Underground or above ground could split a populations. Underwater or above water could split a population. Do I really need to go on?\n\nEvolution is in no way lacking mundane mechanism to separate and split populations with."

It is far more useful to characterize the behavior of an animal in terms of its genetics, biology, and its behavior than the movement of electrons in its countless atoms. And more useful to characterize the changes in a large population of genetically similar organisms in terms of its evolution.\n\nWell the term emergent corresponds to magic.

Through your epiphenomenal ineffective consciousness?\n\nThese questions are also moot.  The first is already answered and the second is solipstic claptrap.\n\n>Are they more than particles surrounding them?\n\nIf you already understand \"particles\" and \"surrounding\" then you know no more is needed.\n\n>After all particles since the big bang bumped one onto other and randomly they look like cell walls. No?\n\nNo.  Your understanding of chemistry is bad and you should feel bad.\n\n>You define it.\n\nSo you can't define identity; you're just trying to use it as a gotcha term, check.\n\n>Since you say populations consisting of individual organism evolve.\n\nIf you are having trouble with the concept of individual organisms I suggest starting with a remedial kindergarten class.  They will also teach you what sounds said organisms make.\n\n>I may say if i am materialist atheist that there are just particles bumping one onto other since the bing bang amd our alleged observations about the upper layers are no more than ineffective useless illusions.\n\nNone of this follows nor holds any relevance.  This is a straw man of reductionism."

Evolution does not encompass or rest on any particular theory of identity. Stop trying to change this discussion to suit your interests. You can start a post of your own on any topic."

This theory isn’t just one definition- it comes with a body of other observations and theories that are poorly summed up if you have a one sentence definition.\n\nWhat you’re asking for is like asking what special relativity is. Someone can give you a one sentence definition, but you really won’t know what they’re talking about unless you understand all of the underlying principles and processes involved in that theory."
