It takes an Absurdist approach by putting an idea to the most logical extreme.\n\nIf kids automatically go to heaven, getting them there at any cost should be a devout Christians mission.\n\nChristians profess selflessness, so sacrificing their eternal well-being for their child is the ultimate expression of love and accomplishes the task of getting them (the child) to eternal happiness.\n\nIt's a logical conclusion that exposes a loophole into heaven.  A loophole that can't be if an omnipotent, benevolent God were to exist."

What if you’re tortured the same amount but you can save two kids?  Three? How many kids would you have to save before it’s ok for you?\n\nBecause if you would do that, that’s not fundamentally different from savings a child from hell by sending them to heaven, and going to hell yourself instead."
