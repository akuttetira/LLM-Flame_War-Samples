Do this while watching television, and you find that your dreams incorporate things that are being displayed on the television.  The subconscious mind is an amazing thing that can concoct some seemingly very real experiences and really warp one's sense of time and space.  The input functions still seem to operate on some level even during unconsciousness, which could account for the person being able to point to things that were happening in the room as s/he was unconscious or \"dead\".  This is what I tend to attribute these NDE's to.  Without strong corroborating evidence, they seem to be nothing more than very vivid imaginings of the mind."

    "text": "This is completely not true. Studies found a trace amount of DMT in rat brains AFTER death. Not a clinically significant amount; meaning no more than can ordinarily be found in the blood stream.\n\nAdditionally, there are other factors that indicate the DMT hypothesis is completely wrong:\n\n* The pineal gland is tiny and could never produce enough for even a mere euphoric feeling; it absolutely could not produce enough in mere seconds to cause a major DMT trip.\n* DMT trips last a minimum of 30 minutes; a very strong trip lasts 45+ minutes. Everyone who had an NDE, who was dead less than 45 minutes would still be tripping hardcore when they awakened. Yet this is not the case.\n\nThe DMT hypothesis was proposed by a parapsychologist, not by a scientist. The study on rats was done as a result of it, and the presence of DMT has been since touted as \"strong proof\" of this hypothesis. Yet people who support this never read the study, and never read up on rebuttals to the story.\n\nFurthermore, NDEs are reported to be entirely unlike any drug trip, even very strong ones. In fact, drug trips have very, very specific differences. The most important, major one is lucidity. The person in the NDE feels completely in control of themselves and is not dragged along on a trip. They feel like it's no different from getting up and walking into the bathroom (as example), where in a drug trip, you are taken on a journey outside of your control--and even if you get \"over it\" the drug will continue to force you along on this journey.\n\nYou don't get to just decide to be done with a drug trip. You are not fully lucid in a drug trip. You know on some level of your awareness that you are on a drug trip. When you return from a drug trip, it feels like you had a drug trip. These are radical differences from NDEs."

So yes it can be easy for us to “naturally” believe some false things\n\nSo my analogy is only that “what we’re predisposed to believe” has no relation to what is true. I’m also fine just making that statement without the analogy. *So what* if people are predisposed to belief in an afterlife? And did the study control for this being an idea they had been primed to believe, or that it could be a result of their cognitive abilities not yet having fully grasped the concept of death?"

It's one of the few instances where Pascal's Wager could actually be properly applied.

But this in no way implies they're true, nor do they need to be too most of the time. Pareidolia is a thing after all. How long was miasma theory popular.

Survival doesn't depend on afterlife. Afterlife might be a way of copping with the fact that you will die.\n\nThis is a complete misunderstanding of both of my previous replies, but that's possibly my fault for not fully explaining so I'll attempt to remedy this here.\n\nThe fight or flight adrenaline boost response that was passed down, while serving our ancestors well, has zero benefit nowadays why we're trying to give a public speech or talk to someone we're interested in. Traits aren't *beneficial* because of some direct link to anything specific.\n\nI believe I mentioned pareidolia before. There is zero benefit to our brains seeing faces in every shape that vaguely resembles a face. There **is** a benefit in being able to identify and recognize other people and animals, even if they're trying to hide in the environment. Pareidolia is just the manifestion of a beneficial trait kicked up to overdrive, high jacked into becoming a quirk. As long as that quirk doesn't become a liability, it can remain.\n\nSo we have a species that is:\n- Inclined to attribute agency to natural disturbances (ie. it's not the wind, it's a lion)\n- Has a brain that is so good at pattern recognition that it can find them even when none are present.\n\nYou take just those two traits (probably lots more), combined in developing brains starting to reach that point where we become aware of ourselves as individuals. We start having inner dialogues, which surprisingly not everyone experiences even now. Some people claim to hear voices speaking directly to them (schizophrenia in many cultures outside the US manifests as hallucinatory voices and, while 1 in 400 isn't a lot, it's not insignificant either).\n\nThe potential of god beliefs developing doesn't just seem possible, it seems almost inevitable. Rituals to appease these beings would be reinforced by the plethora of biases we're already prone to and these shared beliefs would bring groups together and, the fragile meatbags that we are, we're stronger together.\n\nAs for your specific is of afterlife beliefs, a few points. First, they're not independently developed beliefs. They're baggage drug in with religion. Near death experiences bring people talking about...this other... Whatever that means to them. Brains deprived of oxygen trying to make sense of what's happening can come up with pretty much anything, and since it's already the means by which we experience reality, whatever it comes up with can be pretty convincing. But it's always shaped by culture, as if it's a product of their experiences as opposed to some external place.\n\nAnd the belief *can* be beneficial as a form of grieving for those still living. I personally don't think it's necessary, which is backed up by the many people who don't believe in it. Even without pointing out religions that believe in reincarnation, the Jewish faith speaks of a resurrection of the dead but doesn't really delve into an afterlife.\n\n>What if we choose our lives ? Wouldn't that be something :))\n\nNo. If it were so, we're clearly not very good at it considering where people are born and what some endure and we obviously can't communicate any of it to ourselves, so no. It seems even if we do, it's indistinguishable from an existence where we don't."

    "text": ">I think all cultures believe in a form of an after-life.\n\nOnly if you're choosing a usage of *belief* that encompasses quite literally any thought that something happens after death.  I wouldn't consider, for instance, reincarnation to fall under an afterlife classification since it's less 'sequel' and more 'new movie'.\n\nBut let's set that aside and just look at those afterlives that we would agree on.  While I wouldn't claim that every belief in an afterlife is tied to a religion as I'm sure somewhere, somebody came up with a concept of an afterlife all on their own...and by \\*on their own\\* I mean likely with the assistance of mind altering aids.   But I've never heard a Christian talking about wondering how much a trip across the river Styx will cost.  If you can say a religion and immediately have a general concept of the core aspects of the afterlife they believe in, a claim that you don't believe it's tied to religion comes across as willful ignorance.  And I'm sorry if that sounds insulting;  I genuinely spent several minutes trying to think of a polite way to phrase that, but how could claim the two aren't intrinsically linked?\n\nUltimately though, the point is moot.  A being aware of it's own mortality ponders on what comes after is hardly a shocking notion.  It seems more like a guarantee, and considering the vast varieties of versions that people have come up, fabricating these ideas does indeed appear to be inevitable.  It's the fact that none of them can agree on any significant details that should give you pause and make you wonder if, maybe they're all raised to believe something that they have no good reason to."

The Bible is full of errors and inaccurate representations of reality. Believers can hand wave them away as allegory, but they can't explain their criteria for deciding what's literal and what's not. If it comes down to the literal becoming figurative once it's shown to not be true then its pretty poor foundation for belief."

If so, aren't you being at least a little hypocritical by telling others not to insult people whilst insulting people yourself?\n\nRegarding \"[learning] to give the f*ck up\", when do you think someone should do so?

    "text": "The real issue is whether there is evidence of the supernatural realm. Such evidence of course is never going to appear as empirical to a person who holds solely to the scientific method.\n\n\n\nThere is tons of research on how chemical reactions “supposedly” cause these NDEs.  As u/firethorne stated; “I have a bit of trouble with evidence no one else in the room can verify, especially when the claimant’s brain is possibly on pain medications, being deprived of oxygen, when all sorts of things are going wrong in their body, and the vast majority of such people aren't even conscious. This is when you get the best possible evidence? When it is least reliable? When events are subject to explanations of cerebral hypoxia, anoxia, and hypercarbia; endorphins and other neurotransmitters; and abnormal activity in the temporal lobes?”\n\n\n\nTo me such statements seem irrelevant since we can’t read each other’s minds even when we are conscious. It is a totally materialistic view of life being simply the functional workings of a biological organism. Therefore we cannot achieve a consensus of when life begins and thus goes the abortion debate.\n\n\n\nBut suppose for just a moment that the soul, spirit, consciousness or whatever you wish to title it, is in fact in control and that the chemical reactions being seen are the result of this soul, spirit or consciousness expressing its control to achieve a bodily response. Here is where we would enter into what would be considered voluntary and involuntary chemical reactions. What is to be considered voluntary? It seems that the bulk of our actions are voluntary when we are consciously awake. If I wish to close my eyes I do so voluntarily and yet a whole chain of chemical reactions are required to achieve this simple action. My heart beats involuntarily and again a whole series of chemical reactions are required. Does this mean then that some chemicals are subject to our control while others are actually controlling us? If so then certain chemicals are using reason and must be entities in their own respect.\n\n\n\nPerhaps there should be a separate distinction made between what is called NDEs and out of body experiences. An OOBE could well occur while a person is asleep and be interpreted as a dream. Near death appears to only apply while being medically treated or observed, otherwise there could be no “near death” determination made.\n\n\n\nSo to answer your question, “do you believe in a Beforelife?”, I can only say that I believe life is eternal and therefore there can be no before or after implied from a spiritual viewpoint. Biologically speaking my before life would be my biological parents, from which came the sperm and the egg, and who came from my grandparents, great grandparents, etc., etc.\n\n\n\nIf your view of life is that it is all biological chemical reactions then it should be a simple thing to inject some DNA into a rock and create a new lifeform. Our efforts at advancing AI would have no reason to call it intelligence if it is not based on an artificial replica of intelligent design. What is artificial?"

Thus my comment that \"before life' and \"afterlife' are oxymoronic expressions.\n\nBy applying this logic the lifeforce would pass from one dwelling place (body) to the next. The recollection of time spent in each dwelling place can only be described as memories. Recorded history is therefore nothing more than recorded memories. Until it becomes possible, if it ever should, that we can tap into \"all\" the unrecorded memories of all whom have dwelt upon this earth we will not have the complete record of earth's life history. Perhaps all these memories have been retained somewhere, in someway and for a yet unknown purpose.\n\nThis is, for me at least, the great mystery in that I cannot conceive of life as something that dies. Otherwise it would not be life. By the same token I cannot conceive of death as beginning and thus forcing the end of a life. To try is to believe that would require also that death would then be eternal. I don't believe that anyone can envision a spirit dying but rather only a material body ceasing its functions. It seems obvious than that life and death cannot cohabitate so the question is; \"Which is the dominant force?\" if you even admit to death being a force.\n\nI welcome any thoughts on this."

If they weren't the ones who were surprised and shocked by the statements of their near-death patients, no one would think twice about them.

We could also ask how is it that they so consistently understand that they are near death or dying?  Many of these accidents happen faster than they have time to understand what's going on and they're often drugged and out of it.

We'll have patients hooked up to increasingly sensitive instrumentation, we'll be able to confirm the absence of brain activity, we'll have video and audio of operations, everything will be recorded, etc.  People die every day, we should be able to confirm weird stuff is going on if it's actually happening.\n\n>All in all, at this stage, I think the differences are as important as the similarities.\n\nYou're absolutely right.

This is just the out-of-body portion.\n\n>A common characteristic of near-death experiences is an out-of-body experience. An out-of-body experience (OBE) is the apparent separation of consciousness from the body. About 45% of near-death experiencers report OBEs which involves them seeing and often hearing ongoing earthly events from a perspective that is apart, and usually above, their physical bodies. Following cardiac arrest, NDErs may see, and later accurately describe, their own resuscitation.\n\n>The first prospective study of the accuracy of out-of-body observations during near-death experiences was by Dr. Michael Sabom.8 This study investigated a group of patients who had cardiac arrests with NDEs that included OBEs, and compared them with a control group of patients who experienced cardiac crises but did not have NDEs. Both groups of patients were asked to describe their own resuscitation as best they could. Sabom found that the group of NDE patients were much more accurate than the control group in describing their own resuscitations.\n\n>Another prospective study of out-of-body observations during near-death experiences with similar methodology to Sabom’s study was published by Dr. Penny Sartori.9 This study also found that near-death experiencers were often remarkably accurate in describing details of their own resuscitations. The control group that did not have NDEs was highly inaccurate and often could only guess at what occurred during their resuscitations.\n\n>Two large retrospective studies investigated the accuracy of out-of-body observations during near-death experiences. The first was by Dr. Janice Holden.10 Dr. Holden reviewed NDEs with OBEs in all previously published scholarly articles and books, and found 89 case reports. Of the case reports reviewed, 92% were considered to be completely accurate with no inaccuracy whatsoever when the OBE observations were later investigated."

You're not normally monitoring people's brain activity.  However there is one [case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pam_Reynolds_case) that is \"confirmed\" in this exact sense.  And while having many of these confirmed cases would provide concrete proof, the fact that this doesn't often happen to people who are much, much less close to death is telling.  Why is this associated more closely with people near death than just passed out?"

    "text": "> The difference is that much of what people believe about religion before dying is corroborated by the experience of death. These experiences very obviously confirm religious beliefs about death.\n\nSo if there was a religion that thought the world of dreams existed as a distinct place, you would count the experience that we dream as confirming that religious belief about dreams? Rather than the reverse, that the experience we have dreaming (or being close to death, respectively) informing our religious beliefs? Because while Near Death Experiences have become more common with advances in medicine, there is 1) no reason to think they *never* occured before and 2) can be similar to the effects of various drugs we know people have been using for a very long time.\n\nThe only difference between \"near death experiences are evidence in favor of a past-death world\" and \"dream experiences are evidence in favor of a dream world\" is that the former aligns with certain religious views you might share or that are at least common in your culture.\n\n>  It's just you would think their physical sensations should be similar - white light, euphoria, etc. but not necessarily anything else.\n\nAs well as things like out of body sensations, the presence of loved ones, etc etc. The things that we would imagine be clearly distinct would be things like language. And if you find me a few examples of people from places who's never had contact with Christianity or Judaism and they all have NDE's featuring clear writing in Hebrew, yeah, that would give me pause.\n\n> You would need to confirm the patient is brain-dead at the time the activities that they report witnessing took place.\n\nNot exactly, that's a different matter. Mind-body dualism could in theory be correct without implying out of body experiences are actual displacements of the mind and sensory ability.\n\n>  You're not normally monitoring people's brain activity. However there is one case that is \"confirmed\" in this exact sense.\n\nNo, it isn't. We have no evidence that her experiences occured during the time of brain death, and well, it doesn't match your claim above that \"it's the highly educated doctors and nurses who are the ones corroborating these accounts\"; the actual expert who investigated the case - the anaesthesiologist - came to the conclusion that the perception occured during anaesthesia, not brain death.\n\nAnd well, this might be kind of a nitpicky sidenote, but even the reynolds case doesn't make any real claims about perceptions outside of what could be observed from the point of view of the body. That is to say, even *if* it had been the case that she could observe things while braindead (which there is no good evidence to suggest she did), it would not be evidence of out of body sensations being a displacement of the mind and sensory capabilities; it would \" only\" be evidence of mind-body dualism (though to be clear, that would still be massive)."

Of course alternative explanations exist.\n\n>As well as things like out of body sensations, the presence of loved ones, etc etc.\n\nThe commonality that I've heard of is the presence of *deceased* loved ones.

I understand what the \"expert\" believes - I don't think you need to be particularly well educated to come up with that explanation.  He wouldn't be there in the first place if the doctors and nurses didn't find anything strange about what happened.  That's what is unique about these experiences.  No one would care if it wasn't the *witnesses* to the surgery claiming something strange was happening."

We looked into it and decided bigfoot doesn't exist.  We're at the tip of the iceberg in regards to NDEs.  You're making a spurious claim when you say the out-of-body element of NDEs has been \"debunked\".\n\nFrom that [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6172100/):\n\n>A common characteristic of near-death experiences is an out-of-body experience. An out-of-body experience (OBE) is the apparent separation of consciousness from the body. About 45% of near-death experiencers report OBEs which involves them seeing and often hearing ongoing earthly events from a perspective that is apart, and usually above, their physical bodies. Following cardiac arrest, NDErs may see, and later accurately describe, their own resuscitation.\n\n>The first prospective study of the accuracy of out-of-body observations during near-death experiences was by Dr. Michael Sabom. This study investigated a group of patients who had cardiac arrests with NDEs that included OBEs, and compared them with a control group of patients who experienced cardiac crises but did not have NDEs. Both groups of patients were asked to describe their own resuscitation as best they could. Sabom found that the group of NDE patients were much more accurate than the control group in describing their own resuscitations.\n\n>Another prospective study of out-of-body observations during near-death experiences with similar methodology to Sabom’s study was published by Dr. Penny Sartori. This study also found that near-death experiencers were often remarkably accurate in describing details of their own resuscitations. The control group that did not have NDEs was highly inaccurate and often could only guess at what occurred during their resuscitations.\n\n>Two large retrospective studies investigated the accuracy of out-of-body observations during near-death experiences. The first was by Dr. Janice Holden. Dr. Holden reviewed NDEs with OBEs in all previously published scholarly articles and books, and found 89 case reports. Of the case reports reviewed, 92% were considered to be completely accurate with no inaccuracy whatsoever when the OBE observations were later investigated."

In fact, there is a surprising amount of cross-cultural consistency amongst them.\n\nIn terms of the archetypal figures that are encountered in an NDE yes, and obviously there is greater consistency within a community. But when you zoom out and start comparing community against community rather than just individuals within a community, you start to see much more conflict.\n\nCould this be due to the cultural differences between communities? It seems much more likely than just accepting that anyone's NDE is equally as accurate in describing an actual afterlife as anyone else's.\n\n>And, while there is certainly individual variation, a striking order and pattern emerges that is not something taught in any particular religious tradition.\n\nI have already addressed this by referring to the archetypal nature of many of the \"entities\" that people encounter in NDEs, but perhaps it might help you to learn what cross-cultural archetypes are. You could start by learning about Carl Jung's archetypal framework or Joseph Campbell's monomyth/hero's journey framework.\n\n>When I first took an interest in NDEs I was expecting something like what you described, or perhaps a very confused body of imagery as various as peoples dreams, but when I actually started reading them, especially the early ones (especially the early ones, before NDE accounts became a known genre), I was struck by the unique, clear, and consistent pattern that emerged.\n\nAgain, this is something that Carl Jung dedicated much of his life to the study of. It is not evidence of an afterlife. It suggests that the human brain tends to seek a particular narrative pattern in its environment. This is influenced heavily by an individual's cultural context, which often include their religious background."

    "text": ">I'm using these points as evidnece against any of them being conclusive evidnece of one religion's version of an afterlife being correct over any of the others'.\n\nDude, it doesn't matter what some followers of Christianity claim. Nowhere in Abrahamic faiths are NDE's a thing. And nowhere do any Abrahamic scriptures or scholars of these faiths claim to use these experiences as evidence of afterlife. It's mostly fraud shows on the internet that can sell(as you correctly mention) with fake testimonies. Afterlife doesn't begin until you actually die and become resurrected. As far as other religions/God's, in Islamic ahadeeth it is mentioned there will be objects/figures representing God's of other religions on judgement day and God will tell people to go to their God's and a group of people on that day will, each one going to hell. Muslims are mentioned on that day staying put and waiting for Allah. And Allah comes to them but they don't recognize him until he makes it known it is him. So, even on Judgement day, people will see what they used to follow according to Islam. And it is not an argument against the existence of the Abrahamic God:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>We said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?\" He said, \"Do you have any difficulty in seeing the sun and the moon when the sky is clear?\" We said, \"No.\" He said, \"So you will have no difficulty in seeing your Lord on that Day as you have no difficulty in seeing the sun and the moon (in a clear sky).\" The Prophet then said, \"Somebody will then announce, 'Let every nation follow what they used to worship.' So the companions of the cross will go with their cross, and the idolators (will go) with their idols, and the companions of every god (false deities) (will go) with their god, till there remain those who used to worship Allah, both the obedient ones and the mischievous ones, and some of the people of the Scripture. Then Hell will be presented to them as if it were a mirage. Then it will be said to the Jews, \"What did you use to worship?' They will reply, 'We used to worship Ezra, the son of Allah.' It will be said to them, 'You are liars, for Allah has neither a wife nor a son. What do you want (now)?' They will reply, 'We want You to provide us with water.' Then it will be said to them 'Drink,' and they will fall down in Hell (instead). Then it will be said to the Christians, 'What did you use to worship?'\n>\n>They will reply, 'We used to worship Messiah, the son of Allah.' It will be said, 'You are liars, for Allah has neither a wife nor a son. What: do you want (now)?' They will say, 'We want You to provide us with water.' It will be said to them, 'Drink,' and they will fall down in Hell (instead). When there remain only those who used to worship Allah (Alone), both the obedient ones and the mischievous ones, it will be said to them, 'What keeps you here when all the people have gone?' They will say, 'We parted with them (in the world) when we were in greater need of them than we are today, we heard the call of one proclaiming, 'Let every nation follow what they used to worship,' and now we are waiting for our Lord.' Then the Almighty will come to them in a shape other than the one which they saw the first time, and He will say, 'I am your Lord,' and they will say, 'You are not our Lord.' And none will speak: to Him then but the Prophets, and then it will be said to them, 'Do you know any sign by which you can recognize Him?' They will say. 'The Shin,' and so Allah will then uncover His Shin whereupon every believer will prostrate before Him and there will remain those who used to prostrate before Him just for showing off and for gaining good reputation. These people will try to prostrate but their backs will be rigid like one piece of a wood (and they will not be able to prostrate)."

And you see the earth lifeless, but as soon as We send down rain upon it, it begins to stir ˹to life˺ and swell, producing every type of pleasant plant.\n\nQuran 22:5\n\nGod gives signs by comparing the resurrection or re-creation to a dead land that when the rain fall on it it came back to life, of course those signs of God can't be understood if one is a transgressor and only the people of understanding would reflect on them and know their real meaning, it's up to God to guide whoever he wills to the right path.\n\n\nAs for the near death experience, we don't have enough data I'm the Quran to say defenitely if it's real or not."

    "text": ">I think you are confused on what is proof and what is evidence.\n\nEVIDENCE\n\nˈɛvɪd(ə)ns\n\nverb\n\n-be or show evidence of.\n\nnoun\n\n- the available body of facts or information indicating whether a belief or proposition is true or valid.\n\n- information drawn from personal testimony, a document, or a material object, used to establish facts in a legal investigation or admissible as testimony in a law court.\n\n- signs or indications of something.\n\nPROOF\n\npruːf\n\nnoun\n\n- evidence or argument establishing a fact or the truth of a statement.\n\n- the action of establishing the truth of a statement.\n\n- - - - -\n\nCan you see the difference?\n\nIndividual articles of evidence build up to tip us in favour of believing something is likely or unlikely to be true. There are different degrees of strength that evidence falls under too. Anecdotes are the weakest form of evidence.\n\nProof is what we call a body of evidence so compelling that there is most likely no other explanation for a claim.\n\n*NDEs are not proof of an afterlife.*\n\nWhat they are proof of is that people have experiences of the mind that tend to bear similarities between individuals during times of near death, but this DOES NOT prove the existence of an afterlife. The actual existence of the afterlife is an entirely different claim that we cannot falsify, and therefore have no need to believe is true.\n\n>Honestly, who cares if you are convinced?\n\nPerhaps you do? Why else continue trying to argue with me, despite the poor quality of evidence to back you up?\n\n>Most of the cases involve people who had no financial gain from relaying their story,\n\nThat's a big maybe. I don't really buy that, though. People get paid by documentary companies to share their testimonies.and even if people aren't getting paid in money, there are other reasons to tell an NDE story. It gets to notoriety, influence, and clout within certain social groups. That is absolutely motivation to fabricate and enhance a story.\n\n>and many have no (as typically understood) religious connotations,\n\nAnd most do. Besides, I already mentioned this. Non-religious people still claim to have similar experiences largely because they are taught what to expect by their culture, be it through TV, movies, personal relationships or otherwise. We are taught what to expect, and the subconscious mind holds on to that kind of thing. It's the same thing that influences or dream life. Nothing magical/supernatural there.\n\n>with the exception of a \"higher power\" and their own personal judgement.\n\nRight, but \"feeling\" like there is a higher power present doesn't mean that there actually is.\n\nWhen you dream about your dead ancestors, does that mean they were literally in your brain?\n\nNo.\n\nWhen a schizophrenic sees the devil standing in the middle of their hallway, is it really there?\n\nNo.\n\nIs personal judgement a reliable method of reaching objective truth?\n\nNo.\n\nThis is why we have the scientific method. Personal experiences and anecdotes only go so far, but our senses cannot be trusted as tools of gathering undeniable truth about the world. We have known this for centuries now."

    "text": "Laws of the universe operate differently on different scale, thats why quantum physics is a thing. The physics of very small stuff. Scientist who study on the quantum level will tell you you can't 'understand' quantum physics so don't try. We know things exist on a small scale but we do not have the means to understand it, that is modern science.\n\nEven someone who does understand will have a very hard time explaining it to someone else not of the same brains. If they did that person would say \"Thats impossible\" basing their judgment on the rules of the physical realty we live in. Lets take death for example from the point of view of life as we live it. In this model there is nothing after death, but what is interesting to me is \"nothing\" is a idea that can only exist in a human mind and science itself proved many years ago there is no such thing as true \"nothing\".\n\nThe only real question is then \"what\" is there after death but again, its kind of like asking a question to something that doesn't have an answer because its not about questions and answers. An answer would be of this physical world and be inaccurate. These ideals along with my experience and billions of others there is no other way for it to be in my eyes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, people having near identical experiences through all\nof history up to modern day is evidence that something is connected, just because we don't know exactly what to the exact atom, doesn't mean its not something to be taken seriously."
