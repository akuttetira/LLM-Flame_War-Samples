You are not a good person. Your definition of good is what culture calls good. Go beyond your culture. To be good is to be self less. To be self less is to love God. Just focus on that and don’t worry about going to hell."

Thats the big difference here.\n\nTo be extra, she also knows I'm not a bad person, the only difference between our lifestyles is she worships God and i do not.\nSo its baffling she thinks I deserve hell.\n\nReligion did this to my mother!"

Who decided your mother was good and you are bad? However, from an Islamic perspective you could be identical in all action but belief in God and your mother would be a better person because of it.\n\nWhy? Because God, and in the case of Islamic understanding, the all powerful and all knowing, literally said so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>So its baffling she thinks I deserve hell.\n\nIts not really. If she is a Muslim and believes in the Quran as the revelation of God then its not hard to infer that if one disobeys God then he or she is deserving of Hellfire because again God said so."

You can’t.\n\nGod exists like good exists.\n\nShe does not think you are good because only God is good. And only through God can man be good.\n\nAnd only God knows the heart of man."

If we use what we might call a secular scale of goodness, chances are we're both pretty good people...although it seems to me you might struggle with anger problems, but that's not uncommon."
