Misogynistic is just an adjective that means \"not fair to my female group\" essentially.\n\nI don't even think you can argue that the Bible is *not* misogynistic."

    "text": "You stated that the Bible is indeed misogynistic, and now you're asking why it's frightening that Christians continue to believe and accept it?\n\nThis book is also homophobic, condones slavery (even giving instructions on how to buy and punish slaves), God himself commanded genocide and war crimes, and you're asking why it's scary that Christians consider it God's holy word?  Really?\n\nContext...such a typical excuse."

    "author": "PennTex1988",
    "text": "\"Context...such a typical excuse.\"\n\nYet, without context words are meaningless. Jesus never once gave instruction for how to buy or punish slaves, commit genocide or anything of the sort.  And, war crimes?  Really?  I was unaware of the international Bronze Age code for conducting warfare and how POW's and civilians are to be treated.  Please enlighten me.\n\nThe problem with your interpretation, and all revisionist history for that matter is a complex one.\n\nYou cant sit on your computer or smart phone and view Anthropological subjects from millennia ago through the lens of 21st century progressivism.  All you do is turn everything into a philosophical debate about current vs past societies morality.\n\nAlso, when you do this, you fail to place the people and events into their correct context and you delude people with your false conclusions because of it. Its the univalent of fake news, or propaganda.\n\nIf we are going to debate an issue, we first have to agree what it is we are debating.  We have to create some kind of framework for discussion, statements, and rebuttal.\n\nAre we debating religion, morality, philosophy, historical events or what?  Your whole argument is basically this: \"The Bible is bad because I think it is misogynistic, violent, homophobic, and evil. Only I get to interpret the meanings of those words and how they get to be implied with no context\"\n\nThe Bible is Misogynistic.\n\nThe Bible is not homophobic (look up the definition of homophobic, it does not mean if it hurts your feelings its homophobic)  The Bible is not afraid of homosexuals, I promise you.\n\nThe Bible is not pro slavery, just the opposite.\n\nThe problem with dumbasses like you who try and debate religion with their own crusader agenda is this:\n\nYou have not even read the Bible, you don't understand the culture, context or interpretation of scripture, the original languages the texts where pend in, or the culture of the authors who penned it.  Basically, you do not know shit.\n\nYou cherry pick verses that have nothing to do with Moral law, and you try to compare actual Moral, ceremonial and judicial biblical law to the world in 2021.\n\nYour frightened by Christians?  Why?  Are you frightened because they believe in the power of prayer? Because they are compassionate and have done more outreach and aide work in the last 200 years than any other religion?  Is it the belief in forgiveness, being kind to your neighbor, slow to anger and abounding in love that scares you?  Is it the nuclear family values that have you shaking in your boots?  The respect for life and the belief that we are all created in the image of God and that we should not look down on others?\n\nNo, your not scared of Christians, you just hate the God of the bible and you hate Christ because He stands for everything that you don't stand for.\n\n\"You will know them by their fruits...\"\n\n\" not everyone who says Lord, Lord, will enter the Kingdom...\"\n\nNobody who is owning or punishing slaves, committing genocide, or war crimes is a Christian."

Just wait till it's revealed that there are consequences for doing these. God said disobeying your parents decreases how long you live. He can still give you more years in the future. But without interacting with God, there are physical consequences that harm your body, mind, and spirit. (For sinning)"
