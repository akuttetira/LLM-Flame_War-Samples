What matters is that it lets the atheist avoid considering one option at all costs:\n\nThat it might be real."

    "text": "Yeah it is admittedly hostile phrasing. I hope my edit better elucidates why I feel that hostility is warranted. But the original commenter has grossly misinterpreted me, as I tried to explain in my reply to them. I don’t think religious people are all idiots or people who are mentally ill. But I do think addicts, who are in some way mentally ill in the sense of their addiction, are targeted and taken advantage of. Considering most religions want you to give them money, you can see why I have a problem with peddling a cure that you can’t offer. Really anything that takes advantage of people at their lowest I find distasteful. It’s just that this sub is debate religion."

    "text": "It's standard atheist stuff.\n\nIt's not surprising - it's just a way of avoiding even considering some possibilities.\n\nWhat *is* surprising is how many atheists fall for it.\n\nTake *The God Delusion* for example. The premise of the book is ludicrous: 85% of the world's population is mentally ill with an invisible psychiatric disorder unknown to science which can only be diagnosed by one small group of special, gifted people. The author just happens to be part of that group and by an astonishing coincidence they're the only group that believes this mental illnesses exists - and membership of their group is the cure.\n\nIt's amazing that anyone would fall for something so obviously idiotic. But they do, because it gives them a defense against considering possibilities they can't accept.\n\nAtheism is a valid position - but just like religion we have to accept that it could be wrong."

I don’t think any of that about my family or my past self. I’m just denying the miracle claims religions sometimes make as it’s offering false hope and taking advantage of addicts. I find the behavior just as bad as taking people who can’t walk, yanking them out of their wheelchairs, and saying god made them walk, as some mega churches are wont to do."

You discounted other people's lived experience and said that not only are they wrong about their own lives, they're actually ill.\n\nHave the balls to take responsibility for your own words. Don't deliberately insult a load of people then whine that you got told you're being insulting."
