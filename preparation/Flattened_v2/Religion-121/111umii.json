Also even if the vast majority of scientists and historians were Muslim that wouldn't change a thing about my beliefs, It's not about me being smarter, but it's a known fact that smart people can believe very silly things. The smartest people alive used to think the earth was the center of universe, now we know that was an extremely silly belief. So try to think for yourself.\n\nThe Quran is still clearly wrong."

U think scientists are quoting the bible and saying there are scientific miracles in the bible or torah or bagi gati or any ancient scripture that came from people with little knowledge? Show me a vid of scientists and these are athiest and Christian and one hindu scientists quoting the quran and show me a book quoted by scientists any of the thousand year old books amd it has to be preserved like the quran showing scientific miracles or predictions of the future like pharoah of moses king ramses iis body being preserved til the end of time just like the quran states 1500 years ago. Clearly the quran is from God. Ur just a goofy who hates muslims apparently noone would take time out of their day to bring falsehood to the quran literally all these points have been refuted^ the islamic scholars 1000 years ago were the first to say the earth was spherical because the quran made that apparent😂😭 yall are so lost lmao its sad"

Quran and Muslims aren't special in this.\n\nChristians also say Bible has scientific miracles. https://youtu.be/t2sMJMXDiH4\n\nAnd Hindus also say their scriptures have scientific miracles and fulfilled prophecies. https://youtu.be/YRieaQhNFu4\n\n>scientific miracles or predictions of the future like pharoah of moses king ramses\n\nHow about you take like 2 minutes before blindly regurgitating so called \"miracles\" like this one and actually look up replies to it that refute it, or can you not do any research at all?\n\n>Ur just a goofy who hates muslims apparently noone would take time out of their day to bring falsehood to the quran literally all these points have been refuted\n\nWhat is this logic?\nCriticising Islam = \"You hate Muslims\"??\nno dummy I don't hate Muslims, most of my friends are Muslims. Actually I feel bad for most of you because you have been deceived since birth to believe all of this. You're literally wasting your precious life away over fiction.\n\n>the islamic scholars 1000 years ago were the first to say the earth was spherical\n\nThis is by far one of the most idiotic statements I've ever heard, the Greek knew the earth was spherical over 2000 years ago and no, early Muslims didn't believe the earth was spherical, early scholars thought it was flat. Again, do some research before saying some dumb shit.\n\n>yall are so lost lmao its sad\n\nAre those who are lost, people who waste their lives In hopes they will enter a fictional heaven or those who are aware of the reality that there's no afterlife therefore we must make this one life the best it can possibly be? Have some self reflection bro."

You say these muslims are brainwashed and than say ur cool with them😂😭 u sound dumb fr I suggest u do more research and prove the claims I just searched up if the greeks knew the earth was spherical and what they said was that the earth was round😂😭 they looked at the sun and moon and said okay we live on a flat disc. Islamic lifestyle is the best and will help us live longer no pork no alcohol no drugs no STDs stromg family amd marital values and a positive outlook on life. There is no way in hell u believe athiesm can be proven😂😭 cant even argue with someone this stupid how did something come from nothing, theory of causality, theory of relativity? From Einstein all made up?"

    "text": "Let me teach you little lesson my friend so maybe you can benefit something from this conversation. For a verse to be considered a scientific miracle it has to meet 3 very important criterias, which are:\n\n1. The Knowledge didn't exist\n2. There’s no possible alternative meaning\n3. The statements are scientifically accurate\n\nThere's no scientific miracle claim in the Quran that meets all 3 criterias. For example, let's look at the first video you sent, again if you just did a little bit of research you'd learn that:\n\n1. Pulsars don't make sound. They emit waves in the EM spectrum, so the statement is scientifically inaccurate.\n2. The word *tariq* (the knocker) as another name for a star was in usage long before Islam. There's a pre-Islamic poem by a pagan priestess called Al Zabraa that uses that term, therefore it's not something unique to the Quran.\n\nDone.. it's not a miracle.\n\nAnd about the second video, again if you actually read my comment you'd understand that these scientists are not dumb but what they believe in is very silly, **smart people can believe silly things**. It's normal. Why? Because they're smart enough to rationalise silly ideas in their head to be able to convince themselves.\n\nWhat's so funny about this is that nowadays prominent Muslim scholars advice Muslims to stop using the scientific miracles arguments because they know it does more harm to Islam than good, if you start treating the Quran as a scientific book you'll run into so many problems. So Islamic Scholars stopped using these silly arguments years ago, but hilariously some Muslims still use it like yourself."

Other than fuel what invention made in arabian penisula which people follow islam. If u go india or even egypt u may see architectural buildings which sciemce world even idnt get proper answer in this time. And those are before islam came. Ok if u say before also islam was there , then why last messenger arabian peninsula dont have anything even no eveidence for prooving 1400 years back things and not even anything on rock or anywhere  . Beleif is ok but u have to think by urself why amd what i should. No one know whether god is there or not. So u are the only one to find truth other than blindly beleiving any religion. As per ur beleif saudi is against quran which they send first women outside space. Actually what findings or what to study in that. Did u point out any dcientist saying following quran for science.if u follow quran way of life then life will be afgan or saudi.why god only want humans dont need of other creatures?Now u can see the peoples are debating muslim scholars with solid proof amd they are wordless  ."
