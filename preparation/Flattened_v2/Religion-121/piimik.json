You need someone (priest) to explain it to you!\"\n-\"that's out of context\"\n-\"that's a metaphor, not literal\"\n-\"this contradiction is not important\"\n-\"well that's just a scribal error\"\n-\"no archaeological evidence of the exodus exists because God destroyed all the evidence\".\n-\"where in the Bible does it say the earth is flat? Oh that's just bs\"\n\nThe list of copes by the Bible believers are endless. These people have been indoctrinated since they were kids, if they don't seek out the truth by themselves, and believe the religion they have been born into just happens to be the right one out of sheer luck... Then they will never find the truth."

There was a Jewish community in Eygpt, Sodom and Gomorrah are believed to have been found, etc. But doesn't make claims of the divine real\n\nBut also, this is a debate sub and it seems your mind is closed. It is one thing to debate a subject with an open mind and another to close your mind and attack people. I see it with Theists all the time, and as Atheists we should hold ourselves to the same standards. If your mind cannot be changed on a subject then you are there to soapbox/sermonise not debate\n\ne.g. I don't believe god is real. But if someone were to provide a compelling argument or proof which refutes my views then I will change them"
