    "text": ">A supernatural explanation should only be accepted when the supernatural has been proven to exist\n\nTechnically the supernatural has been proven to exist (or at least to have existed at times, and likely to still exist). According to my dictionary, supernatural means things beyond scientific understanding. Scientific understanding is something that grows with time. So there must be things that are beyond it for a time for it to grow. When something is without scientific explanation, it is (at least for a time) technically supernatural. So basically you're alleging nothing beyond scientific understanding has been proven to exist... which is quite a lot like claiming, 'It hasn't been proven that I don't know and understand everything.'\n\n>The supernatural is anything that is not natural nor bound to natural laws such as physics, an example of this would be ghosts, specters, demons.\n\nGhosts could be bound by laws of physics for all we know. We don't know of ghosts objectively at the moment, but there are a lot of things we probably don't know at the moment (undiscovered subatomic particles, etc.) that nonetheless could be bound by laws of physics for all we know.\n\nSetting aside for a moment your claim that 'ghosts' are not bound by laws of physics, though, this definition of supernatural you’re proposing doesn't make practical sense to me as a definition in the first place because if it is something we don't understand, then there is no way to know whether or not it is bound to this law or that. So basically this definition you've proposed we use makes the word mean something that is impossible to point at and say, \"there it is,\" even if we saw it. The whole point of definitions is defining words such that we can recognize what they refer to.\n\n\nSo I think the more straightforward definition, which is actually what my (at least) dictionary says, is more useful: things beyond scientific understanding. Basically all you’ve done is re-define the word supernatural as something that cannot be shown to exist and then pointed out that means it cannot be proven to exist. Certainly people often use the word to refer to things they attribute to things they might claim are impossible to ever understand... but that's not actually what the word means, technically. That's a step beyond what the word itself means.\n\n>if the supernatural can interact with the physical world it can be detected.\n\nNot necessarily true. There have been things that interacted with the physical world that were not detected by people at the time, that people at that time could not detect (as they didn't yet have the means). For example gravitational waves and many other things. So then it is possible things are interacting with the physical world even now that we are not detecting.\n\nAlso, just because one person has 'detected' (or experienced) something doesn't mean all others can. For example if an alien being came to some small group of people and evidenced itself, along with supernatural things (by which I mean things beyond the peoples' scientific understanding), and then left, that wouldn't necessarily mean everyone in the world can detect and experience the being at their own will whenever they want. A being more advanced than us could make itself evident to some and not others if it wanted to.\n\n>Personal experiences. Hearsay is hearsay and idc about it\n\nNor should you. If you have no reason to believe in a God (or anything else)... don't. You have no reason to assume someone elses' experiences are real simply because they have been convinced they are. What's good for the goose is good for the gander though. In other words, they also have no reason to deny their experiences simply because you haven't had them."

Lighting was never actually supernatural, even back when people made up supernatural explanations for it.\n\n>Also, just because one person has 'detected' (or experienced) something doesn't mean all others can.\n\nRepeatability is a necessary condition for making a scientific (real) claim.\n\n>In other words, they also have no reason to deny their experiences simply because you haven't had them.\n\nNor do they have any rational basis to believe that a supernatural being is involved. It's safe to say that they simply had a mental illness."

According to my dictionary it means things beyond scientific understanding. You’re proposing instead that we define it as things incapable of being understood by science, a definition that doesn't make practical sense because if it is something we don't understand at the moment, then there is no way to know whether it is beyond every being understood (incapable of being understood) or not. Basically this definition you've proposed we use makes the word mean something that is impossible to point at and say, \"there it is,\" even if we saw it.

That's a step beyond what the word itself means… if we use my dictionary’s more practically useful and sensible definition.\n\n> Repeatability is a necessary condition for making a scientific (real) claim.\n\nI didn’t say an experience that proved something to someone (but which they can’t repeat because they didn’t control it) means they can “claim” it. Theism is when someone ‘believes’ God exists. Not all theists “claim” God exists. A claim is something asserted by one person to another, typically followed up with proof. A belief is something believed by a person. It is entirely possible someone or some group may reasonably come to believe they had an experience even if  they cannot prove *to you* that they did.\n\n> Nor do they have any rational basis to believe that a supernatural being is involved.\n\nYou would have to either be them or assume you’re a know it all to say that with certainty. And you’re not them. So that leaves option number 2.\n\n> It's safe to say that they simply had a mental illness.\n\nThat may be a reasonable guess for you to make based on having much less information about them and their experiences than they do. That may not be a reasonable guess for them to make, depending on what sort of verifications they had concerning their experiences."

    "text": ">What did you have in mind that's supposedly supernatural?\n\nLot's of things. Anything we don't yet understand scientifically. For instance we don't know if the Navier–Stokes Equation has solutions, and if it does, whether or not they are unique. We may know such things someday. We may not. At the moment those questions are beyond scientific understanding. By my dictionary's definition of supernatural, that means they are supernatural.\n\n>This whole post revolves around your misinterpretation of a word.\n\nYou mean it revolves around your claim that my dictionary has misinterpreted (or rather wrongly defined) a word.\n\n>It means things like magic for which there is no possible scientific explanation.\n\nI addressed this proposed definition above. You can repeat yourself over and over if you want. I don't see the point of doing that so I'll just refer you to above (where you already made this point, and where I already responded to it).\n\n>I am yet to see anyone successfully apply it to any real phenomena.\n\nThat's not a rational point to make about something that you've basically defined as something that can't be shown to be real. It is logically impossible to show that something we currently don't understand *will never be understood because we aren't capable of understanding it*. We would need to understand it first to say with certainty whether or not it is or isn't capable of being understood.\n\n>You simply don't know what you are talking about.\n\nFunny, that's the same thing many evangelical theists say to me when I disagree with them, like if my Bible translation says something different than what their's does. They always have to make it personal, even though I certainly know what my Bible says. In this case I certainly know what my dictionary says. You're just basically being an evangelical atheist... taking the same approach fundamentalists take when they debate, just with a different end goal.\n\n>If you aren't certain that the god exists, then you don't actually believe it. Belief involves certainty.\n\nBelief is faith, which is confidence. One does not have to be certain of something in order to be confident of it. For example I may believe my wife is going to pick me up from work today, having confidence because of all the other days she has. However, it is possible an accident may happen or something that prevents her. So I can't say I am absolutely certain she will do so. I can only believe (have confidence) that she will.\n\nYou say I don't know what I'm talking about. What's really going on here is you (and OP) are just re-defining words such that they basically match your conclusions.\n\n>, there's just no indication there of anything supernatural, just mental illness.\n\nI addressed this claim above. You can repeat yourself over and over if you want. Evangelical type people are gonna be evangelical I suppose, whether they're evangelical theists or evangelical atheists. I don't see the point of just saying the same thing over and over and over... so I'll just refer you to above (where you already made this point, and where I already responded to it)."

And I say that because it doesn't say \"our\" scientific understanding, and it says \"or the laws of nature\", and not \"our understanding of the laws of nature\".\n\nMeaning, if science can explain everything in the universe, and something appears that this science can't explain, then it must be coming from somewhere outside the universe.\n\nLaws of nature would mean all the laws that exist - and just wouldn't match with one particular species limited understanding of science.\n\n> That's silly. Being something \"we\" don't understand scientifically does not mean some of \"us\" understand it and others of us don't.\n\nI'd argue it could.

And I say that because it doesn't say \"our\" scientific understanding,\n\nI say “our” as a reference to whoever is using the term. Here, we are. So whatever we attribute to being beyond scientific understanding is, to us, supernatural to us by definition.\n\n> and it says \"or the laws of nature\", and not \"our understanding of the laws of nature\".\n\nLaws are what we understand them to be. If we don’t understand it to be a law, we don’t call it a law. Could it still be a law to someone else (like some more advanced intergalactic civilization)? Sure. It just wouldn’t be to us. My belly button could be a portal to another dimension as far as an alien knows. As far as I know, it is just a belly button.\n\nSimilarly we don’t call things that aren’t written in statutes and legal cases “laws of society.” There might be some alien civilization with other societal laws. That doesn’t have any bearing on what we know as laws though.\n\n>> That's silly. Being something \"we\" don't understand scientifically does not mean some of \"us\" understand it and others of us don't.\n\n> I'd argue it could.

Those of us participating in this discussion.\n\n> Supernatural has very specific connotations, usually gods/monsters/ghosts/magic…\n\nCertainly people often use the word supernatural to refer to those things. And that makes sense because typically they don’t claim to understand those things scientifically. So of course they are commonly considered supernatural.\n\nMany also use it to refer to things they claim are impossible to ever understand... so instead of meaning beyond our scientific understanding, or beyond current scientific understanding, they use it to mean beyond all scientific understanding of all beings for all time. The thing about using the word that way though is that it is logically impossible to show that something we currently don't understand is incapable of ever being understood, that it will never be understood. So OP has basically gone with a definition of supernatural that means ‘something that can't be shown to be real’ and then said, ‘therefore no one should accept that it exists.’ Of course no one should accept that it exists though, by that definition, as it is not only not understood but it is even impossible to detect at all *by anyone, by definition.* By a more sensible definition though, the supernatural includes things that might be detectable sometimes, by some people, but can rightly be called supernatural as long as they aren’t explicable or understood by science."

    "text": "> I say “our” as a reference to whoever is using the term. Here, we are. So whatever we attribute to being beyond scientific understanding is, to us, supernatural to us by definition.\n\nThen that just makes \"supernatural things\" a relative term, and it shouldn't be. If lightning is a natural thing, it should be a natural thing, regardless of whether a species knows what causes it or not.\n\n> Laws are what we understand them to be.\n\nI mean sure, since we're not done learning about reality... but to me, in the context of the definition, it's an assumed totality of \"laws of nature\".\n\nYou're needing to add \"our\" to each of those parts of the definition, and adding it actually decreases its effectiveness as a term. And sure, we don't know everything yet, which is why we wait to label it before we just slap the \"supernatural\" label on it.\n\n> What I mean by ‘we’ and ‘us’ is us. Those of us participating in this discussion.\n\nI know what you meant originally, as well as the other person. I was using a different route in my response.\n\nFor the other guy's response, I remember reading some excerpt where some tribe somewhere thought that travelers on ships were like gods visiting them on white clouds. To the sailors, it's just a boat with sails, but to the tribe it's the whole \"indistinguishable from magic\" thing. I just made his \"us\" your \"us\". Think about the beginning of star trek: into darkness, where Kirk and Bones ran from that early religious civilization and accidentally flew their ship over that civ and they dropped their old god to worship the shape of the ship. It can't both be supernatural and natural.\n\n> So of course they are commonly considered supernatural.\n\nI mean the idea of those is they are per the definition: they come from somewhere beyond our natural reality. Science can explain our natural reality, but science can't explain that, because it works by another set of rules that don't exist in our reality. They work by laws of nature that don't exist in our natural world.\n\nGod is uncreated/eternal whatever. Magic is often \"gifted\" to humans by Gods or higher creatures. Ghosts come from the realm of dead people. Monsters are often called \"unnatural\" and are often the result of twisted or dark magic or something. These things would meet the definition nicely, and are supernatural to use in every sense and throughout any level of our understanding.\n\n> Many also use it to refer to things they claim are impossible to ever understand... so instead of meaning beyond our scientific understanding, or beyond current scientific understanding, they use it to mean beyond all scientific understanding of all beings for all time.\n\nThe only ppl I see using it are people like you, and only on here. Anecdotal but it's sure not a common thing. Most people don't call dark matter supernatural, despite us not understanding it.\n\n> The thing about using the word that way though is that it is logically impossible to show that something we currently don't understand is incapable of ever being understood, that it will never be understood.\n\nWe may never know everything, sure. That doesn't mean we mix the \"unknown\" with \"supernatural\". If we don't know it, then we literally don't know it; we don't know if it's natural, or supernatural. By calling it supernatural, you're applying knowledge of its origins with the label. It's like calling a UFO \"aliens\" - you just called it unidentified, so why would it be alien beings?\n\n> So OP has basically gone with a definition of supernatural that means ‘something that can't be shown to be real’ and then said, ‘therefore no one should accept that it exists.’\n\nIs that a huge problem though? What should we do instead, believe anything and everything exists?\n\n> By a more sensible definition though, the supernatural includes things that might be detectable sometimes, by some people, but can rightly be called supernatural as long as they aren’t explicable or understood by science.\n\nWell OP already argues that they can be detectable and interact with us. Ghost hunters go to haunted places with their detector things, we have ouija boards, magic in media, etc.\n\nAgain, when we call things \"supernatural\" like gods/ghosts/magic we make an assumption, or have an understanding rather, that they are definitely from outside our reality. Let's say one day some people start to be able to do things that look like Harry Potter magic. At first we may sensationalize it and call it supernatural. Then scientists would study it to see if there is a natural cause for it. If we do, then we realize magic is somewhat real (I say somewhat because magic in lore is different, and it doesn't necessarily mean all imagined magic is real), and we stop calling it supernatural. But that's a special case because we kind of assume it will never be real, that's why we're so comfortable calling it supernatural now. But something like dark matter, which we don't understand - it just doesn't make sense to put in under the same definition as magic."
