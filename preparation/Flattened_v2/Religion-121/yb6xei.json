Removal has benefits as a practice of surgery there are benefits for a society to learn how to conduct surgery, especially primitive ones. Infant male circumcision is very rarely even remembered and has no impact on their psychology. Reality is humans have many health issues that compromise personal liberty. Babies require doctors to remove their ambilocal cord and may require other operations without their permission. Parents have the right to vaccinate their kids without their total informed consent because they wish to protect them from diseases.\n\nFemale circumcisions is a different ball game, because it is a different gender. There isn't much justification for it. It isn't a good comparison.\n\nFor religious reasons, it provides the identity of being in the gang."

Circumcision causes permanent damage that can never be repaired.  It should only be done on subjects capable of giving informed consent.  Vaccination is different because it has clear health benefits; circumcision has none.  It's a barbaric, needless mutilation carried out for ridiculous reasons and needs to stop.\n\n\nThe proof that your position is nonsensical is that there are countless men, not to mention male mammals of other species, that retain their foreskins through life and have no issues with them."

The comparison is equivalent in the manner that it is a medical procedure that is done without total informed consent.\n\n> To your point about STI transmission and cleanliness, we could just teach young boys to… wash themselves?\n\nThat's a teaching that is included in several religions. STD prevention doesn't matter for cleanliness, only abstinence of sex. With in several religions abstinence of sex is expected, while those non-religious often leave religions because they disagree with the limiting sex teachings, so they become more inclined to take of the risks of sexual behaviors.\n\n> the foreskin does contain many nerve endings which ultimately change the experience and pleasure of sex. That makes female circumcision and clitoral removal a very apt comparison.\n\nThe matter of rights relative to informed consent is an equivalent comparison yes. If the parents truly feel this is best for their child then they can do that, under a liberal secular world. However it is a different operation, and a different body part, with different consequences. Making it an unwise decision."

That's why it is comparable.\n\n> To your last point, you think that female circumcision should be permitted in a “liberal, secular world”?

By living in a secular world where we accept other religions and ways of life, then we accept their odd behaviors. We accept the existence of strange body modifications in Africa as part of their way of life. You know people would lose it if we started to take that away from them right?\n\n\n> In addition, you seem to imply that those who leave the religion due to sexual restriction are more likely to act without caution, causing them to engage in riskier sexual behavior. However, a clear argument could be made that it is precisely the lack of sexual education that leaves said individuals unable to adequately identify sexual risks.\n\nThe major religious groups do have sexual education, and they instruct their members not to have sex unless it's in marriage for children. The vast majority of people who leave these religions include sexual restrictions as part of their reason for leaving. It should be easy to understand, as its part of the social dialog of the sexual revolution. You don't get STDs when being celibate. Those who leave the religion are on their own, so it's their responsibility."

In this study, we examined whether infant male circumcision is associated with long-term psychological effects on adult socio-affective processing.\n\n> Results: Early-circumcised men reported lower attachment security and lower emotional stability while no differences in empathy or trust were found. Early circumcision was also associated with stronger sexual drive and less restricted socio-sexuality along with higher perceived stress and sensation seeking.\n\n> Conclusions: Our findings resonate with the existing literature suggesting links between altered emotional processing in circumcised men and neonatal stress.
