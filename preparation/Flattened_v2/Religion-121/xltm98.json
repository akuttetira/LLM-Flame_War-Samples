    "text": "Well as someone who was raised religious and then realized it was all make believe, those reasons do not work when trying to talk me out of suicide. When I was in the army I saw several suicides. After I got out, guess what, for some reasons beyond my understanding suicide started to seem like a good idea. So one day I loaded a shotgun and put it under my chin and started yelling uncontrollably for some reason (maybe to psych myself up?) know what helped me? My wife rushed in, hugged me, and said “if you pull the trigger you kill both of us” . Now what she did was not safe and no one should ever handle that situation that way, but the fact that it did saved my life. And that is where my Reddit name came from. I plan to be here next year , and the one after that. But I would be fibbing if I said that experiencing those suicides didn’t effect me permanently. The thought still passes through my mind most days. I just had to come up with my own reason for not killing myself. My reason is not going to be the same for everyone else."

If life was that easy no one would be suicidal or suffering. It’s a complex issue and you know nothing about it yet blame the victims for their suffering and that they tell others that want to “help” by stigmatising mental illness that they should stop is somehow wrong?\n\nDo you also tell boys that break their legs to “walk it off” and stop “whining”? You’re horrible"
