I didn't teach them there is no god at all.\n\nIn fact it wasn't ever something I raised with them, as they grew a bit older and found out about religion, of course they asked me my beliefs, I told them I didn't believe there are any gods, I doubt we spoke long about it because they already agreed with me.\n\nThey were also told what they believed was ENTIRELY their business, I would discuss whenever they wanted, but i was no way going to tell them what they should believe.\n\nI'm the same with politics.\n\nWhat you are describing is not how I would raise kids at all."

That doesn't mean they are for sure true but they could be. When you teach kids your beliefs are what YOU believe is true you're raising your kids to understand your beliefs, when you teach your kids that what you believe IS THE TRUTH and not to question it because you know it's true and they will too cause the Bible says it that's indoctrination. There's a difference between caring about your kids critical thinking and reasoning skills and giving them information for them to judge, vs shoving information down their throats and telling them to believe either for the reward of butterflies and rainbows or the punishment of fiery pits of hell for eternity. That's horrible parenting."

You’re position logically unfolds to “you can’t teach your kids anything or else you’re indoctrinating them. Let your 4 year old think for themselves!”"

    "text": "And throwaways are inherently wrong? I said what I did because you usually are close minded when it comes to opposing views. I made a comment here saying that indoctrinating children is wrong all around and instead parents should encourage their children to not latch onto views imposed on them and form their own opinions and views based on their own knowledge seeking then come to their own conclusions, then the parents should challenge their opinions and view because that's how life usually works. Views that have weight and tangibility to the real world can be defended where weaker views often fall apart. Thus making the child more rounded, if you will. At least that's my thoughts. Personally I'd like my child to be as open-minded as possible and consider all possible views from all angles."

    "text": ">It’s just called raising your kids.\n\nIndeed is it to some regard, however it's raising your kids in a bad way because as a parent, you should never enforce your personal views and opinions on your child. The responsibility of a parent is to *GUIDE* the child and encourage them to always question and be curious. Help them discover themselves by giving them options of subjects to explore for their minds to chew on. To never be sated with knowledge seeking and never settle on a single view or opinion. It should be taught that their opinions and views are their own conclusions and you as a parent and other individuals challenge their views as that how life works. You make the child critically think about their own views and opinions.\n\nAnything else is indoctrination. Your views don't matter as a parent. The child is the highest priority period. Never impose on the child. Children's minds are very malleable and impressionable and it's YOUR responsibility to make sure they're not moulded into a specific way of thinking without doing their diligence of extensive questioning and experiences.\n\nObjective education is the exception and by that I mean things like math, DIY work, car maintenance and so on."

Well, that’s one of the most difficult parts of being a parent…when/if children get influenced by MSM, the music industry, & social propaganda….who clearly have an agenda to turn people away from God and accept things like sexual immorality/pornography, hate, transgenderism, transhumanism…anything that is an abomination of God’s creation…it would be VERY hard to deal with!…that’s for sure!\n\nAll I can do at this point (my kids are 8 & 9 yrs old), is teach them about God’s word and help them to develop their own personal relationship with God.  I’m trying to be a good, loving, solid role model for them, & I believe it’s more important that they learn to pray, understand & believe that Jesus Christ truly loves them and died on the cross for their sins.  It’s more important for them to pray to God in their own words than necessarily reciting staple prayers that the church teaches.  Nevertheless….you ask a great question….and I pray 🙏🏻 that my children will not fall away from their faith and fall into the traps that the Devil has set up for us."

    "text": "You sound a lot like my mom who raised me in a similar way.\n\nAs an adult, I feel much different than she does about religion, and it is a strain on our relationship. I've found Christianity to be so senseless that the only conclusion I can come to is that it is man made. No MSM influence needed to get there, just the doctrine itself (and trust me, I've wholeheartedly accepted Jesus many, many times). Your statement about the Devil is a great example. The idea that God gives the Devil access to the creation he loves so much, and allows the Devil to trap us to the point where we can be ultimately punished for being deceived, boggles my mind.\n\nI have to wonder, if you believe in the biblical consequences of disbelief, why take the chance that it could happen to your own child? Would you unleash the Devil on your own children to test them?\n\nI'm not necessarily asking you to answer these questions, I'm just saying that your children may ask them of you one day as they begin to understand what it is they were indoctrinated into."

    "text": "Well, if I sound a lot like your mom…and she raised you in a similar way…then I can tell you that your mom loves you more than you could ever imagine! I’ve personally never loved another human being as much as I love my children🥰!..not even my own mother, and I’m very close to my mom and love her dearly! I’m telling you this because I want you to understand that I love my children SO MUCH that I would never… I mean NEVER teach my children something that I did not absolutely believe to be true myself….nor would I/will I ever allow them to be a part of any institution (schools, churches, groups) that teaches or promotes false doctrines that go against what the Bible (which is God’s own words) states….for as long as I can protect them from such things.  However, when they become adults, I will not be able to protect them from this sinful, fallen world. I do not wish to control them…I only want to protect them…but when they are adults, I will not be able to shelter them nearly as much. All I can do is teach them the fundamental teaching of God’s word, set a good example for them, and maintain a close relationship with them. I want them to freely come to me with any concerns or questions they have about why things are the way they are in the world, and why it’s SO important to remain close to God.  With technology advancing at such an exponential rate, there’s no way I will be able to shield them completely from the lies and deception that MSM, Hollywood, and evil government propaganda puts out there…but I will do everything possible to help them build a solid foundation mentally & spiritually!\n\nDo I believe in Biblical consequences of disbelief?  ABSOFREAKINLUTELY!!\nYou see God created us perfect…without sin…in His own image.  But once the Devil tricked Eve & Adam in the Garden if Eden, sin entered into our entire bloodline.  God cannot allow sin into Heaven because Heaven and everything in it is pure and without sin.  He could have just destroyed the creation of mankind right then and there…but He loved us so much that He wanted to give us a chance…to still live and thrive and have a chance at redemption.  He gave us the 10 Commandments- God’s law, and made it very clear that those who lived in sin would not obtain everlasting life in Heaven when they die.  But because it was not possible to live completely free of sin, God sent us a savior. He sent His own son, Jesus Christ to be born and raised as one of us…with the purpose that the time would come when the Devil would influence people in power to turn against him….and make him suffer more than any man before or after him by torturing Him, whipping him, spitting on Him, mocking Him, and nailing Him to a cross,where he died the most excruciatingly painful death. When He died, He descended into Hell where he conquered the Devil…paying the price for the sins of the whole world. Then on the third day, He literally rose from the dead…and appeared to the people…still having large holes in His hands and feet from the large nails that had once held Him to the cross.  He proved that He had conquered death….something that literally NO ONE had ever been able to do.  His death & resurrection was/is proof that we ALL can be saved from eternal damnation in Hell…NOT by anything we do (I.e. good works), but solely because of what HE did for us.  It is by Grace alone that we are saved.  We only need to BELIEVE in Jesus Christ’s death and resurrection in order to be saved.\n\nEphesians 2:4-10\n4 But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, 5 even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved— 6 and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, 7 so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. 8 For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, 9 not a result of works, so that no one may boast.   10 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them."

And we have no choice but to play his game? That is not a good God! I struggle to grasp why Christians bring more people into this world if they know for sure that such a God exists and there is a possibility that they will suffer in hell forever. Your love is no guarantee of that.\n\nWhat do you think about the Mormon, the Muslim, or the Hindu parent that feels just as strongly as you do about their beliefs?

That’s what he was about, right? Healing the broken, comforting the unwanted?
