Do you mean that Allah gave those kids in Arabia bigger vaginas so they could have sex, without pain,  with HIS creepy 53 y.o prophet?!"

And your excuse for this disgusting behavior towards this **immature child who played with dolls** is that we shouldn't assume she was immature because it was the 7th century? Be honest with yourself. A man like your prophet would be in jail for what he did in any modern country. Why do you allow this child molester to dictate your life?"

I love that your argument is “the hadiths say she was actually an older teen, but even if she was actually 9, it’s unfair to consider that wrong based on 7th C Arabia”\n\nEmbarrassing to read back rephrased, right?  Also…\n\n>\tThere is a whole science behind Hadith studies\n\nNo, boss.  That’s not “science” just because you use the word. It can certainly qualify as “studies,” but it’s about as important as someone who studies lord of the rings lore.\n\nMost Muslims I’ve seen here like to specifically divorce hadiths from the Quran, because it kinda delegitimizes it in a real way with regards to the religion being overall “peaceful”. The Hadith’s are where the religion becomes truly wicked and evil, like with apostasy. If anything, they’re a stain on an otherwise fairly decent religious text. Better than the Bible, at least.\n\nYou really want to lean on them to support an argument about a weird “prophet” screwing a child?  That’s pretty fun."

    "text": "Regardless of whether it's generally fair to compare the biological and cultural differences between seventh century nine year olds and modern nine year olds, do you think the omniscient Allah knew how people would perceive this today or not? If I heard that there was strong evidence that a modern fifty year old man had sex with a nine year old, I would conclude that he's a creep and not a representative of God. I actually left Mormonism when I learned that Joseph Smith married and had sex with a fourteen year old in the 1800s. I think reacting with revulsion to this is a good thing. So why would Allah let his representative do something knowing modern people would view it as abhorrent and conclude that Islam must be false? While pedophiles would be more likely to think it's fine? This isn't just a random person, Allah specifically *chose* Mohammad to be his representative."
