In Leviticus God says he wants to avoid sending the Iserlites into war so they don't flee back to Egypt, then a few weeks later the Amalekites attack and suddenly God does a 180 and tells them to wage war with them for generations!\n\nIt's clearly genocide... no just God would advocate genocide. Which ether means the Bible was full of lies to justify the evil ambitions of Moses (Most likely) or God is just a straight up racist, incompetent, totalitarian and no just person should fallow his teachings or believe he has any idea what he's doing.\n\nIndeed it's things like this that made me give up on the Bible as any kind of \"holy\" material. I think Star Wars and the Jedi are closer to representing objective Good then the Bible is now after reading it."

    "text": "What did we do to ISIS? Did we want to destroy their culture, and any people who would prefer to fight to the death than flee and blend in with other cultures, adopting their ways? Some definitions of 'genocide' include 'culture destruction' and for good reason: that's what was done by the [Canadian Indian residential school system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Indian_residential_school_system). Yes, a shocking number of children died, but that's not the only crime. The Canadians, in deep cooperation with the Roman Catholic Church, endeavored to destroy the culture of the indigenous peoples and \"civilize\" them. Now, do all cultures deserve to survive? How about Nazism? Do we want a single person to die while the culture is destroyed? Of course not.\n\nThe idea that the Amalekites' heinous activity was restricted to [Ex&nbsp;17:8–16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ex17.8-16&version=ESV), during the Israelites' Exodus from Egypt, is false. See [Judges&nbsp;3:12–14 and 6:1–6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=judg3.12-14%2C6.1-6&version=ESV). And for a comment contemporary to the situation:\n\n> Then Samuel said, “Bring here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites.” And Agag came to him cheerfully. Agag said, “Surely the bitterness of death is past.” And Samuel said, “As your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women.” And Samuel hacked Agag to pieces before YHWH in Gilgal. (1 Samuel 15:32–33)\n\nThe Amalekites had never changed their behavior—at least, according to the text. You can obviously question that text and if you do, and the facts are not what the text makes them seem, then I think a good number of Christians would condemn the command to end the Amalekite culture, and all who insisted on continuing that culture."

The best thing about not being bound to a God or religion I can condemn freely with the freedom of speech I have to criticize my government.\n\nBut, Christians can't condemn the command if they think their God is right. Hell, the other guy said they would commit genocide if their God told them to do it. This is the difference of religion and not. God is the scapegoat of actions while an non religious individual should, should be able to freely think for themselves."

    "text": "If there is eternal conscious torment, I want to be one of the tormented. Now that _that_'s handled, we can get to the rest of your comment.\n\n> The best thing about not being bound to a God or religion I can condemn freely with the freedom of speech I have to criticize my government.\n\nThe Bible I read has the best humans objecting to God. Like Moses objecting thrice, and convincing God each time. ([Ex&nbsp;32:9–14, Num&nbsp;14:11–20, and Num&nbsp;16:19–24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ex32.9-14;Num14.11-20;Num16.19-24&version=ESV)) The message is simple: all humans and deities are open game. Jesus, who was said to be \"the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature\", did a lot of commanding and smack downs, right? Wrong: he argued with people. Seemingly endlessly.\n\nNow, if you research people who have actually been _remotely_ threatening to the government, you'll see what has happened to them. When Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Chris Hedges _dared_ to question the glories of war in a 2003 commencement speech, you know what his employer the _NYT_ did? They gave him a formal reprimand. See, the Fourth Estate knows when it is time to bend the knee to **power**. Now, if you're just an insignificant random internet stranger, you will never threaten the state enough to get its attention. In fact, there's good reason to think that you generally have to prove that you're nonthreatening to gain appreciable power; here's former Harvard President Larry Summers' advice to Elizabeth Warren:\n\n> \"He teed it up this way: I had a choice,\" Warren writes. \"I could be an insider or I could be an outsider. Outsiders can say whatever they want. But people on the inside don't listen to them. Insiders, however, get lots of access and a chance to push their ideas. People -- powerful people -- listen to what they have to say. But insiders also understand one unbreakable rule: They don't criticize other insiders.\" ([Elizabeth Warren's New Book Skewers The White House Boys Club](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-book_n_5170018))\n\nWhat do you think would be successfully threatening to _that_? You and I can argue online until our fingers fall off and we're not going to be threats to anyone. Free speech is fine until you can actually hurt people, and then the censorship starts. That includes hurting those in power by exposing them for who and what they are.\n\n&nbsp;\n> But, Christians can't condemn the command if they think their God is right.\n\nWrong. Similarly, Abraham could have spoken against the command to sacrifice his son. In his 2021 [Abraham's Silence: The Binding of Isaac, the Suffering of Job, and How to Talk Back to God](http://bakerpublishinggroup.com/books/abraham-s-silence/380930), J. Richard Middleton argues that Abraham should have done just that."

    "text": "The increasing emphasis on the Amalekites and their villainy throughout the books of the Hebrew Bible has little to do with the actual history of the Amalekites. The text became so extreme through political disputes between Saulide and Davidic scribes, whose back-and-forth elevated the Amalekites from just another enemy people to a totally depraved archenemy nation.\n\nFor example, the commandment to destroy their animals was a brilliant development by Davidic scribes which repositions Saul's defeat of Amalek as a failure to uphold divine will because he didn't go far enough. As you note, it's very difficult to square this commandment with a general morality, but Rashi accomplishes it by explaining that the Amalekites were sorcerers who could turn into animals, so it really was necessary to wipe out the animals as well. Big if true!\n\nThe anti-Amalekite tradition has had three fruits: the first is a rhetorical base from which to demand total war against some national enemy of the Jews such as the Romans, the Nazis, or the State of Israel's enemies. This is a pretty vulgar thing, but if it helps build morale against the Nazis then that's a hell of a silver lining.\n\nThe second is Hasidic interpretations of Amalekites as representing some negative virtue which has to be totally expunged from the heart. This stuff is kinda corny in my opinion, but I imagine it's been useful for some.\n\nHere's where the anti-Amalekite tradition has real merit: when mercy is pled for the Amalekites. Theoretically, the Jews are commanded to totally destroy the Amalekites, but there's a long tradition of totally subverting the commandment. Samson Raphael Hirsch said only the remembrance of Amalek should be destroyed, and the Sfas Emes said that it's sufficient only to hate Amalek and leave his people alone. Maimonides says that the Amalekites are destroyed by making peace with them. And these interpretations are worth their weight in gold, because they establish that even when God Himself urges you to kill people, you should find any way possible not to kill those people. Even if they are the God-damned Amalekites! It fits into a running theme in Jewish tradition where God's bloodlust is questioned if not outright rejected.\n\nSo even from the anti-Amalekite tradition we can retrieve a moral teaching, a nonviolent one, one subversive of authority, even divine authority.\n\nOn a separate matter, it always weirds me out to see people who don't consider themselves Christians, who might even call themselves anti-Christianity, use the Christian idea of the \"Old Testament\" to discuss Jewish works which long predate Christianity. It suggests to me that they are not done interpreting the world through a Christian lens, especially when it accompanies an apparent apathy to secular scholarship on the texts being discussed."

Jews seem to keep to themselves and don’t rail against the “evils” of the modern world. Jews don’t try to pass laws discriminating against gay or transgender people, or try to outlaw abortion.\n\nWhen people talk about jewish stories in relation to Christianity it is because there are Christians who take the story of god committing genocide against the Amalekites 100% literally. They don’t think it’s a metaphor or a lesson against hatred can be gained from it, they believe that slaughtering tons and tons of people including infants is fine and good if god says it is. This is a twisted and terrifying way of looking at morality.\n\nSo when atheists use these stories to argue against Christianity it isn’t because they aren’t done looking at the world from a Christian worldview, it’s because they see the creeping horror of Christian fundamentalism and want to address it."

I’m sure some people on both sides see it that way, but there’s more to it than that. Saying that the division there is all tribalism kind of feels like both-siderism, in the sense that if both sides hate each other for trivial reasons then they are both equally wrong, but in some issues it is clear that one side is on the correct side of history and the other isn’t.\n\nTake the debate on this post for instance. One could frame it as theist versus atheist tribalism and say that each sides hate the other for equally dumb reasons. But I don’t think that’s the case. One side is arguing against genocide, while the other is arguing that some genocides are good. There’s a clear right and wrong here.\n\nRepublicans are the ones who take fundamentalist religious positions like this, and I think that connection needs to be openly acknowledged.

The parties themselves started out as one party (vs. the Federalists) and then separated among racial/North-South lines.\n\nGrowing up in the South in the 1980s, I noticed that most people were Democrats except those who lived in the non-agricultural mountains (who were Republicans because they were pro-Union and had no economic interest in the plantation/slave-based system of the Deep South).\n\nThere was no difference in terms of political beliefs among Southern Dems or GOP at that time. They were all conservative except in a minority of metro areas like Memphis, Little Rock, Atlanta, etc. (and even they were only moderate). Southern Democrats then were the same people who are now Southern Republicans.

Or that maybe Jews represent the negative virtues of our hearts that we must expunge. Or that the total command to exterminate Jews offers us an opportunity to investigate the questioning of supreme authority.\n\nThat would be horrible! Like, beyond horrific! Taking one of the worst and most evil things imaginable and turning it into a fun storytelling device or a neat chance to discuss abstract ideology, while refusing to treat it as the horror that it is, and even upholding the tradition that spews it! Nazi genocide is just not redeemable, and insensitive and inhuman attempts to redeem it are colossally evil. And the same goes for Amalekite genocide. It's not some hole you can patch or sterilely opine about. It's fatal to the entire collection of belief systems, right then and there."

For example:\n\n>Not only that, but the actual contents of Mein Kampf are repulsive. Sure, if you make an extraordinary effort to gloss over or reinterpret the repulsive passages, you can do it, but this is more trouble than it is worth and might very well leave some lingering mental poison behind. Germany should completely lose all the baggage of Nazism and replace it with a completely democratic society that has no causal linkage whatsoever to its bloody past.\n\nIt does a good job of showing just how absurd the reinterpretation of genocidal passages really is by taking it out of the familiar context of the Torah. Reinterpreting passages shouting for a total Amalekite genocide into a moral lesson is not so different from reinterpreting Mein Kampf into a moral lesson. If that moral lesson is \"Hitler is horrible and we should decry Nazism wherever we find it\", then great, but that's not the moral lesson you're drawing from the Torah."

And to the extent that carriers of that ideology are willing to die to support it, aren't you willing to **exterminate** them if need be? One of the definitions of 'genocide' is \"culture destruction\". Surely you would prefer that every Nazi simply abandon his/her ideology/&#8203;culture. And there are some intermediate options, as long as the State can keep sufficient tabs on neo-Nazis. But ultimately, _genocide_ against Nazism seems to be on the table.\n\nYou seem as willing to characterize Nazis as beyond hope (unless they abandon that ideology/&#8203;culture) as many are willing to characterize Amalekites as beyond hope (unless they abandon that ideology/&#8203;culture)."

    "text": "> The problem with this approach is that we can derive a moral teaching from literally anything.\n\nu/LegalToFart said that among Jews, it's expected that one _challenge God_. I would add: like Moses did, _thrice_. ([Ex&nbsp;32:9–14, Num&nbsp;14:11–20, and Num&nbsp;16:19–24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ex32.9-14;Num14.11-20;Num16.19-24&version=ESV)) If one is expected to challenge the creator of the universe, then any other human is open game. Political leaders, religious leaders, economic leaders, intellectual leaders. All of them. Anyone who claims to be above critique is claiming to be above the Most High. This is precisely what Job's friends did and they got quite the smack-down in [Job&nbsp;42:7–9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=job42.7-9&version=ESV). Job, on the other hand, gets compared with Behemoth ([Job&nbsp;40:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=job40.15&version=ESV)), right after God asks him if he can do things 100% consonant with [Gen&nbsp;1:26–28 and Ps&nbsp;8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen1.26-28%3Bps8&version=ESV).\n\nThe same country which gave birth to Liberal Protestantism is the country which slaughtered six million Jews, homosexuals, Roma, disabled people, … Interpreting away or pretending away the dark potentials within us merely allows for more genocides to happen. We could have saved 1000 Rwandans for every 1 US soldier, but we were afraid of _reputation loss_. ([WP: Rwandan genocide § United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide#United_States)) We are willing to economically punish Russia for attacking people who look and talk like us, but when it comes to a minority in China which has a different skin color, different religion, different language, and different social practices, we do little to oppose the atrocity. ([WP: Uyghur genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghur_genocide)) China is literally kidnapping Uyghurs from around the world and we just don't care to do what it would take to _stop that evil_. ([CNN article](https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/08/middleeast/uyghur-arab-muslim-china-disappearances-cmd-intl/index.html))\n\nIt seems to me that we need to do _more_ to face our wickedness, not less. Only by courageously admitting how wicked we can be, can we make progress in solving the problem. If you think it's wicked for God to make clear how wicked we are, then maybe say that, _explicitly_?\n\nThe thing is, really fighting the evils of humans in the 21st century would require going toe-to-toe with **power**. Pulitzer Prize-winning _NYT_ columnist Chris Hedges did this in the tiniest way, when he gave a commencement address at Rockford College in 2003. He spoke of how war is not glorious, how comradeship is the opposite of friendship. His mic was cut multiple times and the _NYT_ issued him a formal reprimand. He learned something important from that experience: the Fourth Estate bends the knee to **power** when commanded. ([HuffPo article](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/american-patriots-would-k_b_827000)) Jews are used to this fact because of all their prophets who were mocked, tortured, imprisoned, exiled, and executed. Christians are because Jesus threw himself into the meat grinder, to expose the heinous mechanism for what it is. Until and unless you are willing to suffer like Job, you will be vulnerable to **power**. You will either be insignificant and so not worth its time, you will dance when commanded to dance, or you will pay the price. Judaism and Christianity, when at their best, train up members to pay that price, while making it as costly as possible on the part of the State. And yet, you say that Judaism is beyond redemption. I'm betting you think the same of non-Marcion following Christians?"

Sometimes that means criticism is still allowed, but elevating a genocidal text to a special status is bad. There is a difference between a text which talks about a genocide (e.g. the wikipedia article on WWII) and a genocidal text (e.g. Mein Kampf), and the Torah falls into the latter category.\n\nAgain, if someone made a flavor of Nazism that didn't encourage genocide at all and reinterpreted Mein Kampf as a morally upstanding text, that would be a wrong thing to do.

Obviously destroying the nation in the first place is the morally challenging idea, which is why Jewish thinkers have wrestled with/against it for millennia.\n\nIt also speaks to the way that Medieval thinkers approached superstition and sorcery. When you see these things as impossible like you or I would today, then anything with the capacity to do it is magical and merits preservation. When you see sorcery and witchcraft as a real and insidious part of the world, then you approach it more practically, so to speak. \"Oh, these guys can turn into animals?

It fits into a running theme in Jewish tradition where God's bloodlust is questioned if not outright rejected.\n\nThat's pretty far from how Christians consider their god. Christians are _not_ generally encouraged to question or reject God's orders. I don't know about you, but I had a lot of experience being a Christian, and that paragraph above is an alien way of thinking about god to me. It has more of a vibe of a father and a child than of an omnipotent all-knowing, all-loving being commanding a doomed helpless imperfect creation.\n\nAnother example I can think of is is just an anecdote that affected me: a jewish friend of mine once told me that the \"devil\" in Job is just an angel that is tasked with the stuff that happens in Job. He's not \"satan\", or at least, he's not on the \"badguy team\" apart from God, and that in fact, there is no \"badguy team\" that is apart from God. But again, that's just me saying some stuff a friend of mine told me once, so I don't even know if that's right or not. It was just a totally different way of thinking about it than the Christian perspective."

It kind of sounds like they are much more open to interpretation on these things than Christians. Which might not be bad in some ways but it does make it a bit annoying to argue against because you can point out something horrible in the text such as this genocide and they can just say, \"Well actually we don't read it this way and if you look at it in this one particular manner and don't read too much into it then it isn't so bad,\" which really doesn't make sense with something that is supposed to be divinely given to humanity as a guide for our actions. It gives off an air of, \"we don't actually believe what we claim to believe,\" which is another issue that Christians often also face with their beliefs.\n\nIf these things are well known to the Jewish community wouldn't they remove those parts of their scripture or change them? Those stories are still written that way and were taken for their literal writing at one point in time. And even if you can interpret it differently, this also seems to be a pretty clear reading of the passages and at face value it is horrible. Just seems odd to believe in it at all if this is the understanding. It seems confusing for confusions sake.\n\nThank you for the detailed explanation though, I appreciate the time you put into it."

Maybe with Judiasm it also includes \"cultural historical artifacts and traditions that bind Jews together as a people\". /u/LegalToFart said himself that studying Jewish texts is part Jewish identity and gave it as an example when it was suggested he should \"discard Judaism\":\n\n> What does this mean practically?

So, at least to that person, studying the texts is more Jewish than believing in God.\n\nMy understanding is that Jewish texts are some of the oldest on the planet, that they come from oral traditions that predate written history, and that to Jews they're an important part of their identity. So, I _think_, it's like, if you're a jew that disagrees with a belief in a text, that doesn't mean the text itself isn't an important part of the history of the Jewish people. Like, maybe the story didn't happen, but the fact that it was written means something important about Jewish identity. So, erasing this story about the Amelekites would just be like destroying a cultural historic artifact."

Greek mythology is very cool and interesting but if people were trying to claim that it is true and wanted to make laws based on those beliefs I would fight tooth and nail against it, even though it is something that I personally love to read about.\n\nBut then we should also be able to make arguments against these texts. It needs to be accepted that they are false. We need to hold them to their place, as historical artifacts, not as truth. So as soon as anyone crosses that line, where they start to believe that these words are true, we need to be able to fight against those ideas, which is what the OP is doing.\n\nI don't like the argument of various interpretations to be used because it attempts to mitigate the fact that these stories are still used today for horrendous things.

If he had gotten down to one, we would have seen whether God saw Lot as righteous. I'm iffy myself; he was willing to give his daughters over to be raped (and perhaps killed?) in order to save the visitors.\n\nYou've made me wonder whether God intentionally sets up Godself as a scapegoat of sorts, bringing the worst of humanity to light, to see if anyone wants to push for a better way. This is totally opposite of humanity's tendency to pretend it is more righteous than it in fact is. Our pretending permitted the Holocaust to happen, and Liberal Protestantism's reinterpretation or just outright rejection of the texts which showed how evil humans can be, may well have contributed.\n\nHow many people condemn the genocide of the Amalekites, while either not knowing that the US could have saved 1000 Rwandan lives per 1 US life, or not caring? ([WP: Rwandan genocide § United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide#United_States)) Like the Roman Catholic Church preferred its reputation to dealing with the heinous acts of its priests (we could add in countless Protestants as well—see the recent SBC report), the US was terrified of another Battle of Mogadishu embarrassment. We were so worried about being _embarrassed_ that we permitted hundreds of thousands of Rwandans to be murdered. And if you want to say that it was really European nations which enflamed the animosity between Tutsis and Hutus during Colonization, we can shift the blame to them.\n\nSome time ago, I came across the Christian Think Tank article [Shouldn't the butchering of the Amalekite children be considered war crimes?](https://www.christian-thinktank.com/rbutcher1.html). The main takeaway I got was that God was really after _culture destruction_, which is one of the definitions of 'genocide'. I say that the West wanted to destroy the _culture_ of ISIS, but without necessarily killing a single human in the process. If so, the Israelites would have been welcome to infer this intention of God's, and argue for a more humane way to accomplish it. Permitting the Amalekites to continue raiding the Israelites as is reported in [Judg&nbsp;3:12–14 and 6:1–6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=judg3.12-14%2C6.1-6&version=ESV) was not acceptable.\n\nMoses is obviously the archetype of challenging God's plans, which he does thrice: [Ex&nbsp;32:9–14, Num&nbsp;14:11–20, and Num&nbsp;16:19–24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ex32.9-14;Num14.11-20;Num16.19-24&version=ESV). In a fourth instance, he asks God to kill him if God won't remove his anger: [Num 11:10–15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=num11.10-15&version=ESV). What makes Moses different from most people I see talking about these events is that he actually knows what God is trying to do, and doesn't question that. He merely says that God's _means_ are profoundly suboptimal.\n\nAnyhow, those cheering the violence in the Tanakh, such as [Num&nbsp;31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=num31&version=ESV), are thereby exposed for who and what they are. This can be contrasted to those who recognize that something has to be done to protect the Israelites from threats, but desperately push for better ways.\n\nVery thought-provoking comment!

Though many interpret the Binding of Isaac as proof of Abraham’s faith, there’s many Jewish people who actually hold it is when Abraham failed. He took Isaac up with him and then came back alone and we scarcely hear about Abraham again following the event. He should have stood his ground and said “I won’t sacrifice my son” but didn’t and in doing so he failed G-d’s test."

This just goes to show how much more willing Jews are to wrestle with God, than Christians. :-|\n\nYoram Hazony contends that Abraham never saw Isaac again after the event, based on a close reading of the text. ([The Philosophy of Hebrew Scripture](https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/religion/judaism/philosophy-hebrew-scripture?format=PB&isbn=9780521176675), 119–20) I wonder if that was a very suboptimal way to _weaken_ Abraham's formative influence on Isaac, so that he didn't try to make Isaac a mini-me and therefore stunt God's promise by remaking it in Abraham's image. The fact that Abraham was willing to sacrifice his son does indicate that he was willing to leave fulfillment of the promise in God's hands, rather than keep it in Abraham's hands now that he had a miraculous son. But it seems that Abraham could have arrived at the same willingness to _not_ make Isaac into a mini-me, via a different path.\n\nThere's also a good chance that Abraham's home culture thought child sacrifice was 100% normal. Some wish that God would just have uttered a proposition to not do it, rather than take Abraham through the ringer. The thing is, this way God exposed Abraham's willingness to do it, which is valuable for Abraham to know. And it's a very dramatic way to say that _YHWH will not demand child sacrifice_. One can even amplify the intensity of that by turning to Annie Murphy Paul's 2012-03-17 _NYT_ opinion [Your Brain on Fiction](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/opinion/sunday/the-neuroscience-of-your-brain-on-fiction.html). Briefly, she says that narratives activate sensory and motor neurons, while propositions do not. Arguably, one actually imagines the event with narratives, while propositions are far weaker. Possibly, the almost-sacrifice of Isaac was the most cognitively effective way God had, to try to convince the Israelites to never do that dastardly deed."

Figuring it out is *our* responsibility, we can't outsource our moral judgement to anyone else, not even to God Himself.\n\nThis dynamic is core to stories like Abraham arguing with God about the fates of Sodom and Gomorrah:\n\n>Abraham spoke up, saying, “Here I venture to speak to my lord, I who am but dust and ashes: What if the fifty innocent should lack five? Will You destroy the whole city for want of the five?” “I will not destroy if I find forty-five there.”\n\nMoses demanding God pardon the Jewish people:\n\n>Moses went back to HASHEM and said, “Alas, this people is guilty of a great sin in making for themselves a god of gold.

How could one not know that it's not a good idea to wipe out a civilization or city, and not take every individual into account? I don't have \"godlike\" powers, nor does anyone. But most people can figure out that the innocent should not be included along with the guilty in the Sodom and Gomorrah deal?\n\nBut, actually, I do understand that the Judeo-Christian god is a c-unt. To me, the best example is in Iyov - Job.\n\nFrom Chabad.org:\n\n>Verse 1. There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job, and that man was sincere and upright, God-fearing and shunning evil.\n\n>Verse 2. Now seven sons and three daughters were born to him.\n\n\n>Verse 12. Now the Lord said to the Adversary, \"Behold, all that he has is in your hands; only upon him do not stretch forth your hand.\" Now the Adversary left the presence of the Lord.\n\nThen:\n\n>Verse 18. While this one was still talking, another one came and said, \"Your sons and daughters were dining and drinking wine at the home of their firstborn brother,\n\n>Verse 19. when, behold, a great wind came from the other side of the desert, and struck the four corners of the house; it fell upon the youths, who died, and only I alone escaped to tell you.\"\n\n\nTo me, to *me*, the story has never been about Job. To me, it has always been about the 7 sons and 3 daughters. There they were, minding their own business, then JHWH and Satan/Beelzebub/Lucifer/the Adversary made a bet. Just like at the horse races or a bar bet with the guy sitting next to you at a bar. And there the sons and daughters were, hanging out, having fun, and bam, they get wiped out because of some stupid-ass bet. Who cares about Job? What about 10 kids that get wiped out because JHWH and the Adversary were at a bar, hanging out, getting drunk and they made that bet. JHWH is a dick.\n\nNow, Rabbi Moshe ben Nachman, the Ramban, says it is “I am G-d, and you are only a tiny, finite human being – you can’t possibly hope to understand the way I run My world. Everything I do is just, even if you can’t see the justice.”\n\n\"Everything I do is just, even if you can’t see the justice.\" That's a nice little \"out,\" isn't it? I'm going to use that in a court of law sometime.\n\n.\n\nSo really, your example of Abraham arguing with your God regarding Sodom and Gomorray and winning juxtaposed with your god wiping out 10 children for funsies, shows the inconsistencies in the Torah/Bible.\n\nBecause you are saying that Abraham and others beat your god in morality, but then Ramban says that your god says, \"Everything I do is just,\"\n\nTherefore, your god is a trickster. He knows the right answer, he is just fucking with Abraham and Moses.\n\n>Elijah said to him: The Holy One, Blessed be He, smiled and said: My children have triumphed over Me; My children have triumphed over Me.\n\nAccording to the Book of Job, and Ramban, the children cannot possibly triumph over your god. Unless your god is just fucking with Elijah or Moses or Abraham.\n\n>Still in that case I wouldn't call it trickery. Nobody's being made the butt of a joke here.\n\nElijah,  Moses, and Abraham were the butt of the joke, and more abstractly, so is the entire population of the world.\n\nBut it is funny that people think that the jewish-christian god is just and good:\n\n[evil from god]\n\n>1 Samuel 19:9-10  an evil spirit 'from the Lord' came upon Saul as he was sitting in his house with spear in hand\n\n>Proverbs 16:4  The Lord has made everything for his own ends, even the wicked for the evil day.\n\n>Jeremiah 42:9-10 Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, ... I regret the evil I have done you.\"\n\n>Isaiah 45:7 \"I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things.\"\n\n>Amos 3:6 Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD hath not done it?\n\nThanks, jewish-christian god.

Here's where it becomes war,\n\nthis god recognizes that there is an enemy trying to pull his people away from the good. Therefore action must be taken.

On one hand, war isn't pretty. But I think we can all agree that it is necessary sometimes.\n\nOn the other hand, failing to act would be letting your children be tortured and pulled away from anything good.\n\nIt's not enjoyable, obviously, but what about if you don't fight?

This is why God punished them to the degree He did, not only did they play dirty, but they disrespected God who was trying to bring His people to the good He had in store for them.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the God wiped them out 1 time, not over and over again.\n\n>Second of all, god is omnipotent and omniscient. Therefore he could do any number of things to protect the Israelites from the Amalekites forever. He could have made it so any Amalekite that stepped within 30 feet of an Israelite with the intent of harming them immediately exploded, or something. He has an inifinite number of tools at his disposal, any of which would eschew killing babies.\n\nGod won't stop people from going against Him and, obviously, He would rather they just follow Him. But they chose a path just as God let's everyone do.\n\n>And even if you want to argue the Amalekites were completely evil, God could have rendered them impotent so they would not have children. Then when the Israelites killed them, they would only be killing people who could take moral responsibility for their actions. But if you believe that god knows the soul of every person and chooses what body they are born into, that means that god CHOSE to put souls into infant bodies that he knew without a doubt would be slaughtered within a few weeks or months. He created more babies juts to raise the number of babies that would be slaughtered\n\nGod used everyone and everything as an example here. When you not only visciously kill the weak and feeble of God's people but also do it to disrespect Him, you are guilty of holding back His purpose for good as I mentioned above. It is also worth noting that babies and children who can't choose between good and evil go to heaven.\n\n>And your reply says nothing of the animals either. Again, even if you go with the (dubious) assertion that every single Amalekite was evil, killing the animals makes no sense. Donkeys and camels could not possibly have been evil.\n\nThis is explained above.\n\nThanks!"

It sounds suspiciously like you are desperately reaching for anything that might resemble justification.\n\nSo all we really know is that some Amalekites attacked the Israelites once, and killed the weakly and sick. That’s pretty bad. But you know what’s infinitely worse? Genocide!\n\nBecause some Amalekites, presumably soldiers, but possibly just bandits who happened to be from the same country, it isn’t specified, attacked the Israelites ONE TIME that means that every single one of them must’ve been evil, and even the babies deserved death? That’s quite a logic jump you’ve made there. You’re all in on genocide on a hunch!\n\nEven if babies and children go to heaven, which again, I don’t see where the proof of that is. These infants clearly didn’t accept jesus as their personal savior, god decided to put them into bodies just so they could be slaughtered. Why not cut out the middle man and just not have them be born, or have them be born, but to different parents? God decided to make babies just so that there would be babies who he could make his people kill. That’s almost comically evil and over the top. Perhaps god wanted to make an example, but if he did he went way overboard. You can make a strong statement without genocide, especially if you’re god. He didn’t make himself look powerful here, he made himself look like a genocidal maniac."

But as I studied the Bible more and more I began to see that these people possessed traits and did things that resembled what satan is all about. Attacking people when they are weak, hating God, doing whatever they can to get ahead regardless of who they hurt, and had no problem with  violently raiding for no reason other than pure greed.\n\n>So all we really know is that some Amalekites attacked the Israelites once, and killed the weakly and sick.\n\nAnd the women and children, and whoever was at the back. The Bible doesn't specify exactly how many there were, but a battle ensued after the initial attack so there must have been an army's worth.\n\n>That’s pretty bad. But you know what’s infinitely worse? Genocide!\n\nIt's more like direct payback. The old law was based strongly in blood for blood so, again it's not really genocide, just direct payback.\n\n>Because some Amalekites, presumably soldiers, but possibly just bandits who happened to be from the same country, it isn’t specified, attacked the Israelites.\n\nI adress this above, but is clear there was an army's worth.\n\n>ONE TIME\n\nGod only ordered total destruction once too.\n\n>that means that every single one of them must’ve been evil, and even the babies deserved death?\n\nAgain, blood for blood, the babies being killed were a direct payback and for an example like I said before.\n\n>That’s quite a logic jump you’ve made there.\n\nNot really, it's way more flat than you think.\n\n>You’re all in on genocide on a hunch!\n\nDirect payback isn't genocide. God didn't shoot first in this matter, or in any matter in the Bible.\n\n>Even if babies and children go to heaven, which again, I don’t see where the proof of that is.\n\nMatthew 18:3-4. 3 And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.\n\n4 Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.\n\nThese verses are implying that children possess the innocence of one who has been redeemed.\n\n>These infants clearly didn’t accept jesus as their personal savior,\n\nAgain they go to heaven.\n\n>god decided to put them into bodies just so they could be slaughtered.\n\nHe used them as a direct payback and to teach a lesson.\n\n>god decided to put them into bodies just so they could be slaughtered. Why not cut out the middle man and just not have them be born, or have them be born, but to different parents?\n\nA payment was required for the other babies blood that was spilled, innocently I might add.\n\n> decided to make babies just so that there would be babies who he could make his people kill.\n\nAddressed above.\n\n> That’s almost comically evil and over the top.\n\nAlmost as evil as attacking someone who is weak for no reason.\n\n> god wanted to make an example, but if he did he went way overboard.\n\nImportant to note that it was a payment too.\n\n>You can make a strong statement without genocide,\n\nIt wasn't just a statement, it was a required payment too.\n\n>He didn’t make himself look powerful here\n\nAsk the amalakites that question.\n\n>he made himself look like a genocidal maniac.\n\nSo the amalakites weren't? And even though they mercilessly killed the weak and innocent for no reason? , *cough cough* infants and elderly and anyone who happened to be weak and at the back of the pack *cough cough*\n\nBut seriously why should they get away with that?\n\nAnd why is a direct payback so bad or so far from what they did?"

He will only payback for what is offended. if that is women and children He will repay the same , He isn't in the wrong for avenging innocent life is He?\n\n>Nazi Germany did some terrible things.

Not tenfold.\n\n>Hmmm, was there someone in the Bible who took issue with committing more violence in response to violence? Hmmm, who was that?\n\n>Oh that’s right, it was CHRIST! You know, the guy who CHRISt-ianity is fucking named after ?! He said to turn the other cheek didn’t he? Well brutally slaughtering every single man woman child and animal in an entire nation doesn’t sound like turning the other cheek to me.\n\nChrist taught no judgement here on earth, that's kinda the basis of the new testament . But what people miss is that they still have a judgement( i.e. an eternal hell) on the way. These people aren't getting off the hook for what they've done (except through salvation of course)\n\nSo that brings me full circle back to my previous question. Did they or did they not deserve judgement."

Unless you can point to me in the Bible where it says all of these things about the Amalekites then the most you are doing is broadly speculating about what the Amalekites have done at absolute best, and is just making things up at worst.\n\nYou’re making a circular argument. You say that god is good, but when the point is made that genocide is evil, you say it must have been justified. When I ask why it was justified, you say, god is good, but that just puts us back at the beginning. If god really is good, why would he not state that every on of the Amalekites was evil? If he stated that openly, it would have made him seem less like a murderous psychopath. However, he chooses not to. He chooses to leave making the Amalekites look evil to people like you. Why? It doesn’t make any sense.\n\nThe people following Adolf Hitler thought he was good too. They thought the Jews deserved what they got. They thought the holocaust was in retribution for what the Jews had done to their country. You really aren’t making arguments any different from the ones they would have made. You just think your arguments are different because you think your personal dictator is the good one because he says he is.\n\nPerhaps my words earlier sounded harsh, but I don’t apologize for them. You are using the exact same argument that the most evil people in history have used to justify genocide. You are on the pro-genocide side here. Just think about that for a second. You are advocating for slaughtering unarmed civilians. You are arguing for murdering defenseless children, many of whom would be begging for their lives in terror. You think the person slicing their throats and watching them bleed out in front of their screaming friends and family would be the righteous good guy in this situation. You can hardly expect someone not to use stronger language when you advocate such a position. If you want to defend genocide you have to own it. Stepping back and acting like I’m the crazy one for reacting the way any normal person would to someone who defends genocide is remarkably disingenuous. I don’t say this because I hate you , I say this because you really seem not to understand what you’re arguing for.\n\nThis isn’t really a “we can agree to disagree “ kind of situation. The fact that people like you who will ardently defend wholesale massacre is rather terrifying. We’d better hope you don’t someday hear a voice from heaven saying it’s god commanding you to to shoot up the nearest school. Because by your arguments it seems reasonable to infer that you’d do it. Really I’m not trying to be hyperbolic here, but the fact that people with your views, that genocide is fine and dandy as long as god says so, are walking around with us regular people who think genocide is wrong at all times is scary."

    "text": ">Well, the moral system is that God is what dictates right and wrong. Without a belief that believes in an absolute authority, it all becomes relative opinions\n\nAs opposed to here, where they're absolute opinions?\n\nDivine command theory isn't a moral theory, it's a moral hand wave. Under that theory, what makes killing wrong isn't that it kills people. It's not the destruction of their life and all possible goods, it's not the pain inflicted on surivivors or the fear on other potential victims, it's not even the callousness of doing so. It is, actually, *nothing* to do with the fact that you killed someone at all.. What makes killing wrong is that another being- a being in no way involved in the act- doesn't like you doing it, and will get mad at you if you do.\n\nThis is, bluntly, a child's view of morality. An appeal to Daddy Says wrapped up in fancy language. What makes murder wrong, whether we end up appealing to deontological imperatives or hedonistic calculi or virtues and vices, has to in some way tied into the fact that *death is bad.* It has to in some way involve facts about the act of murder. The idea that murder is bad because it's *against the rules,* that killing someone is evil in the same way moving your pawn diagonally in a chess game is, is absurd. There's a reason very few serious philosophers, even serious christian philosophers, still hold to divine command theory. It makes a mockery of ethics, reducing human wellbeing to an arbitrary divine thumbs up, and should be left back in the classical era where it came from."

What makes killing wrong is that another being- a being in no way involved in the act- doesn't like you doing it, and will get mad at you if you do.\n\nBut that's not the case. The reason one shouldn't kill is that there is an understanding of being made in the image of God for each individual, regardless of their background, actions, culture, etc.\n\n\nSorry, but I bet a lot of people don't kill because it is against the rules. If you removed the consequence of murdering someone from society, murders would probably increase. If someone raped someone I knew and there was no law agaisnt it, why shouldn't I kill the rapist? If someone scammed me and is going around scamming other people, why shouldn't I kill the scammer? If someone is selling contaminated drugs and it's harming people, why shouldn't I kill the drug dealer?\n\nIf death is bad, why are so many people in favor of euthanasia? Than eventually one will get into the topic of abortion.\n\nWhich Chrisitan principle is so dentrimental to today's society?"

In the context of a “purposeless universe”, as you call it, God is made up and the story is most likely a fable or a justification for a human-sponsored genocide. Then it’s easy - this act isn’t justified. It does maximal harm to a tremendous amount of people, something that most human society (including modern western societies which I assume we’re both a part of) has subjectively deemed immoral since the dawn of humanity. There may also be societies (like the ancient Hebrew one that saved this story/fable perhaps?) that may have agreed that some genocides can be subjectively moral - and use the notion of god to objectify, or make more concrete, their subjective choices.\n\nSo how do you justify this in your world view?

    "text": ">OP just wrote a giant rant.\n\nYa, you're probably right.\n\n>Why would I need to justify that it is good for God to judge a depraved people?\n\nIn a world where god's existence was known and provable, he would be able to justify it himself in a way that would be evident to everyone.\n\nI probably wouldn't require that of you. I'd start at the beginning: First prove that a god exists to pass judgement on a people. Then prove it is in this god's domain to pass judgement on a people - that him ordering the cleansing of a \"depraved people\" is different than what the Nazis or Bosnians or Rwandans did. Then prove that it was this god that spoke into Samuel's head, which person then told a nations king to gather his army and commit genocide against an entire other nation (including the slaughter of women and children). the Bible is the claim, not the evidence. It claims that god said things to Samuel which led to a \"god justified\" genocide. These claims requires evidence before it can be justified with \"because god said so\". It's seems disturbing to me to accept a genocide as \"justified\" based on faith. Feels like it would need more grounding than \"I believe a god I hope exists spoke inside an authority figures head and said to do it.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>So the statement \"the act isn't justified\" is a subjective statement? As in, it is true to you, but it has no weight or truth external to you? (which is what subjective means)\n\n\"The act isn't justified\" is an objective statement based on our societies subjectively agreed upon standards of maximal benefit and minimal harm. But having no truth external to myself is not what subjective means - it does have weight and truth external to myself. As I said previously, it is grounded in what entire societies of humans have agreed on since the dawn of humanity. It is grounded in our evolved sense of empathy (which isn't unique to humans even). It is grounded in our evolved sociality as a species. It is grounded in these, and other, characteristics that have evolved to benefit our survival.\n\nWe also have evidence of societies that have subjectively agreed that committing acts of genocide are ok - I offer the current matter of the hebrews and the amalekites as one examples - but there are plethora of other and more recent examples I'm sure you're aware of (some of them claiming to be acting in behalf of a god, the same way Samuel and Saul and David did).\n\nUntil evidence is provided to substantiate all these god claims, saying anything like a genocide against an entire nation is justified by that god feels pretty disturbing. Believing in god as a faith position is one thing, but saying that the slaughter of an entire nation of men, women, and children is justified as a faith position feels like a massive short-circuit in good reasoning.\n\nIf it really happened (no real evidence to suggest that it did), it'd be interesting to get the Amalekites side of the story. I wonder if their god spoke in their leaders head and told him to harass the hebrews on the way out of Egypt..?\n\nYou can have the last word if you want, but I won't be responding back again on this thread. Thanks for engaging."

Religious or not, there is no evidence that morality has any objective source beyond human enforcement. From what I can tell, morality is a complex behavioural phenomenon that has emerged because we are a social species. That is to say, we have empathy, self-reflection, an aversion to suffering, a sense of fairness, and more that leads us to an ability to evaluate outcomes of behaviours and prescribe recommended standards of behaviour.\n\nEven with the claim of a supernatural source of morality, observation shows literally nothing stops a person from acting “immorally”. There are claims they’ll have some retribution after they die, but there is no way to confirm that this actually happens. Not to mention that many religions (Christianity included) don’t actually require moral behaviour to avoid consequences. Often, they attempt to mark the sort of person that lacks empathy or actively seeks unfair advantages over others or whatnot to establish who gets punished or not by requiring that they “truly repent”. Again, none of this actually proves that divine morality establishes any duty to act one way or other."

We see enforcement of morality by humans or no confirmed enforcement. What is the purpose of objective morality, if it has no material effect beyond a post-mortem reflection by an unobserved being? Despite there being a mythical “stick” waiting for those that act immorally, it does not seem to deter even some of those that promote religious institutions from committing terrible acts.

My direct response to you would be: Your question is nonsensical. I don’t mean that to say that I don’t understand what you are getting at, but that you are trying to mix 2 incompatible concepts. “Meaning” is a description of human thoughts. It’s be like trying to ask about an “external, objective imagination” or some other thought process humans experience or think.\n\nIn the simplest sense, the answer to your question is: No, there is no meaning to morality outside of human interests. Morality only applies to humans and they reflect distinctly human (social) interests. We don’t apply the same moral concepts to animals or plants or inanimate objects (though, they aren’t strictly off limits).\n\n> when that moral agent ceases to value, all value ceases to exists\n\nDo you mean to say that if a person chooses not to accept moral values, then (from their perspective) morality ceases to exists? Or are you implicating that moral values can be tossed aside at the whims of anyone that chooses not to accept/believe them? For the first one, we already see evidence of this, in that people regularly behave contrary to moral codes of conduct (with or without supernatural beliefs). It is very possible they perceive there to be no objective moral standard. For the second one, I have to emphasise that human empathy, fairness, aversion to suffering, etc is baked into our biology (to varying degrees, though). You cannot easily change these experience, just like you’d struggle to change when you feel hungry."

We have a survival instinct. And, in fact, much of our behavior is illogical because it's grounded in sometimes clunky results of our evolution. Evolution only produces workable solutions to survival problems.

Atheism can *inform* one's worldview but it is not one.\n\n>Except I would instead say that morality is relative to the observer...not the observed reality itself...only to the one who observes it.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean. I would change that to say morality is relative to the society observing itself.\n\nImagine you had this guy with a funny mustache who convinces his countrymen that some of their population is dangerous and is intent on killing the rest of the population. This weird man is very persuasive and provides fake evidence to back up his claim.  He persuades his countrymen that exterminating this sub-population is vital to the nation's existence (and therefore the moral thing to do).\n\nSo, they round the others up and kill them.  Now, the people believed they were basing this action on observed reality. However, they were tricked by the man with the funny mustache. So, it's possible people can do what most of us would think is bad because they have inaccurate information but nonetheless think they are behaving morally.  I'm sure the Inquisitors sincerely believed they were behaving morally by killing heretics in order to stop them from further sin."

The proof is not what's required, just logical consistency.\n\nThe user you're replying is really just challenging you to create formal logic statements about morality, which is pretty difficult without a non-naturalistic moral source (not impossible, I'll admit).\n\nFor the Christian, it's pretty trivial:\n\n1. God exists as described biblically, so:\n2. Mankind is made in God's image and holds authority over creation but not over themselves, so:\n3. Holding authority of identity (i.e. the modern conception of slavery) over another human is to deny their ontology;\n4. Which is to deny God's perfect purpose and creative ability;\n5. Which means that such an action is evil (evil in this case being defined as actions not of God, which is tautological and I get that some people have issues with this but that's a separate and different problem).\n\nAnother different problem is that obviously the Old Testament references slavery perpetrated by the Israelites (and other nations). The debate around whether those references constitute condoning slavery, or otherwise, is another different argument (and one that would make different parts of the Bible inconsistent in tone and message, but not heavily undermine the formulation above)."

    "text": "okay so in terms of the Christian mythos, 'goodness' is an inherent aspect of who God is - that is to say, God *is* goodness. This is relative to reality itself, because all of reality is His creation. That means - everything 'good' in creation is good because he made it so, and everything 'bad' or 'evil' is that way because it somehow defies him. As the story in Genesis (the first book of the Bible) goes, all of Creation 'falls' from its perfect goodness into 'the curse of sin', like this:\n\n1. God gives humanity authority over the rest of creation (the earth, plants, animals, whatever)\n2. Humanity eats the fruit, committing the first and only possible sin (doing the one thing that God told them they could not do), and in doing so begin to hide from God - because God is goodness, this means they begin to hide from 'goodness' itself and descend into sin\n3. God confronts their sin and says \"uh okay what's happened here\", effectively giving them a chance to reconcile\n4. Adam blames Eve rather than taking responsibility along with her\n5. It all goes to shit\n\nThe aftermath is that humanity - and the rest of creation - no longer understands God (goodness), and is in fact kinda hostile towards Him. However, this doesn't mean that creation is singly bad - it's still been created by God, and retains an innate sense of and ability for goodness. Everything is just flawed, and flawed enough that it can't get better by itself.\n\n> Surely that is equally just an idea in his consciousness\n\nYes, it is, but unlike us, the Christian God is able to make arbitrarily powerful moral actions with the power of perfect foresight. (The first moral action he takes is to create 'good' things and beings during the act of Creation.) To this end, humanity's different moralities (Christians and non-Christians alike) are differently flawed copies of His - we just lack the will to exert our morality, the foresight to ensure that our actions actually are the *most* moral, and the depth of love required to ensure that our actions aren't just secretly selfish.\n\nTo build upon this further, Christians believe that God is not only perfectly good, but the ultimate and only true source of goodness. That's why (good) Christians will often attribute any charity or outwardly good social act of theirs to His influence.\n\nIt's probably quite an alien viewpoint from the perspective of an atheist, and I can absolutely sympathise with that."

I'm asking you to make a purely logical argument, and you're trying to sneak in another subjective value judgment.\n\nIf you want to argue that morality helps the human race to survive, then that's fine, that can be demonstrated...but in order to be purely logical you would need to prove logically that the human race ought to survive first."

God created evil, so he let it run free so he can have them all killed?\n\nYour god seems to  make a lot of mistakes that he needs to \"correct\" in the most evil and disgusting way possible.
