We have plenty of evidence for god. There are hundreds of arguments, that are supported by science and logic that show it’s more likely that a god does exist. To pretend those don’t exist is silly.\n\n> We have actual evidence that stars form from stellar nurseries with gas and swirling and powerful forces that don't require the existence of a deity.\n\nSo you’ve moved it back one step. Where did the stellar nurseries come from?\n\nYou have no objective truth that says God does not exist.\n\nThere is evidence, hypothesis, and logic that come together to say that God does exist. Or at the very least it’s more probable that God exists."

Read it again. I said there are arguments that are supported by science.\n\nIt doesn’t matter if the vast majority of scientists are atheists. That’s an appeal to an authority and one that doesn’t even work as theology and religion aren’t the domains of science.\n\nThe majority of philosophers of religion are theists. So the people actually in the field that is relevant.\n\nOnly laymen believe in theism? Try again. The fathers of modern science mostly believe in theism. Many scientist working in very advanced fields are theists. Try again.\n\nHow clearly is it? Again, atheism is in the minority in the world. Many high level scientists are theists, most of the philosophers of religion are theists.\n\nI don’t believe ancient folklore proves magic real. You have no idea why I believe in God, you’re assuming and asserting things without evidence. That means it can be dismissed without evidence according to Hitchens."

    "text": "You either made an ad populum fallacy or you were appealing to authority. Take your pick. My point was just so that you noticed you did. We can both do that but obviously to you it only counts when you do it. When I do it, it's fallacious.\n\n> None, there are none.\n\nMaybe you disagree with them, but to pretend they don't exist is nonsense. You mentioned the Kalam and say it is easily dismantled and only fools look at it and count it as evidence. However, it's been one of the most discussed arguments in philosophy. There have been back and forths on it for decades and people are still arguing today. Yet you can just handwave it away. Convenient.\n\n> Wow, indoctrinated people study what they're indoctrinated into?\n\nAgain, you can easily dismiss my appeal to authority, but when you do it, it counts.\n\n> People in history and now being religious has no bearing on its truth and only speaks to how dangerous it was to not be religious before we were enlightened. You're trapped in the dark ages.\n\nI guess all of these people are fools then? The fathers of modern science, all of the advanced science theists today? Just fools? But you, you have it totally figured out and completely proven (of which you've given no support that God can't exist)\n\n> Professional philosophers are not convinced by word games.\n\nAgain, the Kalam is still debated...atheist and theist philosophers are still debating this, same for plenty of other arguments.\n\n> The people born and raised in a religion who hold it tightly despite a godless world.\n\nSo all theistic scientists were just born and raised in it? You have any type of data to back that claim? Or just another assertion without evidence?\n\n[This article](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2009/11/05/scientists-and-belief/) (granted it's a little dated) states that:\n\n> According to the poll, just over half of scientists (51%) believe in some form of deity or higher power; specifically, 33% of scientists say they believe in God, while 18% believe in a universal spirit or higher power.\n\nBut again, who cares what percentage of scientists are theists. That doesn't change the fact that there are arguments based on science, like the argument from the applicability of mathematics, many cosmological arguments, the digital physics argument, etc.\n\n> You have christian in your flair, the entite basis for christianity is ancient folklore. You can try to lie and pretend but it's on display.\n\nI'm a Christian, I believe in the Bible. You said I believe ancient folklore proves magic is real to me. That's not true. Those are two separate things."
