We know souls are in hell because Christ told us so on many occasions, but He also repeatedly told us about the mercy of God.\n\nChrist used the example of the good Samaritan... who wasn't a Jew, who wasn't a follower of Christ (at least we don't know) to prove a point.... That this Samaritan, this foreigner, this non-believer, was the one truly living \"Christ-like.\"\n\nIt is very possible that souls who never converted to Christianity are in heaven."

Also, y'all just pick and choose what you want to follow and what you don't? So you can choose to be shitty and call people names and I can have sex with women. Which one of us will go to hell? Why not both if we're both sinning? Last I heard all sin is equal in God's eyes. Or do you just not believe in that because that would mean you're eternally damned??\n\n\nSee you in Hell, asshole."

    "text": "2 years late but man, it sure can hurt. God doesn't ask you to just fight a physical battle, He wants you to be spiritually sound most of all. 1 Corinthians 6:18, \"Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a person commits are outside the body, but whoever sins sexually, sins against their own body.\"Though yeah, I understand where you're coming from; directly, it doesn't seem to hurt anyone. But I have to ask, though it doesn't seem like it hurts anyone, do you know for certain that it doesn't hurt your mind?\n\nI'd like to bring up some statistics. In a poll conducted by the Oregon State University before LGBTQ+ identities were sensationalized, an outstandingly higher rate of childhood sexual abuse (roughly 20%) was observed among homosexuals than heterosexuals. Similar findings have been reported by the National Library of Medicine, linked alongside the OSU link below.I think that shows more signs of a poor mental state and unhealthily processed trauma.\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9127231/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9127231/)\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11501300/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11501300/)\n\n[https://today.oregonstate.edu/archives/2008/dec/high-rates-childhood-sexual-abuse-contributing-factor-spread-hiv](https://today.oregonstate.edu/archives/2008/dec/high-rates-childhood-sexual-abuse-contributing-factor-spread-hiv)\n\nNot to mention, a focus on sexuality is not really a great thing to be in favor of. Historically there's been a trend of large nations coming to their peak and then falling, coincidentally alongside what I'll refer to as \"sexual liberation\" movements, which focused on making sexual encounters a thing of no matter and essentially devaluing it (higher rates of prostitution, broader acceptance of fetishes and sexual abnormalities in the public eye, etc.) This trend seems to have occurred in the Roman Empire, Greece, and Weimar Germany, among many others. It seems like similar is happening across the western world, with nations like the U.S experiencing consistent (although currently mild) stress due to the disagreements over the issue. Though it seems to be heading in the direction of more turbulent times in my opinion, that's my speculation. The issue in America does still deserve to be viewed as exactly that; an issue. However, the future is never certain, and this could go any way.\n\nAs I know I've brought up only a few on a select focus, I could bring up numerous other stats at your request should you be still interested in this subject. If not, I understand I've replied to a two year old post, and what happens is what happens. You may have changed your view by now, you may have fastened to it further, you may have lost interest in having these views totally. But this is an opinion so many people hold on so many superficial and emotional arguments, that I believe needs to be combated, as it does not do anyone any good. Bottom line is, consent doesn't mean good."

The Flood was because everyone was completely evil except for Noah who was not even that good but still not completely evil (also the Nephilim in the Book of Enoch). The Midianites for heresy. Atheists are just weak-willed and are easily swayed by Satan's lies. But they will only suffer in the end."

It was used as a dump, and a place to dump corpses in Jesus time.\n\nWhen Christ comes back and all are judged at the Great White throne those who receive their second death will be cast into Gahennaa. There was smoke and flame there from burning garbage in Jesus time.\n\nYou will receive instant death and be cast into Gahenna. No eternal torment ect...and as Paul tells us you will eventually be resurrected and receive eternal life through Christ on the cross.\n\nTo further back up my claim of mis-translation of Gahenna...I have included this:\n\n\"It is difficult to definitively determine how 'Hades' came to be associated with the concept 'hell.' The most common theory is that the Latin word infernum carried the idea of divine punishment and gradually came to be confused with the distinct concepts of γέεννα (Gehenna), ταρταρόω (Tartaroo/us), and ᾅδης (Hades). The King James Version of the Bible then followed suit, having long forgotten the distinction between the terms, and translated all of them as 'hell.'\"\n\nhttps://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/5146/why-is-had%C4%93s-translated-as-hell"
