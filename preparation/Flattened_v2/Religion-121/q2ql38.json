    "text": "> our entire ecosystem is so co dependent and fragile that it basically all had to appear at once\n\nA complex system of codependencies is *exactly* what you would expect from evolution. Changing conditions create exploitable niches that life evolves into, which creates other exploitable niches for other life to evolve into.\n\n> Micro evolution is definitely real but If macro evolution was real then there’d be tons of transitional species and billions of transitional fossils but there isn’t. Like at all.\n\nIt is literally not possible for you to be more wrong. Every single fossil that exists is a transitional fossil, and every living thing is a transitional species. Not understanding this fact speaks to a fundemental misunderstanding of what evolution is. It's an equivalently dire misunderstanding as someone claiming that statistics is BS because the chance of something happening is always 50% \"because it either happens or it doesn't\", like, just an absolutely basic confusion about the facts.\n\n> I mean just observe the human body or an animal for a few seconds or even a tree\n\n\"It obvious!\" is not an argument, neither are your intuitions, neither are your feelings. Natural selection is a plausible explanation for the *appearance* of conscious design in the natural world, so you cannot appeal to that appearance as a refutation of it. You need to do better than this."
