    "text": "You haven't demonstrated that atheism can be as toxic as any religion, you've only demonstrated that their are toxic atheists.\n\nWell -- yeah -- obviously.  People don't just stop being toxic because they haven't been convinced a God exists.\n\nAtheism isn't toxic at all, not even 1%.  It's just the concept of not believing a God exists.  There's no book of rules or expectations or standard of morals or anything.  It's no more toxic than not believing Pro Wrestling is real.\n\nDoes that mean somebody can't be a toxic jerk about how fake wrestling is?  Of course.  People are toxic.\n\nHowever, your post doesn't demonstrate anything about atheism being toxic.  You're just talking about individual atheists who are acting on their own impulses and preferences and emotions and sense of ethics.  None of that can be blamed on atheism.\n\nHowever, when a Christian parent disowns their gay child, this *CAN* be blamed on Christianity.  When a wife is treated like property, this *CAN* be blamed on Christianity.  When somebody goes to another country and kidnaps a bunch of people to beat and enslave, this *CAN* be blamed on Christianity.  When somebody fails to wash their hands before preparing food, this *CAN* be blamed on Christianity.\n\nI'm not necessarily aware of a religion that doesn't have some type of text associated with it, which tells people how they're supposed to act.  As far as I can tell, that's a feature in just about every single religion.  To some degree.  However, atheism has exactly zero degree of that.  It's just a word we use to describe somebody who *doesn't* follow an alleged holy book.  And there's nothing whatsoever toxic about not following an alleged holy book."

    "text": "> Christianity doesn’t say parents should disown their children. So how is that Christianity’s fault?\n\nYou're right, it doesn't say parents are supposed to disown their children.  It says that gay people are arrogant and boastful, murderous, deceitful, incapable of love, incapable of mercy, incapable of understanding, incapable of doing anything good, full of envy and malice, full of every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity, that they gossip and slander, disobey their parents, and even invent ways to do evil.  It says that they deserve death, and that it is the responsibility of their community to put them to death in order to purge evil from amongst them.  You're right, though -- it doesn't say to disown them, merely to consider them an abomination and put them to death.\n\nHowever, most Christians are like the rest of us, in that they are aware that they will go to prison if they kill someone, and in that they have an extreme aversion to killing their own chidlren (or anybody else, for that matter).  So instead of taking their children outside and gathering the town to throw rocks at their faces until they die of brain damage, they just disown them.\n\nFun fact -- while people commonly say that the Bible doesn't actually say anything about trans people, it *does* specifically say that God detests anyone who wears clothing inteneded for the opposite gender.  So there's a Biblical basis for transphobia as well.\n\n> Christianity doesn’t command people to no wash hands.\n\nYou're right, it doesn't -- Jesus just yells at the Pharisees for washing their hands before they eat.  He tells them that anyone who washes their hands before they eat is a fool because nothing that goes into your mouth can make you unclean.  He also goes on to chastise them for failing to kill their own children, and basically says \"no wonder your children are so rude and disrespectful, you guys don't kill your children when they disobey.\"  Jesus and his Dad were apparently *really into* people killing their own children."

    "text": ">  it doesn’t say that either.\n\nKind of weird to assert that a book that big *doesn't* say something.  Do you have the whole thing committed to memory?  See, if somebody told me the Bible said something I didn't think it said, I wouldn't simply assert that it didn't say so -- I would ask them *where* it says that (especially if the conversation were taking place in a debate forum).  This way, if I'm wrong, I don't look like a fool; meanwhile, if I'm *right,* then *they* end up looking like a fool.\n\nI'll be sure to include the *entire* passage, so I'm not accused of taking anything out of context.\n\nRomans 1:18-32 *God's Wrath Against Sinful Humanity*\n\n> The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness, since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.\n\n> For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles.\n\n> Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised. Amen.\n\n> Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.\n\n> Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, so God gave them over to a depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done. They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; they have no understanding, no fidelity, no love, no mercy. Although they know God’s righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.\n\nAs you can see, it says exactly what I alleged it did.  Why would I make up something so specific?  Also, there's Leviticus 20:13, but I'm sure you're well aware of that one, and would probably just chalk it up to an old covenant.  No need to go down that path, we can stay focused on Romans as it is in the New Testament.\n\n> no, that’s not what happened. They were critiquing Jesus and his apostles for washing to their wrist, when they washed to elbows. Jesus then pointed out that washing hands doesn’t determine holiness, but what’s in the heart does.\n\nI'm unfamiliar with it saying Jesus washed his hands up to his wrist.  I cannot find this portion of the Bible.  Can you please provide the exact text which says that Jesus washed his hands up to his wrist?\n\nEither way, he still said that anyone who thinks something going into your mouth can defile you or make you unclean is dull and that the Pharisees have offended God by failing to kill their children.\n\nI'm much less interested in whether or not Jesus wanted Christians to refrain from washing their hands and much more interested in why you don't think the Bible says to kill gay people, when it so obviously does.\n\nYou know that you can just say you disagree with the Bible -- right?  Like you're not obligated to make everything in it fit your own personal sense of ethics.  You can just say that you disagree with some of the things it says.  There's no reason you have to agree with everything or even anything it says.  Cause like -- it says what it says.  Choosing to twist it's words and meaning into unrecognizable forms isn't going to fool the people who wrote it... I don't see why people can't just say \"Yeah you're right actually, the Bible does say that -- that's pretty horrendous and I don't agree with it.\""

And not people in invincible ignorance?\n\nCan you provide the text which says any of that?\n\n> And there were two schools of thought, pharases, which Jesus was, washed up to the wrist, saducees, washed up to the elbow.\n\nAccording to the text, it was the Pharisees and not the Sadducees.  The text doesn't say anything about only washing your hands up to the wrist, it says that only somebody dull would think they need to wash their hands before they eat because you don't have to worry about anything that goes into your mouth.\n\n> And it says that the punishment due to ALL sin is death.\n\nAnother part of the Bible says that, to be sure, but the part of the Bible I was talking about was being more specific.\n\n> So gay people aren’t to be put to death any more so then adulterers.\n\nAdulterers are supposed to be put to death in one of the most horrific manners of execution ever devised by God or man.  Just like rape victims!\n\n> Jesus accused lust in the heart to be just as bad as rape.\n\nWell, considering that the Bible allows for you to kill a woman's parents, kidnap her, strip her naked, shave her head, hold her hostage, and then force her to have sex with you and be your wife.  You're even allowed to change your mind and decide you don't want her to be your wife afterward if you want.  So I'm not very surprised that Jesus thought rape was equally bad to thinking sexy thoughts -- the Bible considered rape to be mostly fine, while sexy thoughts were considered to be a serious crime.  So that all checks out.\n\nThank goodness we don't still live by Jesus's standards.  Horriffic.  Imagine considering somebody a bad person for thinking about pleasuring somebody else, but considering a person who killed, kidnapped, and raped good.  The Bible presents one of the most twisted and perverse standards of ethics I've ever encountered.  Legitimately.\n\n> Yet I don’t see anyone saying that it means they need to be put to death.\n\nMe either.  It's very rare that I ever see Christians honestly acknowledging what the  Bible actually says.  They're usually either ignoring stuff that is there or adding stuff that isn't.\n\n> There’s a difference between an act deserving a particular consequence and us being called to enact that consequence.\n\nFor sure.  Which is why God made sure to mention several times in the Bible how important it was that his followers kill gay people.  God specifically said that it was our responsibility to kill gay people.\n\nRegardless, let's pretend he didn't.  Let's pretend he only told us to kill adulterers and rape victims and people who curse their parents and etc etc etc but never said to kill gay people.  Or let's pretend Jesus actually said not to follow those rules anymore and pretend he didn't say to follow the rules until the world doesn't exist anymore.\n\nIn this scenario, God is still saying that people who engage in homosexual activity are arrogant and boastful, murderous, deceitful, incapable of love, incapable of mercy, incapable of understanding, incapable of doing anything good, full of envy and malice, full of every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity, that they gossip and slander, disobey their parents, and even invent ways to do evil, and that they deserve to die for being so.  Therefore you can absolutely blame Christianity when a parent disowns their child for being gay."

Disowning a child for being gay is cruel and childish and unloving.  Should parents be cruel and childish and unloving?

From the Spanish Republics, to the Soviets, to the communist Chinese, Vietnamese, Cambodians, North Koreans, and Laotians. There is also all of Eastern Europe when it was communist. The same exact things happened under the communist and socialist regimes in Africa, such as in Ethiopia and Somalia.\n\nThis phenomenon is not restricted to communist regimes. Revolutionary France was highly atheistic, with the creation of a cult of reason. There was extreme violence against clergy and the religious. Such violence was similar during the Mexican Revolution. Nicaragua today is persecuting Christians and has a violent, anti religious government. Everywhere state atheism has been practiced, large numbers of people were murdered.\n\n>It doesn't assume that.

Any immoral or evil person can do good, but this does not overrule or erase the evil they do.\n\n>My bad, perhaps you live in a different area of the world than me. You should look up the history of the United States if you think I'd be hard pressed to find an exampe of that.\n\nWhere in U.S history do you see people traveling to other lands and enslaving them because of Christianity? We can see examples of people justifying their enslavement of others using Christianity, but the underlying motives for slavery were profit. Nobody would be enslaving people if it did not bring significant material benefits to themselves. Remove the material benefits from the equation, and the justifications using Christianity would not be adequate enough for people to continue the practice of slavery.\n\nThis can be seen in many ways. For instance, the Catholic Church condemned to enslavement of natives by the Spanish on many occasions, with Pope Paul III issuing 3 Papal Bulls against such practices. Catholic religious orders, such as the Dominicans and Franciscans began refusing absolution of sins and giving of communion to those who refused to heed the Papal instructions. Advocacy from the clergy led to the \"New Laws\" in 1542, which officially ended slavery of Indians. These laws were a failure however, as they were impossible to enforce due to extreme hostility. There were attacks on clergy and even Spanish officials who attempted to enforce such laws.  In these cases, we can see that even with Papal and Church condemnation of the practice, along with religious and monastic orders working against such practices, people still engaged in slavery because it was so beneficial to them materially."

Because the Rastafarians say that the reason they do it is because they're following the Biblical God.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't blame Christianity for people smoking weed, because the book doesn't actually say to do that.  Just because one group of Christians do it doesn't mean it's necessarily encouraged by the belief system.  The Bible says to kill people for being gay, but it doesn't say to smoke weed.\n\nAtheism doesn't have any commandments, so I don't see how this is at all equivalent.  A person can be an atheist and do anything they want.  A person can be black and do anything they want.  A person can be a Star Wars fan and do anything they want.  But if a person is a Christian they have certain rules they're expected to follow.\n\nTherefore it makes sense to blame Christianity when a Christian does what the Christian rules say to do.  It doesn't make sense to blame blackness when a black person does what they personally want to do, and it doesn't make sense to blame atheism when an atheist does what they personally want to do.  These are different things.\n\n> The fact that every single regime that has been explicitly atheist has also been extraordinarily murderous and tyrannical seems to suggest that there is more to atheism than just non believing in God.\n\nLol no it doesn't.

My definition of treating a romantic partner well necessitates respect, which isn't possible when you consider somebody else to be your property and inferior to you and of less value.\n\nIt is only because of Christianity that women are valued as they are. Christianity's spread of Monogamy is perhaps the most important change ever made in terms of elevating a woman's value. A massive body of research has shown that monogamous societies have much lower rates of maternal mortality, much lower rates of sexual and physical abuse of women, lower rates of neglect, much lower rates of crime, such as sexual assault, rape, murder, and kidnapping than polygamous societies.\n\nMonogamous societies have vastly more stable and safer marital and family dynamics than polygamous societies as well. Risks of divorce and abandonment are lower for women in monogamous societies than polygamous societies.  Studies have also shown that women in monogamous marriages have much better mental and physical health than women in non monogamous relationships, regardless of which country or culture this is in.\n\nChristianity is also responsible for ending countless abuses against women. Some of these, such as burning widows to death or killing them when their husbands died, I already mentioned. Other examples include criminalizing sex slavery, which was very prevalent in most societies before the spread of Christianity. The criminalization of prostitution is another example, as prostitution is a significant driver of sex slavery and abuse, as well as being destructive to society in general. It is also because of the spread of Christianity that the practice of infanticide was banned in many cultures. Infanticide was once very common among most societies, with girls bearing the brunt of infanticide, as a daughter was often less valued than a son. The practice of exposure/abandonment, which was also very common, was also heavily directed against daughters instead of sons. As Christianity spread, such practices were forbidden.\n\n>The part in Mark where Jesus tells the Pharisees it's foolish to wash their hands before they eat is just one of my favorite parts of the Bible because it's just so ridiculous.\n\nWhat is ridiculous about this passage?

    "text": ">Preposturous. Matriarchal societies existed before Christianity. Women were considered equal under the law in Egypt. This is patently untrue.\n\n\n\nWhat are these supposed matriarchal societies? At the very most, there are a very small number of isolated cultures that practice matriarchy. At the least, they are small matrilineal societies. The overwhelming majority of societies were patriarchal, polygamous societies. It is precisely because of the spread of Christianity that polygamy has declined in most of the world. Because of this, the standard of living for women and the treatment of women has vastly improved. The spread of monogamy and the decline of polygamy is arguably the largest improvement of conditions for women in history, and is the basis for much of their gains.\n\nThe Christian redefinition of adultery also significantly benefitted women. In most societies, adultery was only committed when a man had sex with another married woman. A married man could have sex with any non married woman. This of course highly disadvantaged women while allowing husbands to devote considerable resources and attention to mistresses and prostitutes. Forcing husbands to remain committed to their wives and requiring them to be loyal and provide for them greatly increased standards of living for women.\n\nThe heavy discouragement and eventual prohibitions against prostitution that were brought about by Christianity played a major role in reducing sex slavery, which was an extremely common institution in Rome and much of the world. As slavery as a whole was largely abolished in Europe by the High Middle Ages, the enslavement of women for sex dropped dramatically. While Europeans did practice slavery in their new colonies, this was condemned by the Catholic Church. When looking at the world today, the countries were there is little sex slavery are historically Christian countries, while countries with high amounts of sex slavery are mostly Islamic and other non Christian countries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You don't see how anyone could interpret it that way? That's very odd. Of course somebody could interpret it that way. Imagine a child, for example, if it's really hard for you to wrap your head around somebody interperting Jesus's words the way he said them.\n\nTo put it in layman's terms, I do not see how any reasonable adult, teen, or older child could possibly interpret what is being said as a command to not wash hands. If any child believed this, it is very likely that they would be quickly corrected by their parents or other adult when they refused to wash their hands because Jesus said not to. The only people I have ever heard make this argument are those who intentionally (on purpose) misrepresent what is said in order to argue against Christians."

At the least, they are small matrilineal societies.\n\nYeah.  Sadly, most of them were wiped out or forcefully converted by patriarchal groups like Christianity, who considered women to be the property of men as well as of less value of men and unworthy of social autonomy, equal legal rights, teaching others, holding authority, or speaking in church.\n\n> It is precisely because of the spread of Christianity that polygamy has declined in most of the world.\n\nOrgiastic societies tended to care more about one another and treat childcare as a communal responsibility.\n\nI'm not advocating for an orgiastic society, I'm just saying, let's not pretend this was some case of a morally superior system replacing a morally inferior system.  It was just another morally depraved system that forced itself upon other people via dominance and bloodshed.\n\n> The spread of monogamy and the decline of polygamy is arguably the largest improvement of conditions for women in history, and is the basis for much of their gains.\n\nEntirely disagree.  Women's suffrage was much better than the destruction of indigenous cultures and spread of Christian patriarchal monogamy.\n\nImagine buying a human being from her father and considering yourself morally superior to anybody.\n\n> The Christian redefinition of adultery also significantly benefitted women.\n\nIt absolutely did not.  The idea that merely thinking about adultery constitutes adultery has been one of the most psychologically damaging contributions of Christianity to the modern world, to both men and women.  The amount damage its done is literally so large it is unquantifiable.\n\n> In most societies, adultery was only committed when a man had sex with another married woman. A married man could have sex with any non married woman. This of course highly disadvantaged women while allowing husbands to devote considerable resources and attention to mistresses and prostitutes. Forcing husbands to remain committed to their wives and requiring them to be loyal and provide for them greatly increased standards of living for women.\n\nI never said that Christianity doesn't have some standards which are technically \"better\" than other standards, but they're still absurdly ignorant, animalistic standards which need to be recognized as such and moved away from.\n\n> The heavy discouragement and eventual prohibitions against prostitution that were brought about by Christianity played a major role in reducing sex slavery\n\nChristianity's persecution of prostitution was not a good thing.  Look at the way people talk about enterprising OnlyFans models and performers.  The way we treat sex work and women's sexuality is abhorrent, and Christianity is the standard we were appealing to when we developed these attitudes.  It's disgusting.\n\nJesus even says that he's going to kill a prostitute's children as revenge for her sex work, and that everyone will see him kill those children and will know that he is top dog.\n\nDisgusting.\n\n> Christianity played a major role in reducing sex slavery\n\nNo it doesn't.\n\nAccording to Christianity, women are the property of men and can be bought and sold to then be obligated to have sex with you on your terns, aren't allowed any agency in the matter, and must obey the man who bought her as men obey Jesus.  This is called a sex slave.  You can call it a \"wife\" if you want, but you're reducing the word \"wife\" to a synonym for \"sex slave.\"\n\nI particularly \"like\" the part where you're allowed (some would say encouraged) to go to another country, kill a girl's parents, kidnap her, strip her naked, shave her head, hold her hostage, rape her, and then choose to either keep her as your \"wife\" or kick her out of your house.\n\nWhat a lovely book.\n\n> As slavery as a whole was largely abolished in Europe by the High Middle Ages, the enslavement of women for sex dropped dramatically.\n\nI get it.  Christians don't take the Bible seriously and more often than not directly ignore what it says.  The Bible was very clear about slavery being a righteous institution and how it's a perfectly fine thing to go to other nations, kidnap people and force them to be your slaves, beat them, etc etc.  I don't know why they'd ban something the Bible glowingly endorses as if getting rid of slavery was some type of Christian imperative.  It wasn't.  Even the New Testament was abundantly clear that God endorses and encourages slavery and wants people to do it a certain way.\n\nThat's why the American slave trade happened -- the Bible said \"hey guys you should go do this\" and America said \"okay God, you're the boss, we will now go do as you suggested.\"\n\n> While Europeans did practice slavery in their new colonies, this was condemned by the Catholic Church.\n\nThe Catholic Church, who adopted a platform of non-involvement during the holocaust, when God's chosen people were being exterminated?  The Catholic Church, who stockpiles riches and builds giant glittering palaces of gold while people starve to death?  The Catholic Church, who catches men lying with boys as they would a woman, and instead of bludgeoning them to death in order to frighten the rest of the nation, as the Apostle Paul commands in the New Testament , they harbor and protect them from consequences for their actions?\n\nWhy should I be surprised that the Catholic Church, like most Christian organizations, doesn't actually take the Bible as seriously as they claim to?\n\n> When looking at the world today, the countries were there is little sex slavery are historically Christian countries, while countries with high amounts of sex slavery are mostly Islamic and other non Christian countries.\n\nSource?\n\n> To put it in layman's terms, I do not see how any reasonable adult, teen, or older child could possibly interpret what is being said as a command to not wash hands.\n\nIt wasn't a command, I agree!  Jesus said that it was foolish to wash your hands before eating, and said that people who do so are dull.  So while I agree that it wouldn't be interpreted as a *command,* I do see how followers and worshipers of Christ who wish to court his favor and live by his example might refrain from doing things which he looks down upon and considers foolish.\n\n> If any child believed this, it is very likely that they would be quickly corrected by their parents or other adult when they refused to wash their hands because Jesus said not to.\n\nI agree.  And if any child buried a rape victim up to their neck and started throwing stones at their face, trying to kill them, I would hope their parents would stop them.  I am aware that most Christians tend not to take the Bible very seriously, at least not compared to actual ethics and actual common sense.\n\n> The only people I have ever heard make this argument are those who intentionally (on purpose) misrepresent what is said in order to argue against Christians.\n\nI have not misrepresented what was said at all.  Here is Mark 7 in it's entirety (NIV) --\n\n> The Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus 2 and saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were defiled, that is, unwashed. 3 (The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing, holding to the tradition of the elders. 4 When they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash. And they observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pitchers and kettles.[a])\n\n> 5 So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, “Why don’t your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with defiled hands?”\n\n> 6 He replied, “Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written:\n\n> “‘These people honor me with their lips,\n>   but their hearts are far from me.\n> 7 They worship me in vain;\n>    their teachings are merely human rules.’\n\n> 8 You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to human traditions.”\n\n> 9 And he continued, “You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe[c] your own traditions! 10 For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and mother,’[d] and, ‘Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death.’[e] 11 But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their father or mother is Corban (that is, devoted to God)— 12 then you no longer let them do anything for their father or mother. 13 Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that.”\n\n> 14 Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said, “Listen to me, everyone, and understand this. 15 Nothing outside a person can defile them by going into them. Rather, it is what comes out of a person that defiles them.”\n\n> 17 After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable. 18 “Are you so dull?” he asked. “Don’t you see that nothing that enters a person from the outside can defile them? 19 For it doesn’t go into their heart but into their stomach, and then out of the body.” (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods clean.)\n\n> 20 He went on: “What comes out of a person is what defiles them. 21 For it is from within, out of a person’s heart, that evil thoughts come—sexual immorality, theft, murder, 22 adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly. 23 All these evils come from inside and defile a person.”"

Sadly, most of them were wiped out or forcefully converted by patriarchal groups like Christianity, who considered women to be the property of men as well as of less value of men and unworthy of social autonomy, equal legal rights, teaching others, holding authority, or speaking in church.\n\n1.Christianity did not consider women the property of men.\n\n2. There is significant debate as to whether there were any matriarchal societies at all. Among those who believe there were such societies, there were very few of them and they were very small.\n\n3. Patriarchy is the natural order for human society. It is a good thing, although it can be perverted and twisted, as has been done by so many societies.\n\n>Orgiastic societies tended to care more about one another and treat childcare as a communal responsibility.\n\n>I'm not advocating for an orgiastic society, I'm just saying, let's not pretend this was some case of a morally superior system replacing a morally inferior system. It was just another morally depraved system that forced itself upon other people via dominance and bloodshed.\n\nIts pretty clear that monogamy is far morally superior to polygamy. Studies have consistently shown, and historical research has backed it up, that polygamous societies have much higher infant mortality, child mortality, and maternal mortality rates than monogamous societies. They have vastly higher rates of in family conflict, violence, abuse, murder, jealousy, etc. Children from monogamous societies have higher education levels and better health and nutrition. Women and children in monogamous societies have vastly better mental and emotional health. Monogamous societies have much less crime, violence, warfare, and drug and alcohol abuse.\n\nIf we want to look specifically at orgiastic societies, they fare abominably. Such societies have a prevalence of infanticide, abortion, contraceptive use, child abandonment/exposure, divorce, and low birth rates. In such societies, ritual and cultic prostitution was extremely common, as was general prostitution. Regardless of the type, the vast majority of women who were prostitutes were slaves. The orgiastic society ran on mass scale sex slavery and exploitation. Contrast this with a monogamous society which views marriage as sacred. Such a society sees much lower rates of prostitution and sex slavery, in large part due to more men being married and there being a greater commitment to marriage. Divorce was extremely easy in Rome and other orgiastic societies, which more often than not led to women being abandoned to poverty. Christianity's restriction of divorce greatly alleviated this problem. The problems with such a society are innumerable.\n\n>Entirely disagree. Women's suffrage was much better than the destruction of indigenous cultures and spread of Christian patriarchal monogamy.\n\nWomen's suffrage is only possible in a largely monogamous society. You think women will have suffrage in a society where powerful men try to add as many women to their harem as possible? Regardless of any of this, complete suffrage was a disaster, although the same can be said for expanding suffrage to the entirety of the male population.\n\n>It absolutely did not. The idea that merely thinking about adultery constitutes adultery has been one of the most psychologically damaging contributions of Christianity to the modern world, to both men and women. The amount damage its done is literally so large it is unquantifiable.\n\nImagine thinking people should be loyal and faithful to their spouses, so horrible. Everything you said is not based in fact. Before Christianity, a man could be married and have has many mistresses as he wanted and see as many prostitutes as he wanted, as long as it was not with another man's wife. Christianity applied adultery to men, forcing them to be loyal and faithful to their wives instead of tolerating a culture that was monogamous in name only and polygamous in practice.\n\nTo test the hypothesis regarding thinking about adultery constituting adultery, I think studies around porn use will be good. Numerous studies have shown that heavy porn users get divorced at much higher rates than light porn users, who get divorced at much higher rates than those who do not use porn. Increased porn use is strongly linked to increased likelihood for divorce. Increased porn use is also linked to a much higher likelihood of having an affair. New studies are emerging that suggest that porn use may have a strong effect on the decline of marriage rates. If viewing people for sexual pleasure causes all this trouble, it seems thinking these thoughts in your head would do the same."

    "text": ">What is a \"natural order for society?\" I don't think you understand how nature works or how society works.\n\nThe natural order for society is the way in which human society is rightly ordered according to mans nature. Considering that almost all or every single society in human history has been ordered this way, it is definitely how society works.\n\n>All of this is focusing on one little aside in order to avoid engaging with my point. Christianity is a barbaric ideology and there is no reasonable place for it in modern society.\n\nYou are just waving aside an extremely important point. Christianity's imposition of monogamy and forbidding of polygamy is one of the most important contributions towards creating a stable and modern civilization. It is extremely highly doubtful that Europe could ever have become nearly as developed as it did had not Christianity come along with monogamy and its many, many benefits.\n\n>You're literally just asserting things. We don't have a monogamous society now, and yet women are allowed to vote. So it looks like you're just wrong.\n\nEvery single society in which women have large amounts of rights and privilege's are historically monogamous societies. Every single society where women are heavily oppressed and mistreated allow or tolerate polygamy. The academic literature is overwhelming on this point as well. It is the academic consensus that monogamy greatly increases the treatment of women and leads to a more equal balance with men.\n\nAs for the claim that our society being non monogamous disproves my claim, there are a couple of problems with this. Firstly, our society is still overwhelmingly monogamous, although serial monogamy has become the norm. Even so, monogamous marriage or relationships are the desire for most people. Secondly, monogamy was the norm in our society for well over 1,000 years, and was still overwhelmingly the norm until a few decades ago. Polygamy is illegal in many places in the western world.\n\n>Lmao, this guy is literally saying that allowing women to vote has been a disaster. Okay bro. Pretty sad. I can't help but wonder if you'd have such a gross bigoted perspective if you didn't follow a book which commanded you to have that perspective.\n\nYou left out the part in which I said expanding voting to most men was also a disaster. When you referenced it later, you implied I only meant felons. When I said most men shouldn't be voting, I meant in it a very literal way. I don't think any group of people should have broad and general suffrage, as it leads to the destruction of all countries that practice it.\n\n>Never said or implied anything like that, such a strawman. So embarrassing that you have to strawman me in order to debate me.\n\nIt was not a strawman, rather it was taking your argument to an absurdity, as it was, at its base, absurd. Christianity forbidding men from lusting after other men's wives and women they are not married to is completely reasonable and is hardly the absurdity you made out out to be.\n\n>False dichotomy, condemning adultery doesn't condemn polygamy.\n\nYou are partly correct, but this was not my point. At this point, I was referring to the nominal monogamy that was practiced by Rome, in which a man could only have one wife, but was allowed to have as many mistresses and prostitutes as he pleased. Christianity forbade this, requiring a man be loyal solely to his wife."

    "text": ">I can find several parts of the Bible which are blatantly outright in support of polygamy. Can you provide me with a single passage from the Bible which condemns polygamy?\n\nFor 2,000 years, the Church has forbidden polygamy. As I asked before, why do you think you know better than 2,000 years of theological discourse and teaching? What insight do you have that St. Augustine or St. Aquinas did not?\n\nMore directly, Genesis 1-2 appears to heavily imply monogamy, as Adam was only given one was, and through sexual relations with her, the 2 would become one flesh, which would exclude other sexual relations. We see that polygamy did not become a thing until several generations later, when an evil man named Lamech took 2 wives. The Pentateuch allowed for polygamy, but it also allowed for divorce, which we see Jesus oppose. With that said, many of the laws and many of the Proverbs and Psalms in the Old Testament seem to assume monogamy. The relationship between God and Israel is depicted as a monogamous marriage. When Israel strayed from God, it was depicted as an adulterous woman or a prostitute. The relationship between Christ and the Church is depicted similarly, as a monogamous marriage. The New Testament and the teachings of Jesus also point towards monogamy as the only acceptable form of marriage.\n\n>The logical leap you just made should be obvious. The fact that higher frequency of porn use was correlated with divorce does not in any way indicate that porn use causes divorce.\n\nIt may not cause divorce, but is is very clearly a contributing factor. As study after study has shown, heavy porn use is linked to much higher rates of divorce than light porn use, which is linked to high rates of divorce than no porn use. Porn use is also linked to more relationship failure in dating relationships as well. Viewing pornography has been linked with a lower likelihood of marriage, while viewing religious sites has been linked with a higher likelihood of marriage. Study after study has shown that people who use porn report lower relationship and sexual satisfaction and contentment than those who do not use porn, while ending porn use is linked with higher relational and sexual satisfaction and contentment.  I think it should be rather obvious that watching other people have sex in order to have sexual satisfaction is not very good for a relationship.\n\nTo more directly answer the question of whether porn use is more than just correlated with relationship breakdown, it is helpful to look at many studies that have shown that relationships tend to decline in quality after one partner discovers the pornography habits of the other partner. Studies have also shown that those who use pornography are more likely to engage in adultery than those who do not. Adultery is one of the major contributing factors of divorce. Porn use is correlated with higher likelihood of cheating on a partner in a dating relationship as well, which is one of the leading factors for breakups among boyfriends and girlfriends. Other studies have shown that those who use pornography are more likely to procure prostitutes, which provides no help and much harm in relationships. From this, it seems to suggest that porn helps to encourage behaviors that negatively affect relationships, which leads to greater break ups and divorces."

In fact, the Catholic Church condemned the African slave trade in the 1500's and 1600's. Abolitionism was an almost exclusively Christian movement.

Not surprisingly, the Catholic Church has consistently condemned slavery for centuries. Also not surprising that slavery virtually ceased to exist among Europeans in the Middle Ages. There are plenty of theological reasons that the Church opposes slavery as well, but they are too long to list out. It really is worth going over however, because making comments that the Church doesn't know what the Bible actually says is just ridiculous.\n\n>The Catholic Church, who adopted a platform of non-involvement during the holocaust, when God's chosen people were being exterminated?\n\nThe Catholic Church, which is responsible for saving tens of thousands of Jews from the Holocaust, including housing many in the Pope's own quarters.

    "text": ">The Catholic Church goes against the Bible all the time.\n\nThat is a pretty bold assertion to make. The fact that the Church is responsible for the near total ending of slavery in Europe by the 1000's, as well as the fact that it condemned the enslavement of Indians as well as the African slave trade in the 1500's suggests that the Church has always been against slavery. The Catholic Church is the oldest and largest form of Christianity. In order to say it goes against the Bible, especially in this instance, you need some outstanding proof.\n\n>That said, glad they're capable of having a stance in atrocities of humanity. Their platform of non-involvement during WWII implied otherwise.\n\nThe Church is responsible for saving the lives of  hundreds of thousands of Jews through hiding them in churches and other Church buildings. This is especially true for Italy, with 85% of the Jewish population surviving, largely due to being hid in monasteries, converts, churches, etc. The Pope himself took in thousands of Jews at his summer residence. As for direct claim that the Church took the path of non intervention or involvement, this is simply not true, as the Pope officially condemned the Nazi's on numerous occasions.\n\n>It was a movement by Christians which undermines their own faith and ideology and implies that they think they know better than their own God and can fix his mistakes.\n\nWhy do you think you know better than Christians as to the issue of slavery? Do you know more than the Popes, priests, and theologians who lived for the past 1,000 years? Do you know more than the Dominican friars (who were among the most learned men in theology in history) who opposed Spanish enslavement of the natives in the America's and succeeded in getting the king to pass the New Laws? What of the Franciscans or Jesuits who also played a role in ending slavery? There are numerous theological arguments against slavery that are all grounded in the Bible. What gives you unique interpretive authority over the Church and centuries of tradition?\n\n>This is not true. The Bible says that you shall take your slaves from the nations that surround you, and even allows you to kidnap wives from the nations you [conquer.tl](http://conquer.tl)\n\nThe Bible contains provisions pertaining solely to the nation of Israel, allowing it to take prisoners of war from enemy nations and enslave them. It also contains provisions allowing the Israelite men to marry captive women and make them part of their family, giving them the status of Israelite women and lesser wife.\n\nWorth noting when discussing slavery is that Israel was unique in the ancient world in its laws towards slavery, as they granted slaves many rights. A slave was to have immediate manumission should they suffer the loss or severe injury of any part of the body, even if it is just a single tooth. As far as I am aware, there were no other societies in history in which slaves were to be granted immediate freedom for what would often be considered minor injuries. Slaves also had the right to not work on the Sabbath. Not many cultures give their slaves a mandatory day of rest from work and duties.\n\nWe can also look at laws forbidding the murder of slaves, meaning slaves had the right to life, which is not something most slaves had in most cultures. It is hard to find any other culture where a master could be executed for killing a slave. Slaves also had the right to sexual integrity, in the sense that it was forbidden to rape a slave, it was forbidden to engage in fornication with a slave, and it was forbidden to commit adultery with a slaves wife. These laws mandate respect for a slaves marriage, family, and bodily integrity. Kidnapping a person and selling them into slavery was also forbidden. This crime was punished by execution, and applied to instances of Israelites kidnapping anybody, whether they are a fellow Israelite or a foreigner.\n\nAll of this is simply touching the surface and does not go into deeper theological arguments as to why slavery is impermissible."
