Why?\n\nUsually because you use unsubstantiated evidence or reference psi-encyclopedia or some similarly pseudo-scientific hack website and are so ignorant of the poor level of substantiation for your claimed evidence that it highlits your inability to distinguish between quacks and mediums and psychics and tarot card readers, thus reminding us all  that there are people who are credulous rubes and marks, ready to be manipulated by any cheap charlatan with a website inundated with psychobable so it sounds smart to fools, and continued advocacy for your unsubstantiated claims of evidence  is an embarrassment to those of us that require evidence to be well substantiated.\n\nThat might be why you're downvoted."

If you think I'm the one that doesn't know what they are talking about, and you are the one that thinks parapsychology is a well-regarded and reputable field, then go get a reputable academic journal that substantiates the solid scientific basis of parapsychology rather than a leading hack who claims it on his own website (and gets  paid money to act like people have supernatural powers and buries people in hyper-specific but unverified meta-analysis and psychobabble).\n\nRadin wants to convince people with average minds that they have supernatural abilities.\n\nI'm unsurprised his little grift has worked on you."

    "text": ">Radin was not discredited\n\nYes, he is.\n\n>, he is attacked frequently and replies to everyone who tries to take down his experiments.\n\n>See here:\n\n>[https://psi-encyclopedia.spr.ac.uk/articles/dean-radin#Scepticism_and_Controversy](https://psi-encyclopedia.spr.ac.uk/articles/dean-radin#Scepticism_and_Controversy)\n\n\nPsi encyclopedia is not a reputable site.\n\n>>The international professional organization for scientists and scholars interested in psi phenomena is the Parapsychological Association, an elected affiliate of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, **the largest mainstream scientific organization in the world**.\n\nYeah, that isn't true. Parapsychology is not part of the the largest mainstream scientific organization in the world.\n\nYou were lied to and you believe it because you have the type of mind to believe disreputable sites and listen to hacks.\n\n>**Anyone who claims that parapsychology is a pseudoscience doesn't know what they're talking about.**\n\nNo, it's those that claim parapsychology is mainstream science who does not know what they are talking about.\n\n>So if you think parapsychology is unscientific then why is Parapsychology an AAAS member?\n\nIt's not. That's a lie that you have been fed and you are happy to believe it because you are not part of the mainstream scientific community\n\n>Maybe you have an axe to grind in this debate\n\nMe thinking you are gullible isn't having an ax to grind.\n\n>you lack the evidence to actually prove that\n\nNo I don't. There's tons of evidence on my side. Parapsychology is an unsubstantiated pseudo science. Go look it up within the American Psychological Association, in Washington, D.C., which is actually the largest scientific and professional organization representing psychology in the United States and is the world's largest association of psychologists."
