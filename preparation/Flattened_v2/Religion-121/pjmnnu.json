So a life is being taken. So I dont care about what you believe I want the state to take action against it.\n\n\nIts similar to if you worshiped baal or molech and sacrificed your born infant to your God. I dont really care what you believe but you cant sacrifice your children as a form of worship."

If not when does it gain the right to life?\n\nThe zygote formed at conception has fully formed DNA that makes a unique person a person genetically. That and a positive pregnancy diagnosis is a solid case that its a human life with rights.\n\nMany pro choicers agree that its a human life with rights but they believe the right to bodily autonomy allows the mother to end it at will."

Those are the exceptions and typically involve very emotional choices for the mother because late term abortions are done when there are significant health risks.  Nearly 90% of all abortions are done within 12 weeks, and 66% of those are within 8 weeks.\n\nIt's time to get away from the absurd argument about people killing 9 month old babies.  No one is arguing for that."

If course not, because you would say that the chocolate cake does not have a life, and thus you will continue to eat chocolate cake whenever you please.\n\nThis is the same situation, but with a fertilised egg instead. Just because you believe it has a life, does not mean that everyone has to abide by those rules. We see other places where these lines are blurred, such as terminally ill patients that are in a coma. Letting them die, as sad as it is for the family, will free up beds for others who might be more lucid or have a chance to recover. Such topics are debated at length, and choices are usually on case by case basis based on what the individual and the family believe/want."

So there is that dilemma too with your view.\n\n\nIf you are strongly convicted enough to impose the will of the state on me over a food item, go for it buddy. Thats all I have to say to that.

Their dna was no less \"fully formed\", be consistent!\n\nMost Christians didn't even make this a part of their religion until their politicians told them to, your strongly held belief was implanted for no reason but to be a wedge issue and you're happy to punish women and doctors and people who only want to help women just because Newt Gingrich and Jerry Falwell told you to, not God."

    "text": "I think you are missing my point. I am not claiming that the cake has a life, since we both know it doesn't. I am using an object that you would claim doesn't have a life, so you can see abortion laws from a pro-choice perspective.\n\nThat being said, I will answer your question about whether I would want to prevent abortions if I believe the zygote has a life. I would, firstly, make sure to use contraception myself, to mitigate the risk of unwanted pregnancies and promote the use contraception to others. Let's say despite this, I find myself in the position where I need to make a choice between an abortion or keeping the child, unless it would risk the mother's life, I would promote keeping the child. However, I would not want the state to enforce this belief, since I understand that not everyone holds this opinion, and thus, this should be a personal choice.\n\nAnother thing to consider in this case, is also the wellbeing of the mother. Even if I believe the zygote has a life, killing it may still be the more admirable option if keeping it could severely harm the mother, which in turn would hurt the child in the long run.\n\nNow, I ask you the same question but in reverse. If you saw the zygote as without a life, would you still be against abortion and would you still want the state to enforce a ban on abortions? Why or why not?\n\nPS: I need to sleep now, but will get back to you in a few hours time if you respond."

I am pro abortion only to save the mothers life, and thats purely physical. I dont believe in mental reasons for abortion.\n\nHaving some experience with mental health, I would be for medicating the women if she desperately needs it, IE having a major episode of like skitzo or something. If there is a safer for the baby option in medications I would prefer that, but if you have to risk the baby go for it.\n\n\nThats not the same thing as aborting it though. Its important to recognize the difference and unfortunately laws can sometimes get in the way of that."
