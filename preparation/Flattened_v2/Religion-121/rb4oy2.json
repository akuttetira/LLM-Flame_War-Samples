No happiness\n\nWhen you say \"no happiness\", is it your view that no atheist has ever been happy? When you say that happiness includes ups and downs, is it your view that atheists never experience ups and downs? Is this view limited only to atheists, or does it also include anyone who believes in different gods than you might?"

We’re at the top of the food chain on this planet. Our curiosity which has resulted in our deep understanding of the universe is what got us here. It is our understanding of the universe that has allowed us to create this world.\n\nSeems like evolution did it’s job with us. The side effects being that we can now contemplate other more advanced ideas as we progress past satisfying our bare necessities.\n\nIt is our understanding of the truth that has gotten here. Understanding the truth has proved to be the best way to survive and I can provide countless examples of that. Least of which being our understanding of disease and modern medicine. The understanding of the truth, that diseases are organisms that can be combatted and not supernatural fate, being just one.\n\nEdit: Our curiosity and quest to understand the truth is what has resulted in our progress, so evolving to know the truth and evolving to survive are one and the same in the case of humanity."

But also note you say \"if proven\".\n\n>Yet you are the same people who reject religion and God's existence based on evil\n\nThe main reason would be lack of evidence. But the evil thing is because this contradicts another claim that god is both all good and all powerful. So it's not \"evil exists therefore no God\", its \"evil exists therefore theres no all good, all powerful God\".\n\n>Atheists lose meaning and are more prone to suicide.\n\nEven if this statistic is true there can be a number of other democratic and cultural factors at play and there may be differences by country. And note you're taking about atheist, not atheism. If demographics changed and the suicide rate swapped would this make you lose your religion? Maybe these people haven't read my post yet.\n\nRegarding meaning. Yes there is no 'prescribed' meaning, but there can still be meaning. Imagine if I teleported you to the middle of italy right now, for no reason. Assuming you were safe and had enough money, would you mope around saying \"there's no reason for why I'm here\"? Or would you grasp the opportunity and do a load of interesting tourist things? You would have no 'prescribed' reason to be in Italy. No one has given you a specific reason to be there. Does this mean you can't find meaning or aims or enjoyment? No. You just find the meaning yourself."
