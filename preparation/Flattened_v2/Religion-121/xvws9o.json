The two are inextricably linked in concept.\n\nAnd you don’t get to decide where people derive their moral standards from in a democratic election.\n\nFor you to try to wag your finger and tell Christians that their morality is not allowed to influence their voting is the ultimate hypocrisy on your part as you are effectively trying to enforce an atheistic theocracy. The same thing communists do."

    "text": "As a lawyer, I can assure you that the EC is being eroded to effectively be written out of the Constitution, at least in the way it has been understood for pretty much forever. Of course they aren’t outright calling for its removal—they don’t need to. They have a sympathetic SCOTUS.\n\nYour morality diatribe is similarly flawed. Laws affecting everyone should not be based on a singular, rather narrow moral code. You’ve tacitly acknowledged this: “law is . . . what *society has decided* are the moral standards.” The problem with Christian Nationalists and many evangelicals is that they wish to impart their narrow, often minority position upon people. Marriage equality and abortion access are majority positions, but you wouldn’t think that based on the way many “Christian “ politicians speak and vote.\n\nLastly, once you’ve pulled the “communist card,” you’ve lost."

Look up polls on abortion rights (60% support them being unrestricted) or Gay Marriage (even higher I believe)\n\nYour elections aren't very free. But you have a large % (about 30%) of crazy people who think the US is a Christian county (hint, it isn't) and who don't want separation of Church and State. And funny they want to wreck that bit of the constitution, yet the 2A or other bits aren't at risk\n\nSo almost like an extremist minority are stacking everything in their favour\n\nAnd lol, as the other guy said, your cries of communism show you to be exactly the kind of person we are talking about, and it invalidates any credibility from your argument"

The later makes you guilty of the logical fallacy of arguing in bad faith.\n\nIf your claim of being a lawyer were true then it would not be surprising if you are comfortable with making knowingly dishonest arguments in an effort to win an argument. That might be allowed in a courtroom but it isn’t allowed in a logical debate.\n\nIf you thought you were making an honest and valid argument then it does not bode well for your career as a lawyer because a strong grasp of logic is necessary to be a good one.\n\n> Nobody said anything about voting\n\nYou cannot point to any particular action American Christians have done which you find objectionable other than the fact that you don’t like who they are voting into power.\n\nSo the only implication of your screed against Christians is you don’t want them voting consistent with their morals.\n\nYou cannot point to anything else they have done and give any logical reason why it is objectionable.\n\nBut voting consistent with your morals is not a crime, it is not unconstitutional, it is not immoral, it is not unethical - it is the very basis upon which our voting system functions.\n\nYou do it. You expect other atheists to do it too. So you are a hypocrite for acting like Christians are somehow wrong for doing the same thing.\n\nWhat is it called when your side gets to have a voice by the other side doesn’t? Authoritarianism. As in Fascism or Communism.\n\nLike most hardcore leftists in America today you are an authoritarian at heart. You want to silence your opposition by force because you cannot win on the battleground of ideas.\n\nGetting into a tit for tat over democrat crimes at polling places is not relevant or necessary when your statements and behavior already demonstrate that you resent Christians for doing nothing other than for voting consistent with their morals and act like they have committed some kind of crime by doing so.\n\nIf you resent Christians for voting consistent with their morals and want to try to use the bludgeon of the corporate media weapon system to intimidate or shame them into not doing that (by making up scary sounding labels for them and lumping them in with nazi groups and the KKK - the leftist go-to tactic of just calling everyone that disagrees with them racist),  then you cannot claim to honestly be concerned about voting integrity - you are only concerned with your side winning at any cost."

    "text": "> You said \"You admit no one is trying to change the constitution.\" and I provided evidence of people who are trying to change the constitution\n\nLogical fallacy, strawman. The context of my statement was you claiming people wanted to remove the establish clause from the constitution.\n\nYou do not prove your claim that people want to remove the establishment clause of the constitution by pointing to someone who wants to change the constitution but does not want to remove the establishment clause.\n\nThe fact that you think your links is proof of your claim therefore shows you either lack basic abilities to form sound logical connections in making arguments, or you are being intentionally dishonest by making an argument you know is fallacious and hoping you just don’t get called out on it.\n\n\n> Here's your quote from elected official Republican U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert said: \"The church is supposed to direct the government. The government is not supposed to direct the church.\"\n\nThat is not expressing a desire to remove the establishment clause from the constitution.\n\nFirstly, because you fail to understand the the “church” in the Bible is just a word for the body of believers in Jesus.\n\nSecondly, because you fail to apply the proper context of that quote which is that the government has no business telling the church what they are to do but because we are a democratically elected government the people have business telling the government what to do.\n\nWith 63% of the American population estimated to identify ad Christian, and our system is governed by majority vote, it is an accurate statement to say that the church (the body of Christian followers as a whole) are the ones who tell the government what to do. And the government does not get to tell them what to do.\n\nThe former is how a democratically elected republic works.\n\nThe later is how authoritarianism works.\n\n> You keep talking about voting and OP is talking about barring government from respecting an establishment of religion as stated in the Constitution.\n\nYou couldn’t prove anyone wants to actually remove the establishment clause.\n\nSo what are these so-called “christian nationalists” doing that has you so upset?\n\nYou can’t point to anything they have done other than simply vote for candidates that are consistent with their moral values.\n\nAnd if you are against letting Christians vote consistent with their morals, while you feel free to do it as an atheist, then that just makes you an authoritarian fascist/communist who wants to silence political opposition by force.\n\nYou cannot even coherently define what that term “christian nationalist” means.\n\nIt is just a demonizing label the corporate media has invented to slap onto any Christian that they find politically difficult to deal with.\n\nWhat they are really saying is that if you actually believe your faith and advocate people vote consistent with it’s morals then you are wrong and must be demonized until you go in the closet.\n\nBut if you are one of the “good” christians who agrees with what the world says is true and keeps quiet, then we won’t call you a racist all over corporate media."
