It means that even the pains of Hell, as bad as they are, and as much as God doesn't want them for their own sake, are to God worth it for the existence of the person who is damned. God's love (which is, fundamentally, his will that we exist, and accomplish to the degree we can the intrinsic ends of that existence) rightly embraces not only the morally and spiritually successful, but the unsuccessful as well."

You know that if you have sex with you significant other a child will be born which will have a terrible terrible life because of it's own choices. It grows up and gets to become a rapist. Eventually your child gets caught and gets to be in prison for the rest of his life under horrible conditions. Do you really think it would be loving of you to choose to have that child anyway?\nYou must think so based on what you are saying. It must be even more clear in my scenario, because the child gets to live and he isn't tortured for the whole of time."

It is precisely because my child does not exist yet, and I have not chosen to love him yet, that it is thinkable (and perhaps advisable, since I am not required to love him yet) not to have the child. You might object, if I have the child, that I was not loving toward his victims, but it would not be possible to say that I was not loving toward the child.\n\nLikewise, the founder of a city or a nation, if he is at all versed in the histories of cities or nations, can foresee with certainty all the evil which would be brought about by this founding. We wouldn't say that the founder is unloving toward that city merely because he foresaw the evils that would have resulted and decided that the inherent costs were worth it anyway.\n\nIn short, it makes perfect sense."

    "text": ">can foresee with certainty all the evil which would be brought about by this founding.\n\nHe can also foresee that not founding the nation would be worse, just look at any nation that should exist but doesn't. It's people suffer more and they are hunted down, never allowed to create a nation, ruled by other nations.\n\n\n>If I love my child, and want him to accomplish his interests to the degree that he can, then of course I have to will him to exist\n\nNo, in my example he is not going to accomplish his goals, the only thing he is going to accomplish is rape, which while you could argue it's good for him, it's really not good for anyone else and maybe not even for him.\n\n>You might object, if I have the child, that I was not loving toward his victims, but it would not be possible to say that I was not loving toward the child.\n\nWhy not? It is possible and I am saying that. It's not a loving thing to do at all. Let's say that somehow, magically, we take away all of the suffering that his raping caused. It's still not loving to bring him to life because he will essentially sufer most of his life in prison. This certainly wasn't his goal but of course you got to twist things to say that he is achieving his goals. He is not. He is failing and suffering greatly, what was the point of it?\n\n> We wouldn't say that the founder is unloving toward that city merely because he foresaw the evils that would have resulted and decided that the inherent costs were worth it anyway.\n\nIn that case it was clearly worth it, but in what way is it worth it to live a life behind bars suffering greatly?\n\n\nAnd you have to understand that hell is infinitely much worse. If the child got to live for an infinity and behind bars would you still do it? I am curious to see how inhumane you could get to defend your beliefs, thus far you are already quite inhumane in what you want to do.\n\n>In short, it makes perfect sense.\n\nNot at all. Christians that have a different idea of hell should probably be able to see how inhumane that is. Their idea of hell should not be eternal torment though and most christians believe that so it's only going to be a few that will just clearly see the problems with it."

    "text": ">This certainly wasn't his goal but of course you got to twist things to say that he is achieving his goals. He is not. He is failing and suffering greatly, what was the point of it?\n\nAs incredibly serious as the failure of rape and sufferings of imprisonment are, they are not complete privations of being-human. He would, for instance, still be the recipient of my love, still be made in the image of God. There are some goods which just can't be removed from us as long as we exist. We aren't reducible to the transient, subjective goals we conceive from time to time. Rather, we are constituted by the essential goals of the human agent as such: to know and love God and through him each other, and to be known by and beloved by others. As much has my son has lost, and as limited as his existence will be in prison, he hasn't actually lost everything.\n\nIf I genuinely love my child, I could not logically say that I wish he had never existed, no matter how badly things turn out. If I love someone, I abhor what takes away from them because I affirm their existence. The total privation of non-existence can never be preferable (even if, under abnormal conditions, it may seem so to the sufferer) to even a very meagre existence.  One who exists necessarily accomplishes more of the ends of human existence (even if it might be comparatively few next to a more successful person) than one who does not.\n\n>If the child got to live for an infinity and behind bars would you still do it? I am curious to see how inhumane you could get to defend your beliefs, thus far you are already quite inhumane in what you want to do.\n\nFirstly, Hell is, though not non-existence, certainly a form of death in Christianity, not everlasting life. It is permanent precisely because the capacity to exist in any other state has been lost: there is no multiplicity of future states that the damned could achieve, that are meaningfully continuous with the life he has led. That humans can lose their vitality and mobility is a perfectly ordinary fact about human existence. For the damned, just as for us who approach death without hope, the chief part of life, for the sake of which our existence was made, has become something lying mainly (but not completely) in the past.\n\nOn even the severest doctrine of Hell, however, even the worst human existence does not come to *nothing* in the end, even if it comes to very little. As little as the damned may have served God, his fellow-man, or himself, God at least does not relinquish his love of the damned. The pains and privations of Hell manifest the true condition of a soul, once the temporary life he has enjoyed runs its allotted course, but as long as he exists, such a soul manifests *some* good. The pains and privations of Hell, as bad as they are, are permitted for the sake of the existence of the damned themselves.\n\nTo bring it back to more familiar reality, the whole underpinning of my position is that since we avoid privation because it takes away from our fulfilment, and because we achieve that fulfilment to some degree as long as we exist, it is never preferrable to one who wills fulfilment for us to will that we had never been. This reminds us of what is fundamentally at stake in our relations with each other- if the chief object of concern is our fellow human beings, we are not merely trying to minimise suffering, but to affirm being, and between the two the latter has to come first, on pain of incoherence."

    "text": ">He would, for instance, still be the recipient of my love, still be made in the image of God.\n\nThose are huge nonsense that only theists can believe. We are not made in the image of God in any sense. God is omnipotent, we are not, god is omniscient, we are not, god is omnibenevolent, we are not, god is immaterial, we are not, god is timeless, we are not, god is non contingent, we are not, god is perfect, we are not, god doesn't exist, we do.\nAnyway, yes he would be loved by you(although perhaps once he got to be a rapist you would hate him) but your love won't do much if he is spending his life in prison in horrible conditions.\n\n\n>There are some goods which just can't be removed from us as long as we exist.\n\nWhich can be vastly overwhelmed by evils which can only be removed if we die. But at that point it's often too late as we also have this instinct that will stop us from harming ourselves which means even when it becomes the best option, we do not want to do it. So we keep on suffering wishing it would end.\nUnless of course it gets so bad that we snap and end up doing it anyway.\nGod in the meantime knows this will happen and just lets it be just as any heartless creature would have done. But theists, they do not like this, so they go on to defend how it must be that it was worth it when it is crystal clear it is not worth it, especially when it comes to hell, an infinite torture.\nBut of course that's just god being just, not heartless. He loves you but out of your choice you end up getting tortured for infinity. How does that even make sense to theists I do not know.\n\n>Rather, we are constituted by the essential goals of the human agent as such: to know and love God and through him each other, and to be known by and beloved by others.\n\nBut we don't get to know god. Even theists do not, they merely claim to. It's like my girlfriend that you don't know because she goes to another school.\nNot everyone has the same goals and while our goals do not make us what we are, they make us happy or not. Suffering is something we do not want and if we are suffering hard enough, at some point it becomes better to have never existed in the first place. Or even just die. But god, won't ever give us that choice noooooo we sinned and we have to burn for an eternity. But he loves us, he really does and it's our fault.\nI mean I say these to show that it's bullshit and yet theists read it and somehow agree...\n\n>As much has my son has lost, and as limited as his existence will be in prison, he hasn't actually lost everything.\n\nHe has lost his life. His life was so bad, that his non-existence was more blissful than his existence. Non-existence isn't inherently bad and existence isn't inherently good. It's the experience of that existence that is going to determine that. Locked in prison, he just suffers and feels bad that he couldn't control himself or whatever reason made him do it. He feels so bad about himself that he thinks it would have been better if he didn't exist.\nOr maybe he doesn't think that but let's say he does, because god would have known his future thoughts and yet not choose to do anything about it and god knows his current thoughts and still does nothing about it.\n\n>If I genuinely love my child, I could not logically say that I wish he had never existed, no matter how badly things turn out.\n\nWhy not? If he didn't exist it would be neither bad nor good. But now that he does and his life went to hell how could it not be better if he had not existed and had to suffer? The cherry on top, he is likely going to hell after that.\n\n> One who exists necessarily accomplishes more of the ends of human existence (even if it might be comparatively few next to a more successful person) than one who does not.\n\nHe also accomplished a lot of the things that he didn't want to. You can't just look at the positives without taking into account the negatives as well.\n\n>Firstly, Hell is, though not non-existence, certainly a form of death in Christianity, not everlasting life.\n\nNo. It's eternal suffering which means eternal life. The dead do not suffer. God doesn't even have the decency to end the lives of those who would rather die than be infinitely tortured(which should be any rational entity)\n\n>It is permanent precisely because the capacity to exist in any other state has been lost\n\nThat's not true, god could administer any just punishment(including just getting rid of them and letting them die) and then get rid of them(or not, if they, for whatever reason, wish to continue living, but hopefully not through a stupid instinct that forces them to continue even when they know dying is much better for them)\n\n>God at least does not relinquish his love of the damned.\n\nYes, and he shows that by torturing the damned for an eternity because they did what he did not like. If he didn't love them, he would do something silly, like allow them into heaven anyway.\n\n>The pains and privations of Hell manifest the true condition of a soul, once the temporary life he has enjoyed runs its allotted course, but as long as he exists, such a soul manifests some good.\n\nMore made up stuff. There is no such thing as a soul.\nBut even if there was, there would be no evidence that being mean would lead to a soul that gets tortured and even an omnipotent being could not stop that in any way(you know, other than intervening early which of course god can't do because theists aren't devoid of excuses)\n\n>such a soul manifests some good.\n\nI am listening, what good is that and how is that more important than infinite evil?\n\n>The pains and privations of Hell, as bad as they are, are permitted for the sake of the existence of the damned themselves.\n\nDo they have a choice to kill themselves? If not it's not permitted but forced.\nAlso, without those pains and privations the damned would still get to live if god wanted to. There's nothing about their existence that depends on those pains and privations that's just more made up stuff. Theists make up stuff when they can't defend their positions, don't they?\n\n>since we avoid privation because it takes away from our fulfilment,\n\nLet me rephrase so that this makes more sense.\nWe avoid suffering because our goal is our well-being.\n\n\n>\nand because we achieve that fulfilment to some degree as long as we exist\n\n\nAnd we do not achive well being, at least not always and not to some degree...\n\n>This reminds us of what is fundamentally at stake in our relations with each other- if the chief object of concern is our fellow human beings, we are not merely trying to minimise suffering, but to affirm being, and between the two the latter has to come first, on pain of incoherence.\n\nAnd god does not do that..."

It sounds like an abusive partner making up some bullshit to fit his narrative as to why he abuses you. It seems like abusive behavior to you and to the police and to your friends and everyone else, but that's because those people just don't understand how much he loves you and and **how** he loves you and how he is trying ultimately to protect you and help you. It is for your own good!\n\nAnyway, it seems pretty easy to come up with some ad hoc definition of love to justify all manner of behavior. I think your argument will fall on deaf ears because of that."

    "text": "Any sound definition of love has to will the good for the object of that love, and the good is in turn rooted in what it is for them to exist. It's impossible even for us to look out for anyone's genuine interests apart from willing their existence and its ends. It also explains why love in us is an echo of the most-fundamental reality who, through willing his creations to be, loves all reality into being. No one is forced to listen, of course, but they'll benefit if they do— whether they realise it or not, they are already loving in this way, even if unconsciously. Refining the concept of love in the Christian fashion shows why love is the supreme virtue as Christians have always claimed it is: all other virtues pursue some aspect of the human good, i.e., of human existence, but it is love that wills that existence per se, and hence, wills the good per se.\n\nThis sort of love is excellently motivated: it illuminates why love is so ethically important on a purely human level, is the sort of love that it makes sense to attribute to the Creator, it satisfies our longing for a fundamental affirmation of our existence that does not merely leave us as we happen to be, and to boot, defuses the problem of evil. It is quite difficult to call a concept in which natural theology, ethics, and fundamental metaphysics neatly conceptually converge 'ad-hoc.'\n\nIt's a very odd argument that an abuser can spin a self-serving story using the name of some virtue, therefore that virtue is not a virtue. Virtues are useful to abusers precisely because they are genuine virtues. An abuser can misuse courage, for instance, by appealing to the very true principle that some things are worth fighting for, and it is worth enduring tremendous hardship to achieve (therefore, stick with me). That doesn't mean courage is not a virtue!\n\nOne can oppose an abuser only by willing the genuine good of the victim, as founded in a correct understanding of the nature of the human person and a person's intrinsic ends. When one wills the good of the victim, one conforms one's will to the will of the Creator for that victim, since the person's intrinsic ends just are the ends that properly belong to them as the kind of thing they are. By willing these ends, we also oppose privations inflicted upon that victim (since they take away from that victim's existence), but at the same time, we are not so eager to eliminate those privations that we would eliminate the victim themselves (since, after all, it is their positive existence, and not merely the absence of privations, which we seek). Just so with God: because he loves us, he wills the good for us, and because he loves us, he also permits the evils (including Hell) that make up our nature."

It's impossible even for us to look\nout for anyone's genuine interests apart from willing their existence and its ends.\n\nWell, it seems like Jesus does not agree with your definition of love. Talking about Judas, Jesus foresaw his fate and ultimate destruction and said it would have been **better** if Judas **had not been born**:\n\nMatthew 26:24:\n\n\"The Son of man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! **It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.\"**\n\nIf I could predict that my child would be born deaf, blind, dumb, deformed limbs, in constant physical pain, I would not will him to exist. I would spare him the suffering. That seems more like love to me. Seems like Jesus would also agree it would **be better** for someone not to exist than suffer a terrible fate.\n\n>Refining the concept of love in the Christian fashion\n\nNot all Christians have historically believed in eternal hell. Some believed in annihilationism. Some in universalism. This includes some church fathers. Jesus might have been an annihilationist. Maybe not. NT scholars debate this point also.  And who knows what other Christian groups believed that are now lost to history?\n\nWhat you're talking about is a concept of love that has been sophisticatedly fashioned to agree conveniently with later medieval Christians. And, again, that is no different from anyone else using a concept of love for their own purposes. So who is right about love? Maybe the universalists? Hmm, maybe the Sikhs?\n\n\n>It's a very odd argument that an abuser can spin a self-serving story using the name of some virtue, therefore that virtue is not a virtue.\n\nThat is an odd argument. And I never made it. I never said love does not exist because an abuser can misuse it."
