    "text": "This argument appeared around 120 years ago. Did nobody noticed? They knew. The difference is that around 120 years ago there was a moved to make age more strict and attach laws to that particular age. So it's not a coincidence and part of why it's fallacious argument.\n\nAisha r.a. herself stated that she was a women at 9. It doesn't get more direct than that. Either you accept it or some form of dictating to her how she didn't know what she was talking about.\n\nAt the time there was no such thing as teenage, it was child or adult. Hence this concept that 'a 9 year old is a child in today's society and therefore she must have been a child then at that age back then' is ahistorical no matter how much one dislikes it. Any kind of accurate usage of the term age as it is applied to back then would have to recognizes that it had a more fluid application across human history.\n\nIf presentism is okay then subjective transitory morals are okay as a standard of truth. If someone actually thinks that then they have an absolutely horrible standard of truth. If truth can be both right and wrong then truth can be contradictory and thus there is no standard of truth as there is nothing to differentiate one being true and the other false.\n\nAisha like all the wives of the Prophet had a choice, specifically given by Allah in the Quran, to leave if she so wished. Same goes for all arranged marriages, she still has the choice to refuse. So any claim that she had to stay etc are kind of silly. Same for claims of trauma by taking some hadiths and twisting them. It's a less than intellectual approach to toss around terms that don't even apply.\n\nSomeone said it's the colloquial usage of pedophilia, yeah it is, because none of the signs/indicators of trauma from pedophilia are present in Aisha's narrations/hadiths. Rather we find the opposite, a loving and healthy relationship that shouldn't exist if the claim was actually true. Remember they were together about a decade and then she lived on narrating hadiths for several decades later. She was someone that excelled in all aspects of life and would become one of the greatest scholars and muhaddithan in Islam.\n\nThe actual standard of marriageable age in Islam is not tied to age and since the argument is relying on this claim of pedophilia to then claim he is a bad role model that humans in general can't accept I addressed the pedophilia claim.\n\nI don't get your edit, it makes it seem like your judgement of him is supposed to be some kind of standard of truth that comes to a truth??? Also don't get the \"however please remember that this is still presentism\", as presentism is a fallacy."

    "text": "Nope. Roman doctors almost 2000 years ago criticized sex with pre-pubescent minors. Persian and Byzantine law contemporary to the Quran were stricter on this, on the age and the capability to consent. Even the ancient Hebrew Bible clearly implies that maturity is a condition for active sexuality (and I am far from a biblical apologist): Ezekiel 16:7-8, for example. Also, in a less detailed manner, in the N.T.: 1Corinthians 7:36.\n\n>Same goes for all arranged marriages, she still has the choice to refuse\n\nThat's also a lie, since the Hanbalis, for instance, reject the need for the consent of the young girl (if that were even possible)."

In that case, they have no option to annul the marriage."

Roman doctors almost 2000 years ago criticized sex with pre-pubescent minors.\n\nShow me how they or anyone else criticized the Prophet's marriage to Aisha the last 1250 years, if they thought it was sex with a minor and wanted to swear him why did they wait 1250 years to do it? Bring some evidence it's not a relatively recent argument against Muhammad. Surely if they thought it an example against him they would have used it just as they've used every other slander against him the last 1320 years.\n\nShe herself said that a girl becomes a women at 9 years old, not a minor/girl i.e. puberty had been reached. Her statement is not unique nor was her arranged marriage unique, they would arrange a marriage, but not live with each other until both had reached puberty.\n\nAs for arranged marriages, yes if the girl is silent then that is taken as enough approval. If she is against it and says so then it doesn't happen. So any claims of forcing is playing off that."

    "text": ">Show me how they or anyone else criticized the Prophet's marriage to Aisha the last 1250 years\n\nI don't need to, I quoted even older criticism of that practice. And you would just dismiss them anyway, like you do with Zaynab's case (a very popular old criticism). The best one can say is that older Christian polemics and such were more revolted by Zaynab's case, given it's plausible they knew about Aisha.\n\n>She herself said that a girl becomes a women at 9 years old, not a minor/girl i.e. puberty had been reached\n\nThere's zero evidence she had reached puberty (see Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani's comment on Bukhari 6130), AND a girl doesn't become mature after bleeding for the first time.\n\n>they would arrange a marriage, but not live with each other until both had reached puberty.\n\nCorrect. But not people with 45 years of difference, and again, not the case above, and not the case required by Islam (Sura 65:4 implies pre-pubescent consummation, don't know how many million of times more I will have to say this...)\n\n>As for arranged marriages, yes if the girl is silent then that is taken as enough approval. If she is against it and says so then it doesn't happen. So any claims of forcing is playing off that.\n\nFalse. The Hanafis take her opinion into account, the Hanbalis at least do not, even if she refuses."

    "text": "> I don't need to, I quoted even older criticism of that practice.\n\nI did not present an argument that stated Aisha is a minor and nobody criticized sex with a minor before, if I had then your statement about Romans would have been relevant. Find someone pointing to Muhammad's marriage to Aisha and saying she was a minor therefore it was wrong as to show my claim about the historicity of the argument and it's timing is false. Otherwise it is as I stated, it's a recent argument based around presentism where people try to impose their subjective definitions and morals inaccurately/ahistorically.\n\n> There's zero evidence she had reached puberty (see Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani's comment on Bukhari 6130), AND a girl doesn't become mature after bleeding for the first time.\n\nFirst of all that's one commentary on one hadith about Aisha when she lived with her parents, not about when she had moved out. It can easily be placed before the other hadiths stating that she had in fact reached the age of puberty.\n\nAisha's own statements is literally the best evidence one can get about Aisha and whether she had reached puberty.\n\nNarrated Aisha: I had seen my parents following Islam since I attained the age of puberty. Not a day passed but the Prophet visited us, both in the mornings and evenings.” - Sahih al-Bukhari volume 1, Book 8, Hadith 465\n\nNarrated Aisha: \"When the girl becomes 9 years old, she has become a woman.\" - Jami at-Tirmidhi 1109\n\nSo zero evidence is completely false, actually the most direct and best evidence is right there. Rather than use someone's commentary , that doesn't even contradict, we have her own words clearly stating she had reached the age of puberty and that she was a woman. Now match that with Bukhari 6130 that you yourself brought forth. She had already reached the age of puberty during that time when Muhammad would visit Abu Bakr i.e. before moving in with him.\n\nAlso nobody said the standard for becoming a women/mature is she bleed once. That is not the standard in Islam nor does it mean sexual intercourse is now permitted. Both mental and physical attributes are needed so even one being present doesn't conclude the other is. In such a case that one isn't ready the marriage is consummated by seclusion, not sexual intercourse.\n\n> False. The Hanafis take her opinion into account, the Hanbalis at least do not, even if she refuses.\n\nThat's a difference in opinion, not binding, and besides the point as Hanafi nor Hanbali schools existed then. Both her and her parents all were in agreement. As stated before she could refuse after the fact by command of Allah.\n\nEdit: Just to make it clear there is prophetic hadith saying a girl can refuse without any qualitifier that it doesn't apply if she is a virgin or whatever. Book of Marriage, Tirmidhi Chapter: What Has Been Related About Coercing A Female Orphan To Marry\n\nThe Messenger of Allah said: \"An orphan is to be consulted about herself, then if she is silent that is her permission, and if she refuses, then do not authorize it (the marriage) for her\" (meaning: when she attains the age of puberty and refuses it.)\n\nhttps://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:1109\n\nStop reading known hate sites and pretending as if they inform you about Islam u/69PepperoniPickles69."

    "text": "I will annihilate you and your pathetic sources in one fell swoop to show just how useless it is to argue with your ilk. Here goes:\n\n>Narrated Aisha: I had seen my parents following Islam since I attained the age of puberty. Not a day passed but the Prophet visited us, both in the mornings and evenings.” - Sahih al-Bukhari volume 1, Book 8, Hadith 465\n\nNow I'll PROVE that the source you got that from, which I know what it is, is a LIAR. Why? Because that hadith does not have the word puberty or anything implying it in it. Translation by Dr. Bewley: \"It is related that 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, said, \"I have no **recollection** of my parents doing anything but following the deen of Islam. (...)\". The word there is \"'aql\" which in context simply means she could never remember a time when her parents were not Muslim. Furthermore, we know that's true, because Abu Bakr was already a Muslim far before she reached puberty (even if we grant it was at 9). The whole argument is incoherent with your own sources. Still not convinced? Ok, I'll grant this was a genuine translation mistake. Now I'll demonstrate yet again how disgustingly dishonest some of your translators and sources are. Here's the way Sunnah.com has another one: Sunan Abu Dawud 4933 - \"(...) She halted me at the door, and I burst into laughter.\nAbu Dawud said: That is to say: I menstruated' (...)\" Now Muhsin-Khan's translation of the same \"She\nmade me stand at the door and I started to breathe deeply.\" (source: http://kalamullah.com/Books/Hadith/Sunan%20Abu%20Dawud%20Vol.%205%20-%204351-5274.pdf) Where did they get the idea the Arabic there ANYWHERE is refering to menstruation? It doesn't. The Arabic says \"Aisha went 'Heeh..heeh' - Abu Dawud explained, that means she breathed heavily\". It's all lies piled on lies piled on lies. The end."
