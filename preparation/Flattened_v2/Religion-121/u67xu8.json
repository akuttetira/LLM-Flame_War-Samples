The concept of the trinity has been defined by the authorities of the faith in a clear, precise philosophical language. There is nothing \"misty\" or \"vague\" about it, except maybe if you ask the layman who isn't familiar with the actual teaching. Just because you can't draw a 100\\_% accurate diagram of the transcendend Godhead doesn't mean it's illogical"

    "text": "Even though I think it's even debatable if the defintion of the Trinity as such really does violate the principle of non-contradiction (why would you and me sharing the same human nature while being yet distinct persons be any less \"contradictory\" than the three Persons/one Nature of God?), it should be remembered that the principle of non-contradiction only applies to ontological realities, i.e., to being. All the higher truths about God (who is the Principle of being and as such above being) transcend the principle of non-contradiction (he is omnipresent and nowhere, he is the being of all things while being nothing at all, etc.pp.). That doesn't make it illogical tho, since this transcending does itself follow a strict logic (i.e., *because* he is everywhere he is at no particular place and precisely because he is the being of all beings he is no being himself etc.). Contradiction pertains to creation, i.e., duality, but God is the place where opposites meet.\n\nHowever, the analogy of human and divine personality (even though it is quite true) is probably ill-advised because it too easily into the \"greek\" error of thinking of the hypostases as a kind of \"individual substance\", a \"center of consciousness\", or other such non-sense. There is only one Center, the divine Essence eternally deploying itself in the threefold relation of paternity, filiation and spiration."

    "text": ">\tyou and me sharing the same human nature\n\nWhat does that even mean? That we both like long walks on the beach? The Trinity doesn’t just “share the same nature”, they’re literally the same being. Last I checked, I am not you, because such a statement is a logical contradiction. If you’re happy with that conclusion, great!\n\n>\tthe principle of non-contradiction only applies to ontological realities\n\nThat’s just a fancy way of saying that logic doesn’t apply to gods. No justification backs up this claim, you simply assert it. Again, I’m fine with this, as it blows up every ontological argument for the existence of a god.\n\n>\tdivine personality … hypostases as a kind of “individual substance” … the divine Essence … paternity, filiation and spiration.\n\nI feel like I just walked into a psych ward and read ramblings on the wall covered in fecal matter. Using religious technobabble does not advance your argument."

As such both the ancient greek logicians as well as far-eastern systems of logic come to the same conclusion (even though buddhists for example don't even have any \"gods\"). But judging from the rest of your text you're just here to shitpost not to actually engange in philosophical discourse."

No citations, no argumentation, just “trust me bro, I’m a Catholic”. Inspirational.\n\nThis *is* a debate subreddit, right? Where are your arguments?"

I don't see how this has anything to do with magic."

We are 2 things that share certain attributes and certain states of being.\n\nI'm still not seeing how Jesus, God, and the holy spirit can be 1 thing, while also being 3 things."
