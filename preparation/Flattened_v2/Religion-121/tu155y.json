    "text": "Lots of missing context here to make things look bad. Lemme take a few on here.\n\n>The people spoke against God and against Moses, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and we detest this miserable food.” Then the Lord sent poisonous serpents among the people, and they bit the people, so that many Israelites died. Numbers 21:5-6\n\nOk yup that's a thing, what's the rest of Numbers 21?\n\n>“We sinned when we spoke against the Lord and against you. Pray that the Lord will take the snakes away from us.” So Moses prayed for the people.\n\n>8 The Lord said to Moses, “Make a snake and put it up on a pole; anyone who is bitten can look at it and live.” 9 So Moses made a bronze snake and put it up on a pole. Then when anyone was bitten by a snake and looked at the bronze snake, they lived.\n\nOk, so God made snakes, and then made a device to save them all. That's a *big* piece of missing context here. Suffice to say this is another \"sin leads to death, God is life\" story of which there are many.\n\nThe Passover, also seems quite like the above, rejecting God is death, following him is life.\n\n>Jesus said no one knew the Father, aka the real God, except him\n\nJesus *is* God, so yes he probably knows God in a way no human does. This isn't convincing at all.\n\n>The Bible and Christian doctrine is full of fear and guilt because Satan feeds off these negative emotions. This is why Satan had included hell, emphasized sin, set unreasonable standards, turned biological drives into a factory of guilt, etc.\n\nThis sounds like an opinion of how you feel it should make people feel. Christian doctrine is full of joy and hope. Easily dismissed.\n\n>God's apparent demand for worship. Only Satan would have an ego that needs to be stoked through worship.\n\nWorship is the respect due to something, specifically the creator and maintainer of the world. I'd say that's pretty reasonable ask to be respected for giving everything life.\n\n>The God of the Bible is very authoritarian. This is because Satan despises freedom and views humans as characters in The Sims that he can direct this way and that way.\n\nThis and your other \"this is because Satan dislikes X\" make no sense. Unlimited freedom and disobedience would be something Satan would *love*. Ultimate freedom to place yourself first and heed only your own desires? This is just a bad framing of what Satan is.\n\n> Perhaps the hidden names of the God of the Bible are meant to reveal the true identity of the God of the Bible.\n\n666 is (most likely) Nero Caesar. Revelation is not a prophecy but apocalyptic literature meant to bolster the faith of those living through persecution. A fairly common genre.\n\n>Make people afraid of deconverting: fear of eternal torment, fear of being wrong, fear of punishment, fear of wasted investment (sunk cost fallacy), fear of losing their sense of identity and belonging, etc.\n\nMost of the eternal torment discussion comes from the NT, not the OT which really makes your claim backwards. There *wasn't* a claim of eternal damnation common to OT works.\n\nAnd well, to go to what you say earlier.\n\n>Hell, eternal torment\n\nWe don't really know what Hell is aside from eternal separation from God, a lot of the eternal torment ideas are based on people's interpretations and writings like Dante.\n\n>nonsensical means to salvation\n\nNot even sure what you're aiming for here, there's a *ton* of writing about salvation in the Bible and beyond, and most of it makes sense (ok, Sola Fide doesn't but hey not everything is right).\n\n>The implication of this is that there were alternative views of Jesus that have been suppressed and the New Testament only contains the scriptures that the early religious leaders wanted people to be aware of.\n\nThe new testament is the books most commonly used at the time. The argument that \"it's the books the religious leaders wanted people to read\" is well, duh.\n\nThe Bible does not include a list of books to be included in the Bible. The Bible doesn't call for anything to be written down at all. There are *a lot* of works outside the Bible that have religious truth to them, and people *do* read them, the ones in the Bible were given special importance, but want to read the Doctors of the Church? Go for it. Papal encyclicals, have at it. The Bible is the start of Christian teaching, not the end.\n\nThe problem with the Gnostics was fundamental heretical views, they weren't \"Christian\" as we'd understand it. It *usually* a dualistic religion, and as such would be clearly heretical under the understanding of Christianity. Far more different than Protestantism and Orthodoxy.\n\n>Satan made it a virtue to believe something the more questionable it is, i.e., faith\n\nAgain if you're going for OT vs NT this is explicitly an issue. NT God also talks significantly about faith and the value of it.\n\n>Indoctrinate people from birth. People tend to stick to the religion/worldview they grew up with meaning the majority of people's beliefs are rooted in circumstance and have nothing to do with devotion to truth or objective thinking.\n\nYes people do tend to not seek truth, but the failure of humans to seek the truth doesn't really say anything except about humanity.\n\nI'm not convinced here."

    "text": ">Respect may be reasonable for that, but anyone who would ask for worship is not worthy of it, and anyone who would kill for lack of worship is not worthy of respect.\n\nThat's getting into way deeper theology than I can get into here, but the essence is the same, God as the Creator is due worship and respect.\n\nAs far as the killing for not, some of those cases are not literal cases. There's a lot of \"God is life, not God is death\" in the Bible, as a philosophy.\n\n>What is wrong with Sola Fide? What is an example of a means of salvation that makes sense?\n\nAside from Jesus himself saying it's not enough (Matthew 25 among many others), it's a novel doctrine created centuries after Jesus with no basis in theology, and tied into a doctrine of justification (Penal Substitution) that is wholly at odds with the general messages of Jesus. And is based on \"faith in Jesus is all you need to go to heaven, and the requirement\" when there's clearly people going to heaven *before Jesus*.\n\nSalvation is through the grace of God, not by virtue of having belief.\n\n>Justification establishes cooperation between God's grace and man's freedom. On man's part it is expressed by the assent of faith to the Word of God, which invites him to conversion, and in the cooperation of charity with the prompting of the Holy Spirit who precedes and preserves his assent:\n\nCatechism 1993, Sola Fide is the first half of that equation, but lacks the cooperation of charity that preserves your assent. Sola Fide is \"we're in a solid marriage because we said our vows, even if I'm a rampant cheater, and you're abusive\". It takes more than that, you have to work, respect each other, follow the vows, cooperate. That's how you get a good marriage. Salvation is different, but that's a basic allegory.\n\n>If Christianity as we understand it happens to be wrong in some details, then wouldn't that make heresy a good thing rather than a problem?\n\nExcept it's a heresy that doesn't make sense in any type of Christian doctrine. Dualism is pretty much a no-go from the start. Among other issues.\n\nAs a competing *different* religion if you want to argue that it makes sense, but it's wholly incompatible with Christianity. Like Arianism."

It is among the OG versions of Christianity. You are historically wrong and unread/ignoring on history of church and Council of Nicaea."

Isn't that exactly like Catholicism!  Hell,  christianity and bible as a whole!! Catholic are a sect, too , like Protestantism!! What an idiotic argument! This is infantile level stuff!!  Every religion is unsupported by anything other than itself !! Did anyone prove god yet?\n\nCatholics suffer from the same weak argument you heap on others. Jesus, does it echo when you talk? Having it too far up yours. Read up on Nicaea and try and be honest. After all what would jesus do? Not be pyreDruid, probably. Be Jewish, I guess.\n\nEdit: u/PyreDruid ran away, because it couldn't answer basic questions. Speaks volumes about its 'faith'."

OT examples of this.\n\n> What is required in order for a doctrine to be Christian? Wouldn't anyone who worships Jesus be technically Christian regardless of what else they believe?\n\n>What is particularly wrong with Dualism?\n\nAt a wide angle you can say belief is enough to claim Christianity. At some point though your sect becomes different enough in practice that “is it?”\n\nPeoples Temple was a “Christian sect”. But was it?\n\nNothing wrong with dualism per se, it’s just incompatible with Christian doctrine.\n\nChristian Doctrine starts at conforming to the teachings of Christ, gets a lot more complicated from there.\n\n> Is being compatible with Christianity more important than being true?\n\nThis is just begging the question."
