You merely need to imagine a universe which is **marginally** less perverse than the one in which we currently live, and then realize that it does not always take an all-powerful or an all-good being to prevent a marginal amount of suffering. There have been many, many agents who were merely as good as a human, who had access to merely human amounts of power, who nevertheless managed to make the universe a better place. People who have dedicated their lives to doing, slowly and imperfectly, what any halfway competent superagent **could**, and any halfway benevolent superagent **would**, do more cleanly and more thoroughly in half a second. No \"omni-\" anything necessary.\n\nIf one argues (as several users in this thread have argued) that not even an omniscient being could **ever** be capable of reducing the amount of suffering in this world without a corresponding reduction in one's Holiest-of-Holies of terminal values, then one must **by necessity** argue that Jonas Salk did a great moral wrong when he robbed millions of children of the \"freedom\" to experience the ravages of polio, and that Abraham Lincoln committed an atrocity when he deprived generations of Americans of the \"opportunity\" to live and die as chattel property on cotton plantations. One would not be *alone* in making either of those claims, but one should not expect to find oneself in very good company."

    "text": "I think it's trivially true as well, but the sheer number of apologists (or apologist wannabes) who insist that 'free will' is such a great good that it warrants the presence of easily preventable evils (for a deity) makes it such that the debates are non-trivial. It can be maddening.\n\nSomething that has struck me as odd is the fact that we know that humans have not existed for most of the lifespan of this universe. This raises several questions:\n\n* If 'free will' is so good, why did it take so long to show up?\n* Was it allowed to evolve naturally, or was it directed?\n* Are we to assume there have always been free agents in the universe? If so, are we to assume they evolved or their 'free will' was directed?\n\nI could go on and on, really, because while e.g. Plantinga's FWD is technically responsive to the logical PoE, it is preposterously implausible and unsatisfying while leaving open so many new questions regarding the logistics of 'free will,' all while bding a remarkably impotent *just so* story.\n\n...and never mind that it is not at all clear that 'free will' is coherent in the first place.\n\n---\n\nAnyway, I'm with you, but to actually make any headway with these types we must take the slow path, and even then they are more likely than not to simply abandon the discussion. I have seen it time and again that the most outspoken of these are those who tend to only engage where they perceive an advantage (read: where they think they can convince an unwitting interlocutor, but also where their arguments are quite unsuccessful; they prey on the unfamiliar or inexperienced), but they avoid those of us who actually mount a counter-offensive.\n\n---\n\nFWIW I *do* think that the evidentiary PoE would obtain even with what we might say are reasonable limits on evil or 'freedom of choice,' and that in this vein discussion over the *scales* of allowed evil are pointless. On my view, evil and choice (given theism) could have been limited minimally by causally isolating agents, or by dramatically limiting their ability to interact with one another. To wit, a deity could have placed all agents in the world into Nozick's Experience Machine, such that no agents truly interact, but they nonetheless experience things. This would allow for something like a generic set of life experiences while eliminating various particularly pernicious forms of evil.\n\nSuch a world would plausibly preserve 'free will' while eliminating those evils and while also being objectively better than this world, *ergo* a deity with the requisite abilities and moral character needed to create such a world does not exist."

Surely all the money, talent, and human caring which went into _Game of Thrones_ could have been redirected so that there was one less child rape in the world. But instead, we chose to be _entertained_. What does that say about us humans?\n\nPerhaps God is willing to be scapegoated in order to either goad us into acting in a _remotely_ responsible fashion, or saving up our accusations to pour back on us when God shows us all the times it would have taken approximately 0 more effort to treat humans better, but we chose the option to treat humans worse because it was the tiniest bit easier. Then evil grew and the cost of fighting it became modestly larger than 0. Did we then choose to fight it with all of our being? No. And so it grew even more. Only when it was really, really terrible—like child rape—did we recognize just how evil we are. And by that point, we couldn't seem to understand how to effectively fight it so that the amount of rape quickly goes to zero. So, we decided to blame God for not being a cosmic policeman.\n\nNow, possibly you will say that we humans, being merely evolved creatures quite used to raping each other, simply don't have what it takes. That could lead to a complaint that _God made us badly_. Of course you don't actually believe that—clearly you don't believe God exists or at least is not remotely good—but if you temporarily tried to believe that God created us, you would have to conclude that God did a really subpar job. Have I guessed remotely well? If I have, my next question is whether this stance of yours could possibly be falsified by any evidence—past, present, or future."

Furthermore, in _this_ world we learn much via destructive testing (e.g. those pasta bridges you might have built in middle school or high school, or [gene knockouts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockout)); how much of that would be disallowed because it would be 'evil', even if only the tiniest bit?\n\nHave you read anything or done any work on why people choose evil in the first place?
